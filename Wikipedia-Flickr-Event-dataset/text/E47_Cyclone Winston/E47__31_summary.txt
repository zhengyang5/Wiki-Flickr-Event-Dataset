/ Front page / NewsUpdate: 12:24AM The director of Tonga's emergency management office says food security is a major concern after cyclone Winston passed through the country twice this week.
However, Leveni 'Aho, the NEMO director, said Winston passed a fair distance to the north of Vava'u and the impact on the island group was not as great as feared.
Some 2,500 people had sought shelter in evacuation centres on Thursday night, but Mr 'Aho said only about 10 houses had been destroyed, with 200 others damaged.However, Mr 'Aho said there were concerns about crops that had been damaged.
"Most of the damage will be in the agricultural sector, so that will be the area that we will be looking at.
Leveni 'Aho said crews have been out on Friday clearing roads of fallen trees and power lines.
