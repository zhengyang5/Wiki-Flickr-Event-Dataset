“It’s clear that thousands of people have been affected in some way”, said Ahmad Sami, spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Fiji.
“In the coming days our teams will make sure that people are safe and that they have the help they need to get through the weeks ahead”, said Eseroma Ledua, Operations Manager at the Fiji Red Cross.
The first emergency response teams from the Fiji Red Cross left Suva today to begin assessing the damage and distributing relief supplies mainly in squatter settlements and evacuation centres near to the capital.
The IFRC is releasing funds from its Disaster Response Emergency Fund to support the Fiji Red Cross emergency operation.
The Fiji Red Cross is also launching a national appeal to raise funds.
