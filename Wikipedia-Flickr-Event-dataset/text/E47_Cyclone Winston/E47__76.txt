THE people of Vanuabalavu are grateful to the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) for their lead role in rehabilitating the severely-affected island in the aftermath of Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston.

Atelaita Cama, who is originally from Malaka Village, recently returned from the island and has praised the efforts of the visiting team.

"It was great to see our fellow islanders strong and recovering speedily. Thank you very much to the NZ forces who are working tirelessly on the ground in Vanuabalavu," Ms Cama said. About 270 New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) engineers and naval crew members are based on the island.

Commander Simon Rooke, Commanding Officer of HMNZS Canterbury, said the multi-role vessel — anchored off Lomaloma — was serving as the maritime hub for New Zealand's post-disaster recovery operations.

He said HMNZS Canterbury could support up to 366 people for 30 days without replenishing and they brought with them 106 tonnes of aid supplies.

Commander Rooke said aid supplies funded by the NZ Aid Program had been off-loaded using HMNZS Canterbury's landing craft and distributed to affected communities.

The ship's Seasprite helicopter has been transporting civilian medical volunteers from New Zealand and staff members from Fiji's National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) to nearby islands in the northern Lau archipelago.

HMNZS Canterbury is also converting seawater into drinking water to support the New Zealand contingent and to provide potable water to Lomaloma residents.

NDMO director Akapusi Tuifagalele said one of NZDF's main focus was the rehabilitation of schools in their quest to have normal classes resume immediately.
