Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced a $1.5 million increase to New Zealand’s aid package to Fiji as it recovers from Cyclone Winston. The announcement comes following Minister McCully’s visit to Fiji yesterday and takes New Zealand’s total support to over $4.7 million.

“The devastation caused by Cyclone Winston is very serious. Nearly 55,000 people remain in evacuation centres and the people of Fiji now face the difficult task of rebuilding their lives,” Mr McCully says.

“While humanitarian relief operations are continuing, the response is starting to move into the recovery phase, with a focus on restoring infrastructure such as electricity, water and transport.

“The contribution we have announced today includes $1 million to help repair power lines and infrastructure in some of the worse affected areas, and $500,000 for additional relief supplies and technical support.

“NZDF C-130s are continuing to deliver supplies in support of the relief operation. HMNZS Canterbury will arrive in Fiji tomorrow and is expected to join HMNZS Wellington in the Northern Lau group by the end of the week.

“New Zealand will support the Fiji Government as it works to recover from Cyclone Winston and we are currently developing a wider package of support focused on helping affected communities rebuild,” Mr McCully says.
