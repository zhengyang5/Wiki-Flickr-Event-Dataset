Update: 12:26PM AUSTRALIA is providing an initial $5million package of assistance to Fiji in an immediate response to the devastation caused by Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston.

In a statement, Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the package will support those in greatest need, facilitating the rapid release of pre-positioned stores and food items to assist people who remain in evacuation centres or who have been displaced due to the cyclone.

"These stores will ensure communities have access to safe drinking water and basic hygiene for those who have lost their houses or are displaced," she said.

Ms Bishop said Australia's thoughts were with the people of Fiji, particularly those who have lost family and friends as a result of the cyclone, the largest recorded to hit the country.
