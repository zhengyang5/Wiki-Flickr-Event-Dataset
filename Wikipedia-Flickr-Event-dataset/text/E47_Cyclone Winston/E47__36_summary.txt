Dangerous surf from ex-Cyclone Winston closes southern Queensland beachesUpdatedLarge, messy swells are lashing Queensland's south, closing dozens of beaches on Saturday and Sunday as ex-Tropical Cyclone Winston tracks off the coast.
The system is about 660 kilometres north-east of Brisbane, producing dangerous surf up to 4 metres high.
A body boarder was reported missing by two children just south of Tallebudgera, however Gold Coast City lifesaver Ken Lloyd said the search had been called off.
Combined with a south-easterly wind, surf conditions have been declared dangerous by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) and lifesavers.
All of the Gold Coast's 41 beaches are closed, and will be closed on Sunday as well, Surf Life Saving Queensland said.
