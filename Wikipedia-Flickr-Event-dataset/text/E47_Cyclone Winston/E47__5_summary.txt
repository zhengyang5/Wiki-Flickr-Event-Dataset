Cyclone Winston smashed into Fiji late Saturday, bringing with it wind gusts as high as 325km/h, to the main island Viti Levulate.
Winston, the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the South Pacific, had previously hit the country's eastern Lau group of islands.
"As a nation, we are facing an ordeal of the most grievous kind," said Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said in a statement urging people to heed authorities' warnings.
More than 700 evacuation centres had been activated throughout Fiji, and disaster authorities urged people in low-lying and exposed areas to evacuate before the cyclone set in.
As the tropical cyclone begun its assault on Fiji, Mr Bainimarama said: "Let us all pray for our nation, ourselves and each other."
