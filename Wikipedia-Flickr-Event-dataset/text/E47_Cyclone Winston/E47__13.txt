Representatives of the Fiji Roads Authority, Water Authority of Fiji and Fiji Electricity Authorities have been summoned to the Divisional Emergency Operations Centre in Labasa this morning to provide an update on restoration works in the Northern Division.

The representatives of the three essential services were not present during the emergency briefing this morning.

Tropical Cyclone Winston left a trail of destruction in the Bua Province, Savusavu and Taveuni.

Since yesterday, there has been a power blackout in the whole of Vanua Levu.

Most places are without water and there are downed trees, and power-lines as well as broken bridges, crossings and damaged roads.

Commissioner Northern Jovesa Vocea says the restoration of all essential services is governmentâ€™s priority at this stage.

Meanwhile, four teams are now leaving the Divisional Emergency Operations Centre in Labasa to conduct damage assessment.

The teams are to meet in Savusavu at 3pm to provide an update to the Commissioner Northern.
