The patrol vessel arrived into Suva from New Zealand yesterday where it picked up a few other RFMF personnel before heading straight to the Lau Group.
"They (Government) have highlighted the need for the Lau Group to be looked at and that is where we are concentrating at the moment.
"We will be on the Lau Group and so we will clear the way for the HMSNZS Canterbury to arrive later this week."
