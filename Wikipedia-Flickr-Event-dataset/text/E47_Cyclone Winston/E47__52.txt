MORE than 7000 people have benefitted from support services provided by west-based NGO Empower Pacific in the aftermath of Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston.

Chief executive officer Patrick Morgam said they deployed their first psychological first aid team of professional counsellors to affected areas immediately after the cyclone.

"Service personnel have been working tirelessly to reach and provide timely support to those who need psychological support to recover from the negative impact of the cyclone," Mr Morgam said.

According to Mr Morgam, the counselling aid would also help to foster short and long-term adaptive functioning and coping.

"It is humane, supportive and practical help provided to aid others who have experienced an extreme distressing event.

"Follow-up counselling support is also being offered to those who have been identified to be in need of long-term psychological support."
