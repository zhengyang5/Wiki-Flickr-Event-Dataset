All communications are down at the moment on the Islands of Vanuabalavu, Lakeba, Cicia and Nayau in the Lau Group.

Director DISMAC Akapusi Tuifagalele says this has made it difficult for them to get situation report on this areas.

Tuifagalele confirms these islands have felt the full brunt of Cyclone Winston this morning.

DISMAC will decide how to accommodate the needs of villagers living in the four islands in the coming hours.

“We are not getting through with communication so with the five category Tropical Cyclone Winston have gone through that area this morning that was expected and by now we know there will be a decision that will have to be made very soon and I hope that the emergency committee should make a decision in order to accommodate the needs of our people.”

Tuifagalele is pleading with all Fijians to take precautionary measures while it’s still daylight to avoid loss of life and property.
