FRENCH patrol boat La Moqueuse arrived in Suva from New Caledonia on Wednesday with two tonnes of shelter kits and hygiene kits to assist with relief operations in the wake of Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston.

French ambassador to Fiji Michel Djokovic said Fiji's National Disaster Management Office had emphasised the need for shelter and hygiene items in disaster affected areas and the French Government was responding to this.

Mr Djokovic said there were also 14 army engineers on board the vessel who would assist with rebuilding efforts on the islands of Lakeba, Cikobia and Tuvuca.

"The meteorological station in Lakeba is out of order and the military engineers on board will repair this station together with specialised equipment from the Fiji authorities."

He said the engineers would stay in the group for four days.

He said the French were happy to assist.

Mr Djokovic said the New Caledonia Government pledged $300,000 to be given to UNICEF and to the agricultural sector through Fiji Crop and livestock Council (FCLC).

The South Province of New Caledonia also pledged $400,000 for education and the North Province was finalising the details of their aid.

The vessel embarked on its relief mission yesterday.
