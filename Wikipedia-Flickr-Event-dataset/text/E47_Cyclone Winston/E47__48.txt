RETAIL giant Jack's of Fiji has pledged $200,000 to help with relief and rehabilitation efforts around the country following the devastation caused by Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston.

In a statement, the organisation said it was a sad time for the country as many had lost loved ones and were displaced from their homes.

"Jack's of Fiji regards itself fortunate as Nadi, our home base, was not severely affected," the statement read.

"Our other operations throughout the country also luckily escaped severe damage. We had prepared for the worst but have luckily escaped the full brunt of the cyclone. We deeply empathise with and feel for the rest of our people who have been greatly impacted."

Company chairman Dilip Khatri announced $100,000 was deposited in the Prime Minister's Relief Fund appeal to help speed up rehabilitation.

"To further support the Fijian Government's initiative to provide relief and assistance to the cyclone victims, we are closely working with the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism."

Parcels containing clothing will also be distributed to those severely affected. This will cost about $100,000.

"Jack's team members have already been mobilised in the West to assess the situation to substantiate the needs of the people. We will then personally distribute these packages to the affected communities."

The company has also offered their prayers and thoughts with all cyclone victims.
