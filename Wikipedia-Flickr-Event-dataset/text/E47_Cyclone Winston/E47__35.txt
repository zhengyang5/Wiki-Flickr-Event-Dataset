Surf Life Saving Queensland will keep Gold Coast beaches closed on Sunday, warning people again to refrain from swimming in dangerous surf.

A lucky kite surfer was winched to safety by the Surf Life Saving Queensland helicopter, which spotted him seven kilometres off Castaway Beach on one of their routine patrols. He was not injured, a SLSQ spokesperson said.

Life savers treated two spinal injuries on Saturday morning, when Noosa beach was open. It has sinced closed. And another swimmer suffered a dislocated shoulder after being dumped by a wave at Noosa. They were taken to hospital for treatment, the spokesman said.

By the end of the day all the beaches on the north and south coasts were closed due dangerous surf being whipped up by large swells from ex-cyclone Winston Strong.

SLSQ Gold Coast life saving services coordinator Nathan Fife said the beaches would remain closed in the interests of public safety.
