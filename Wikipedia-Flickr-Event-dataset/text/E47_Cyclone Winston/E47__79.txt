FIRST aid kits, tarpaulins and shelter tools have been delivered to Taveuni, Vanua Levu, by the French Airforce CASA.

The four-manned military aircraft, captained by Major Goujon Frederic, made its second trip to Matei via Labasa carrying 2.5 tonnes of supplies yesterday.

It made its first trip on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, the second French Airforce aircraft arrived at the Nadi International Airport from New Caledonia, and was expected to make another deployment of relief supplies to Matei.

On this aircraft are wash and hygiene products, and a water treatment unit — capable of producing 95 litres of drinkable water every minute, sourced either from a river or from the sea.

Major Frederic said after dropping off supplies at Matei, they would return to Nausori.

French deputy head of mission Jules Irrmann told this newspaper that the two aircraft in the country were being used here because of its ability to land on soft runways.

He said they were working closely with the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) to assist in the deployment of relief supplies.

He said it had been an emotional experience for their officers meeting the victims of the cyclone.

He said the people were touched when they saw help had begun to pour in.

Mr Irrmann said they were also working closely with Australia and New Zealand under their FRANZ Agreement.

The French Airforce mission departs next week.

Meanwhile, a team of 40 officers from the Australian Airforce arrived at Nausori from Brisbane yesterday morning, led by Wing Commander Mark Thompson.

Mr Thompson said they would join their comrades who had been in the country for the past several days, after a briefing at the Australian High Commission.
