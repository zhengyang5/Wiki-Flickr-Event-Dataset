Today I announce that Australia will provide additional assistance to Fiji as it responds to the devastation caused by Tropical Cyclone Winston.

This contribution builds on earlier assistance which delivered lifesaving support to people across the country within 48 hours of the cyclone.

Australia will allocate a further $10 million to provide food, clean water, hygiene, and shelter to communities recovering from Tropical Cyclone Winston. We will work closely with Fijian authorities to make urgent repairs to schools, medical clinics, and basic infrastructure.

The Australian Government will also provide further support to respond to urgent health needs of the Fijian people. We are sending a further 16 medical professionals to supplement the six person Australian medical team already working with Fijian health officials.

This new package of support brings the Australian Government’s assistance for Fiji to $15 million. Funding is complemented by the ongoing work of the Australian Defence Force with HMAS Canberra, Australia’s largest navy vessel, scheduled to arrive in Fiji within the next 24 hours.

Australia is the largest contributor to the international relief effort, and we stand ready to provide further assistance to support the people of Fiji should it be required.
