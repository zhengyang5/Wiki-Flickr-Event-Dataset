Update: 5:02PM THERE are 131 confirmed cases of dengue fever in the country.

With an increase in mosquito-borne diseases expected after the cyclone, people have been reminded to destroy mosquito breeding grounds.

"It is important that we take all necessary action to destroy these places so that mosquitoes do not breed," said Health and Medical Services Minister, Jone Usamate.

"Remember, if they breed, they will bite and spread diseases such as dengue, chikungunya or even Zika."
