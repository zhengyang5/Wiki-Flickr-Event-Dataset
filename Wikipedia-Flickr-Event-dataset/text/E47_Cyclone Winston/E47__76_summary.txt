Atelaita Cama, who is originally from Malaka Village, recently returned from the island and has praised the efforts of the visiting team.
About 270 New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) engineers and naval crew members are based on the island.
He said HMNZS Canterbury could support up to 366 people for 30 days without replenishing and they brought with them 106 tonnes of aid supplies.
Commander Rooke said aid supplies funded by the NZ Aid Program had been off-loaded using HMNZS Canterbury's landing craft and distributed to affected communities.
HMNZS Canterbury is also converting seawater into drinking water to support the New Zealand contingent and to provide potable water to Lomaloma residents.
