Update: 12:38PM THREE popular music groups that hail from Koro Island - one of the most severely affected by TC Winston - will perform at the Rise Up Fiji benefit concert at Sukuna Park in Suva this Saturday.

"Voqa Ni Delai Dokidoki, Malumu Ni Tobu and Savu Ni Delai Lomai have all put their hands up to perform at the event even though their homes on Koro Island have been completely destroyed," said show organiser Seru Serevi.

"We would like to urge the people of Suva to come out and support those who have lost everything by putting a gold coin or two in the buckets that will be passed around during the show.

"All funds raised will go to the Prime Minister's Relief and Rehabilitation Fund."

The concert will be held at Sukuna Park in Suva from 10am to midnight.

Serevi said the show was made possible through the kind support of the Suva City Council, Digicel, Stage Tech, Grand Pacific Hotel and Fiji Performing Rights Association.
