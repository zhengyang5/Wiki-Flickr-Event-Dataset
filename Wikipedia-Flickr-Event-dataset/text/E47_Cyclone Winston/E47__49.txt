DIGICEL has pledged $150,000 towards the Prime Minister's Relief Fund for those affected by Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston.

CEO Darren McLean said a further $50,000 would be directed to the National Disaster Management Office to help reach the most vulnerable and affected.

"In times of natural disasters, we think it is important that we move quickly to help the most vulnerable in our communities," Mr McLean said.

"There has been a huge amount of damage in the northwest of Viti Levu, Koro, Lomaiviti Group and up in the North.

"I have seen the situation first-hand while surveying the damage to our towers yesterday (Monday)."

Mr McLean called on other organisations to offer assistance in any way they can to help in the rebuilding of the nation.

"Digicel is proud to be part of a community that is coming together in this time of need to support the relief and rehabilitation efforts and would urge more organisations to come forward and help out.

"Digicel wishes all families in Fiji a peaceful and safe recovery."
