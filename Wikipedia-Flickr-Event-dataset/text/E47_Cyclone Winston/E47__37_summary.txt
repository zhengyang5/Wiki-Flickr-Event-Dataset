Far north Queensland coast braces for ex-Tropical Cyclone Winston, could bring up to 300mm of rainUpdatedParts of the Queensland coast between Cairns and Townsville could cop up to 300 millimetres of rain within 24 hours, thanks to a low associated with ex-Tropical Cyclone Winston.
It prompted the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to issue a severe weather warning, which predicted areas of heavy rain that could lead to flash flooding.
The weather warning has prompted Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (QFES) to deploy additional swift water rescue crews to north Queensland ahead of time.
"We've also got crews as far down as Bowen as well," he said.
We're not expecting the rain to go that far but we have pre-positioned crews just in case."
