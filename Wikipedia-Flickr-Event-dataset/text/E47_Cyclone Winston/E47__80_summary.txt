Today I announce that Australia will provide additional assistance to Fiji as it responds to the devastation caused by Tropical Cyclone Winston.
This contribution builds on earlier assistance which delivered lifesaving support to people across the country within 48 hours of the cyclone.
The Australian Government will also provide further support to respond to urgent health needs of the Fijian people.
This new package of support brings the Australian Governmentâ€™s assistance for Fiji to $15 million.
Australia is the largest contributor to the international relief effort, and we stand ready to provide further assistance to support the people of Fiji should it be required.
