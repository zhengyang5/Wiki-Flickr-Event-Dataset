THE Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide $US2million ($F4.21m) in emergency assistance to help the Government and people of Fiji to cope with and recover from the damage caused by Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston.

"I offer my deepest condolences to the people of Fiji for the devastation caused by Severe TC Winston, and my sincere sympathies to those who have lost their loved ones, homes, and livelihoods," said ADB president Takehiko Nakao in a statement.

Mr Nakao pledged ADB's full support to Fiji, both in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and in its subsequent recovery.

The emergency assistance will be mobilised from ADB's Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund.

ADB will work with Government and development partners to identify priority relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction needs.

The bank's vice-president, Stephen Groff, will be in Fiji on tomorrow to sign the grant agreements with the Government.

Severe TC Winston has been the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the southern hemisphere with sustained winds of about 230kilometres per hour and gusts of 325km per hour.

The cyclone made landfall on the main island of Viti Levu on Saturday evening, leaving about 42 people dead and causing extensive damage to critical infrastructure and livelihoods.

The Fijian Government declared a state of emergency for 30 days as relief workers assess the damage caused by Severe TC Winston.

Initial estimates indicate that as many as 8000 people have had to leave their homes and are now residing evacuation centers.

ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.
