Foreign AffairsForeign Minister Murray McCully has outlined the initial support that New Zealand will provide to Fiji as they respond to Tropical Cyclone Winston.
“Tropical Cyclone Winston appears to have caused major damage on the Northern Coast of Vitu Levu and sadly one person has now been confirmed dead,” Mr McCully says.
“New Zealand stands ready to assist the people of Fiji as they deal with the aftermath of Cyclone Winston and we are in close contact with the Government of Fiji.
“A New Zealand Defence Force Orion P3 has just departed Whenuapai to help the Fiji authorities carry out aerial surveillance and damage assessments.
New Zealanders with concerns about friends and family in Fiji should attempt to make contact directly in the first instance (noting that communication lines may be down in parts of Northern Fiji).
