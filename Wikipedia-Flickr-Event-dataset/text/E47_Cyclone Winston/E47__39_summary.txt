This was confirmed to FBC News by Education Minister Dr Mahendra Reddy saying this will allow parents and students to prepare for school after Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston damaged many schools and homes.
“Will allow the management as well to do the clean-up and prepare the school.
We will also ensure that we don’t lose any teaching time so the term one break that is supposed to be for two weeks will now be for one week because we are pulling one week from next week that is tomorrow.
