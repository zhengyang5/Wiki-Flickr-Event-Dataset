The European Union (EU) will provide an initial FJ$ 10 million through the Pacific Community (SPC) to complement the Fijian Government's efforts in relief, recovery and rehabilitation following the devastation caused by Tropical Cyclone Winston.
The funds will immediately be made available from EU-SPC projects for communities and businesses in the most severely affected regions of Fiji.
"The FJ$10M is a direct, practical short term response to the needs of Fijian citizens in the affected areas", says EU Ambassador for the Pacific Andrew Jacobs.
Support will be targeted to the needs on all levels of the agriculture value chain, including farmers, agri-processing and export companies.
In addition, projects will also fast-track resources towards the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and rural electricity needs of affected citizens.
