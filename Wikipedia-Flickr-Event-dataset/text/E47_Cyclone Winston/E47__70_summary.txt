Direct Relief’s emergency personnel are in Fiji, where an estimated 50,000 persons remain homeless in shelters following Cyclone Winston, which devastated parts of the country last weekend.
Direct Relief’s response began as the storm approached Fiji and has accelerated in its aftermath as the extent of damage has become clearer.
Fijian authorities have requested large quantities of medicines, IV solutions, and emergency medical modules that Direct Relief began delivering last week to help hospitals and health facilities extend care in the emergency’s aftermath.
Combined with the emergency aid delivered last week FedEx (free-of-charge), Direct Relief’s will have provided nearly $525,000 worth of medicines and supplies to Fiji in response to Cyclone Winston.
Since 2009, Direct Relief has provided $27.3 million worth of medicines, supplies, and equipment to the Ministry of Health, hospitals, and other partners in Fiji.
