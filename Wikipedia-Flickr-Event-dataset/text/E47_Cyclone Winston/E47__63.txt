The Republic of Indonesia Defense Force will rebuild Queen Victoria School.

This has been confirmed by the Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama while handing over some assistance to the people in Silana village in Dawasamu today.

Bainimarama said the Republic of Indonesia offered to rebuild QVS and fund the whole reconstruction.

The Republic of Indonesia donated $10.38 million to the Prime Ministerâ€™s Relief and Rehabilitation Fund yesterday.

Bainimarama said the government is overwhelmed by the help from other countries who volunteered to rebuild the schools that have been damaged by Tropical Cyclone Winston.

He added that other big companies in the country have come forward to help rebuild the schools.

The Prime Minister is urging parents and students to be patient with the rebuilding of the schools as the RFMF engineers and other contractors are doing their best.

Meanwhile, Bainimarama said it will take time to build homes that have been destroyed by Cyclone Winston.

This comment comes after people in Silana village, Dawasamu, questioned him on when the rebuilding of their homes will begin.

Bainimarama said they have a group of engineers assessing different types of homes in different areas around the country and they have had construction companies giving in their suggestions on the type of homes to be built.

He added that they must look after the welfare of the people who were affected by the cyclone.

Bainimarama said more than 30,000 houses were damaged by Cyclone Winston.
