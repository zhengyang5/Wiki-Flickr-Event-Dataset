Far north Queensland coast embraces long awaited rainfall as ex-TC Winston makes landfallPostedResidents of far north Queensland's Cassowary Coast have welcomed long-awaited rainfall in the region as the remains of ex-Tropical Cyclone Winston pass overhead.
Feluga resident Linda Brescansin lives on a tributary of Bulgun Creek, which recorded 215 millimetres of rain in the 24 hours prior to 9.00am Friday.
"The creeks are a bit swollen, not too bad, but I think they've remained steady for about the last 12 hours," Ms Brescansin said.
She said it was not uncommon for the creeks to break their banks, but ex-Tropical Cyclone Winston had not yet had as big an impact as some might have expected.
Rainfall in the tropics: 'we love it'As residents of what is arguably Australia's wettest region, both women played down reports that people in far north Queensland were bracing for the rainfall associated with ex-Tropical Cyclone Winston.
