Cyclones rarely take many lives across the South Pacific, but the modest population of South Pacific islands means that even a relatively small death toll can have a major impact.
Several South Pacific cyclones since 1980 are known to have taken more lives than the confirmed total from Winston.

While many cyclones in the South Pacific have caused severe devastation, the roughly half-billion-dollar cost of Winston appears to be a record-setter for this region.
The previous most costly cyclone in the South Pacific was just last year, when Category 5 Tropical Cyclone Pam tore through Vanuatu, causing $360 million in damage.
