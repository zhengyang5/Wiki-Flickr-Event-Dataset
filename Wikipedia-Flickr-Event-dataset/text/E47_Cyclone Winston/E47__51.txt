GOVERNMENT will be paying a whopping $19.9million to 43,624 families living under the Ministry of Social Welfare's Poverty Benefit Scheme and Care and Protection Allowance on Friday next week.

The major announcement was made by Finance Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum yesterday who said the payments for the next three months would be made in a lump sum to assist those who had been catastrophically affected by the wrath of Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston. Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said under the first category — the poverty benefit scheme — 23,035 households would get a $200 top up, and be paid a lump sum of $600 to cover for the next three months.

In the second category, he said 3257 families under the care and protection allowance would receive an additional $100 for the next three months.

This will be paid in a lump sum of $300.

Mr Sayed-Khaiyum also announced that 17,332 pensioners over the age of 68 who are currently receiving a monthly payment of $50 will be paid an additional amount of $100. The lump sum of $300 will be paid to them next Friday.

He also outlined that while the beneficiaries of the assistance would continue to receive their normal monthly allowance from the ministry, the lump sum payments should not be misused.

Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said the money should not be used for grog and cigarettes.

"We ask people to use this money wisely. This money has been given to you and your children for basic necessities. We have heard of some abuse of people who have received a lot of assistance from NGOs and Government. Please use this responsibly because a lot of people in Fiji need this assistance.

"Because the reality is that many homes in Fiji have been hit very adversely, some of them catastrophically, and they do need assistance." He said the assistance was guided and focused on individuals and families and would be of great help for them.
