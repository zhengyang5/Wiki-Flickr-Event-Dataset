Wild surf whipped up by ex-Tropical Cyclone Winston has inflicted dislocated shoulders, broken bones and other serious injuries, leading to the closure of all Gold Coast and most Sunshine Coast beaches.
As four-metre swell continued to pound the coast today, SLSQ announced that Gold Coast beaches will remain closed tomorrow.
The continuing "powerful and dangerous surf conditions" prompted the decision, SLSQ Gold Coast coordinator Nathan Fife said.
(AAP)"There are strong rips and gutters all across the Gold Coast, along with large swells and powerful waves."
Kirra Beach was closed yesterday, and all Gold Coast beaches will remain closed until at least Monday.
