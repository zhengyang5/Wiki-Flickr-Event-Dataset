Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced a $1.5 million increase to New Zealand’s aid package to Fiji as it recovers from Cyclone Winston.
The announcement comes following Minister McCully’s visit to Fiji yesterday and takes New Zealand’s total support to over $4.7 million.
“The devastation caused by Cyclone Winston is very serious.
Nearly 55,000 people remain in evacuation centres and the people of Fiji now face the difficult task of rebuilding their lives,” Mr McCully says.
“New Zealand will support the Fiji Government as it works to recover from Cyclone Winston and we are currently developing a wider package of support focused on helping affected communities rebuild,” Mr McCully says.
