The Fijian Government is still trying to contact areas that haven’t been heard from since being struck by Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston on the weekend.
Oxfam in the Pacific Regional Director Raijeli Nicole said communication blackspots were making it very hard to assess damage and determine the scale of the response required.
“The Fijians are desperately trying to repair severed lines of communication, but they hold grave fears that the news waiting for them will be dire,” Ms Nicole said.
“People seem to have heeded the warnings from the government to prepare themselves and stayed indoors, or in government organised evacuation centres, so we hope this will have kept casualties as low as possible,” Ms Nicole said.
As the scale of devastation becomes more apparent, Oxfam may deploy more staff should assistance be required.
