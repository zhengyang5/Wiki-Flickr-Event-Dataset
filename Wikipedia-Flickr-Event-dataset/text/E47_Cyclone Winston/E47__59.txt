THE Korean Government has joined other countries in assisting people affected by Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston with a contribution of $107,000.

Korean ambassador Kim Seong-In presented the contribution to Minister for Foreign Affairs Ratu Inoke Kubuabola yesterday.

Ratu Inoke thanked the Korean Government for their gift that would go a long way in alleviating some of the trauma faced by affected families.

According to a Government statement, the funds would go towards the Prime Minister's National Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation Fund.

The Korean ambassador was also accompanied by a delegation of maritime and energy research specialists working with Korean International Co-operation Agency (KOICA).

They discussed Ratu Inoke's recommendation to consider feasibility studies by development partners on the potential of geothermal energy production in Fiji. Ratu Inoke suggested it was an opportune time to revisit some of the ideas for geothermal energy production especially in light of the damage caused by Severe TC Winston.
