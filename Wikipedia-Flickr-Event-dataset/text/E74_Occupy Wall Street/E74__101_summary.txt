Zuccotti Park Owners: Sanitation Becoming A Problem, Quit Hogging The Place October 6, 2011 9:34 PMNEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly had some strong words for “Occupy Wall Street” protesters Thursday, blaming participants for starting skirmishes which led to more than 20 arrests on Wednesday.
They wanted to get into Wall Street, they wanted to occupy Wall Street,” Kelly told reporters.
The commissioner told reporters that the protests have cost the city about $2 million in overtime for officers assigned to cover the demonstrations.
Despite the clashes and arrests, Kelly stressed that as long as protesters followed the rules, there would be no issues.
The problem for the city and the police is even if they wanted to, they can’t evict “Occupy Wall Street” as long as they make Zuccotti Park their headquarters.
