Occupy Wall Street members gather at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine to march during a candlelight vigil to honor Rev.
Critics say the Occupy movement lacks demands and direction and has lost momentum.
"The success of the movement has never depended on money," Occupy Wall Street spokesman Ed Needham said.
Since Occupy Wall Street began it has received more than $730,000 in donations, according to the accounting group.
Christine Crowther, of the Occupy Wall Street Accounting group, said the bail fund would allow them to keep taking to the streets to protest.
