Thanks to the Occupy movement and information easily disseminated on the Internet, Americans are better informed about the rich-poor gap.
Case in point: The hoopla over Mitt Romney's tax return.
The original survey question asked respondents: “In America, how much conflict is there between poor people and rich people?”Their responses shouldn’t be surprising.
Under quizzing by the press, Mr. Romney has admitted that he pays an effective tax rate of about 15 percent.
But history suggests a huge rich-poor gap can be a factor leading to political discontent and worse.
