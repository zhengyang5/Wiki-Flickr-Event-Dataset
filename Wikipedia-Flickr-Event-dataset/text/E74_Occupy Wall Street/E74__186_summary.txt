New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he disagrees with the Occupy Wall Street protesters on who deserves the blame for ordinary Americans' economic woes.
But, when it comes to who's responsible for that "corrosive power", Capital New York reports Bloomberg said he believes the blame rests in Washington.
It was not the banks that created the mortgage crisis.
Back on Columbus Day, he noted that as long as the movement stayed within the city's laws, protesters could stay indefinitely.
And as long as they obey the laws, we'll allow them to," Bloomberg told the Wall Street Journal.
