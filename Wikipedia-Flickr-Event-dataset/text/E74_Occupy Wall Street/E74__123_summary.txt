An Occupy Wall Street kitchen worker has been charged with groping one female demonstrator -- and is a suspect in the horrifying rape of another, law-enforcement sources told The Post.
The creeped-out victim told cops that Iketubosin offered to help her put up her tent -- and was still inside when she showed up to go to sleep hours later, according to the sources.
The enraged protester told cops she was finally able to shove him out of the tent.
The woman told cops about the pervy protester on Tuesday.
She went to sleep in the tent only to find the pervert trying to peel off her pants, the sources said.
