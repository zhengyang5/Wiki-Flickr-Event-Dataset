Cecily McMillan, the Occupy Wall Street activist who was imprisoned for assaulting a police officer, was released on Wednesday after spending eight weeks at New York’s Rikers Island jail.
"I am inspired by the resilient community I have encountered in a system that is stacked against us," she said.
McMillan has previously said that she was placed in a barracks-like room with almost 100 other women.
She also said that she suffered bruising and a seizure after being wrestled to the ground during her arrest.
On the day of her conviction in May, she told the Guardian that she was “done” with New York.
