We greet the Occupy Wall St. movement as it spreads throughout our country from large cities to small towns, led by youth and joined by people of all ages and backgrounds, giving voice to deep anger at extreme economic inequality.
An epic battle is underway for the direction of our country.
The Occupy movement is not alone.
We stand with the courageous young people who have sparked this movement and join with the occupiers who are putting themselves on the line to transform our nation and achieve a secure and sustainable future.
We stand with all those fighting racism and all forms of bigotry which is being used by right wing opposition to confuse, divide and defeat this historic movement.
