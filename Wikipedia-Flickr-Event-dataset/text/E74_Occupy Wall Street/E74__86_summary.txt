Donations to the group have slowed six months after it set up camp in a park near Wall Street, igniting the Occupy movement across the United States.
Since Occupy Wall Street began, it has received more than $730,000 in donations, according to the accounting group.
But Occupy Wall Street spokesman Ed Needham said, "The success of the movement has never depended on money."
Occupy Wall Street protesters have been scattered across New York since their camp was evicted from Zuccotti Park in November.
Occupy Wall Street has also appealed online for more people to "host an occupier in your home and help sustain the movement."
