So the question now is how far Occupy Wall Street has slipped out of sight and what has taken its place.
Clinically speaking, the Occupy movement is far from deceased, with meetings and protests still happening all over the country.
“Many of the early participants in the large assemblies in New York last summer, which organized to Occupy Wall Street on Sept. 17, never wanted to build a movement per se,” Salon’s Natasha Lennard wrote recently.
The last NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on the movement in April showed that 25% of Americans had a positive view of Occupy Wall Street, while 37% had a negative view, numbers that put Occupy roughly on par with the tea party (27% positive/38% negative).
“Activism that becomes infatuated with the culture its performance creates is just exhibitionism,” wrote Kelly Roberts in a March blog post called “How Occupy Wall Street Loved Itself to Death."
