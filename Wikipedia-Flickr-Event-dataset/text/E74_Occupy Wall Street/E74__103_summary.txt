Oct. 14 (Bloomberg) -- A confrontation between Occupy Wall Street demonstrators and New York City police was avoided after Brookfield Office Properties Inc. postponed cleaning its Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, where the protesters have camping out for almost a month.
Demonstrators formed cleanup crews that swept and mopped through the night as crowds gathered ahead of the owner’s planned move.
More than 3,000 people had gathered at the site, according to an e-mail from Patrick Bruner, an Occupy Wall Street spokesman.
