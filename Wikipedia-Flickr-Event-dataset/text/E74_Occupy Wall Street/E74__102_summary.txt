Major problems have not been resolved and large questions remain: Will the protesters be able to bring their sleeping bags back into Liberty Park?
A young man named Jesse told me about his experience going to prison during the Occupy Boston mass arrests.
The protesters will not surrender Liberty without a fight, and have only planned to escalate demonstrations during the next few days.
I do find it curious that the establishment media haven’t raised more eyebrows over the fact that the mayor’s live-in girlfriend, Diana Taylor, sits on the board that owns Liberty Park.
But at least for one more night, Liberty Park belongs to OWS, and not a single person who was there will forget what it felt like to win a battle.
