The challenge Occupy Wall Street offers to Washington politics has caught media observers by surprise.
But it is a mistake to think Occupy Wall Street is without historical roots.
More than three decades later, in the early years of the Great Depression, a group of World War I vets, the Bonus Marchers, adopted a similar strategy.
The Bonus Army was unsuccessful in 1932.
It was the start of a new day for the vets, and in 1936 Congress at last voted them their bonus.
