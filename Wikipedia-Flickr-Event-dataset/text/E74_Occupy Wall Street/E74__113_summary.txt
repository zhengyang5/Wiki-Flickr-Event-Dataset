Occupy Wall Street protests last year cost the city a whopping $17 million in overtime pay to cops, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly revealed Thursday.
During the City Council’s annual budget hearing, Kelly said the department expects to pay a total of about $585 million in police overtime this fiscal year, $34 million more than last year.
Kelly said the NYPD tried to find ways to reduce the cost of policing the protests, but the events were simply too unpredictable.
“The unplanned events are always the wild card,” Kelly said.
