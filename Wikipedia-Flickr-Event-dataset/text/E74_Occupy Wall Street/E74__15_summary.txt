Now Occupy Wall Street is much larger than its initial small group of organizers.
None of them had any idea what would happen on day one of Occupy Wall Street -- or how the rest of the country and the world would react.
"There is a straight line from Bloombergville to Occupy Wall Street," says Justin Wedes, a 25-year-old part-time teacher who took part in Bloombergville.
"On September 17, we want to see 20,000 people flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months."
Seizing on the call to Occupy Wall Street, New Yorkers Against Budget Cuts sent out an email to its allies.
