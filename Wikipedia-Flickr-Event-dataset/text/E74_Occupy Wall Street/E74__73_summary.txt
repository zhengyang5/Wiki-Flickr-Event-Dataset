According to a new study from sociologists at the City University of New York, more than a third of activists in the Occupy movement in New York City had household incomes above $100,000, placing them at the cusp of the top quintile of income distribution in America.
Non-Hispanic whites constituted 62 percent of all respondents, though they make up only 33 percent of New York City residents.
Among college graduates, more than a quarter went to top-ranked schools, which might help explain why the majority of graduates under 30 had some student debt.
While 10 percent of participants were unemployed, 71 percent were employed in professional occupations.
The protests were largely organized by a core group of experienced activists who were “disproportionately white and male,” according to the researchers.
