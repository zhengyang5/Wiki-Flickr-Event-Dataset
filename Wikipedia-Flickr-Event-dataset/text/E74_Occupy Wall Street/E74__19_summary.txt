Occupy Wall Street protesters have set up an urban campground.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Many of the Occupy Wall Street protesters might not realize it, but they got really lucky when they elected to gather at Zuccotti Park in downtown Manhattan.
So Occupy Wall Street ended up at nearby Zuccotti Park, another large, open space that even boasts power outlets for a crowd that's very wired.
Brookfield, the NYPD and the office of Mayor Bloomberg have all declined to comment on exactly how things at Zuccotti Park are being handled.
And it's obvious that Occupy Wall Street is violating most if not all of those rules by turning the spot into a sort of urban campground.
