A Brooklyn man has been arrested for groping a protester at Zuccotti Park â€” and he could be linked to a similar sex crime at the Occupy Wall Street encampment, police sources said Wednesday.
Tonye Iketubosin, 26, was collared after the 18-year-old victim, who claimed the creep sexually assaulted her a few days earlier, spotted him lurking near the encampment Tuesday night, police and witnesses said.
Iketubosin tried to enter the park, but protesters joined forces to bar him from getting inside, witnesses told the Daily News.
