Did Russia fake black activism on Facebook to sow division in the US?
We are witnessing the advent of social movement warfare: the deployment of social protest as an effective alternative to conventional military conflict.
In fact, although it is rarely discussed, the Occupy movement received substantial support from Russia.
These were all obvious attempts to co-opt our social protest by amplifying it and becoming the movementâ€™s primary mouthpiece and media source.
Russia never tried, as far as we know, to splinter off a fake Occupy frontgroup.
