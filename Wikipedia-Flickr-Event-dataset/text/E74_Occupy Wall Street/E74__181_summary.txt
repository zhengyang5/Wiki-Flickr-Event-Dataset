The Occupy "movement" (and I use that term generously) has spiraled into irrelevance and relative obscurity.
The "Occupy" Factor: Successful protest movements aren't about occupation, per se.
Successful protest movements aren't about camping out, book sharing, eating, and "talking to each other," as one organizer told me.
No Leadership: Every successful protest movement needs a leader; a strong, passionate, articulate, visible face and voice of the movement.
In an election year as significant as this one, the Occupy movement is as good as dead.
