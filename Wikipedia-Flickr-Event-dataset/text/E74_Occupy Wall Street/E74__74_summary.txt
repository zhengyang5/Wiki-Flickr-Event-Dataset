The Occupy Wall Street movement captured public attention while speaking for the so-called 99 percent, but those who actively participated were drawn from a much narrower, more elite slice of American society, according to a new survey.
“When people are saying, ‘Occupy Wall Street is a white, middle-class thing,’ I can’t really fight them because it’s not true, but then, it’s not necessarily false either,” Michele Crentsil, a 23-year-old African-American Occupy participant said in the report.
Only 5.4 percent of actively involved participants said they joined Occupy Wall Street to deal with racism or race-related issues, while 19 percent cited student debt and access to education, according to the report.
Occupy Wall Street’s largely white, highly-educated makeup also affected the way the movement was organized, the report said.
And though the movement had no official leaders, those who represented Occupy Wall Street in the public sphere were often white, male and highly educated, one protester interviewed for the report noted.
