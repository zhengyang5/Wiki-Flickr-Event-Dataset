Wall Street is fattening its paychecks even as it slashes jobs.
The New York financial sector has been cutting employees in recent years.
Their pay was close to pre-recession highs in 2007, according to a report from the New York State comptroller.
The average salary of financial industry employees in New York City rose to $362,950 in 2011.
The likelihood of Wall Street pay falling looks slim.
