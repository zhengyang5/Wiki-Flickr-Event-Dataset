The department spent $2 million on overtime during the movement’s first three weeks alone.
The mayor’s preliminary budget plan released last month sets aside $6 million to cover expenses related to the protests, Kelly said.
"I don't have that number," Kelly said, adding that most of the intelligence the NYPD gathered about Occupy Wall Street came from the Internet.
