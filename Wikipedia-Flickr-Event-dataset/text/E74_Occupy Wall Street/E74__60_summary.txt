Since the end of the 20th century loud calls for reinstating the rule of the people in liberal democracies have been heard, particularly in but not limited to alter-globalization circles devoted to creating another world.
This trend has been strengthened in the passage to the 21st century and this article traces the influences behind it, as well as the motivations and ways in which representative democracy is rejected by activists in favor of a new system that fulfills what is perceived as the original promise of democracy to bring power to all the people.
The article concludes with a discussion on the consequences of a re-energized notion and practice of “rule by the demos” to liberal democracy.
