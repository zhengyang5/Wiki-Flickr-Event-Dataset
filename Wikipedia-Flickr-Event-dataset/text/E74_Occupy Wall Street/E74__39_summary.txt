Share this:"Occupy Wall Street’s Success: Even Republicans Are Talking About Income Inequality" Share:As ThinkProgress’ Zaid Jilani cataloged earlier this month, the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations have helped shift media coverage away from conservative concerns about the federal debt and deficit to the more progressive (and important) issues of unemployment and unequal income distribution.
Now, the 99 Percent Movement’s influence on the wider political landscape is becoming clear.
[...] So rather than ignore the disparity — and risk looking out of touch — Republicans are acknowledging income inequality.
The move is rather remarkable for GOP lawmakers, who have previously tried to completely disqualify the Occupy protests and stamp out any discussion of wealth distribution or equity as “class warfare” or socialistic.
While critics deride the Occupy Wall Street protests for lacking clear policy goals or accomplishments, if the movement accomplishes nothing beyond fundamentally shifting the political discourse away from trumped up fears about the debt to real issues like inequality and jobs, then it has already succeeded.
