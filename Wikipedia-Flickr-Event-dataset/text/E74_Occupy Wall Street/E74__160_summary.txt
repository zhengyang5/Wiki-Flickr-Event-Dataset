Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesAs Occupy Wall Street spread across the nation last fall, sparking protests in more than 70 cities, the Department of Homeland Security began keeping tabs on the movement.
An internal DHS report entitled “SPECIAL COVERAGE: Occupy Wall Street," dated October of last year, opens with the observation that "mass gatherings associated with public protest movements can have disruptive effects on transportation, commercial, and government services, especially when staged in major metropolitan areas."
"Social media and the organic emergence of online communities," the report notes, "have driven the rapid expansion of the OWS movement."
As the primary target of the demonstrations, financial services stands the sector most impacted by the OWS protests.
What’s more, there have been reports that Homeland Security played an active role in coordinating the nationwide crackdown on the Occupy movement last November – putting the federal government in the position of targeting its own citizens in the name of national security.
