700 arrested on Brooklyn Bridge after protestNEW YORK (AP) Â— Protesters speaking out against corporate greed and other grievances were maintaining a presence in Manhattan's Financial District even after more than 700 of them were arrested during a march on the Brooklyn Bridge in a tense confrontation with police.
During Saturday's march on the Brooklyn Bridge, some protesters sat on the roadway, chanting "Let us go," while others chanted and yelled at police from the pedestrian walkaway above.
"We were supposed to go up the pedestrian roadway," said Robert Cammiso, a 48-year-old student from Brooklyn told the Daily News.
Earlier Saturday, thousands who joined two other marches crossed the Brooklyn Bridge without problems.
Occupy Wall Street demonstrators have been camped in Zuccotti Park and have clashed with police on earlier occasions.
