Protests inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York and the "Indignants" in Spain have spread to cities around the world.
Dave Bonan, who was at Occupy Wall Street on the first day of the protest a month ago, said it was "a little surreal" that the protest had spread.
A group of 100 prominent authors including Salman Rushdie, Neil Gaiman and Pulitzer prize-winning novelists Jennifer Egan and Michael Cunningham signed an online petition declaring their support for "Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement around the world".
Ethan McGarry, 18, who had travelled to New York from Boston for the day, said it was "fantastic" how the occupy movement had spread.
Lauren Zygmont had travelled from the Occupy Denver protest to New York a week ago ago.
