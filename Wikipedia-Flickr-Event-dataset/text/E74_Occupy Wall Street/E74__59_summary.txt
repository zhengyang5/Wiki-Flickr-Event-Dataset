In brief remarks to the occupiers at Liberty Plaza, Butler offered her take on the continuing “demands” debate:People have asked, so what are the demands?
Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands.
And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical.
If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible — that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible.
