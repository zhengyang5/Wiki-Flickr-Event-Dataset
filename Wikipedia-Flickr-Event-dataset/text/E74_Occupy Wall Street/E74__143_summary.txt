A majority of the jurors who this week convicted an Occupy Wall Street activist of assaulting a New York police officer have asked the judge in her case to not send her to prison.
Cecily McMillan was on Monday found guilty of deliberately elbowing officer Grantley Bovell in the face, as he led her out of a protest in March 2012.
She was convicted of second-degree assault, a felony, and faces up to seven years in prison.
“We the jury petition the court for leniency in the sentencing of Cecily McMillan,” they wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian.
Nine of the 12 jurors who found Cecily McMillan guilty of deliberately elbowing a police officer have written to the judge in the case.
