The Occupy Wall Street protest is now in its third week and continuing to grow.
A large group continues to camp out in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, near Wall Street, and supporters have launched satellite protests across the country, from Boston to Los Angeles .
There might not be these kinds of public leaders, but there are people running it, and I think that's inevitable.
IBTimes: Both Occupy Wall Street and the Egyptian movement call(ed) for broad, long-term social change, but unlike Occupy Wall Street, the Egyptian protests had a specific short-term goal: to force Mubarak to step down.
While Occupy Wall Street has a number of specific criticisms, it doesn't have a concrete short-term goal like that.
