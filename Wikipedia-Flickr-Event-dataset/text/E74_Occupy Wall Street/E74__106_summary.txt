Infuriated lower Manhattan residents went ballistic on Zuccotti Park protesters at a chaotic Community Board 1 meeting tonight while blasting politicians for allowing the siege to continue without any end in sight.
"The protesters taunt people who are on their way to work," said James Fernandez, 51, whose apartment overlooks the park.
If people can't sleep and children can't sleep because the protesters are banging drums then that's a problem."
"They have to have some parameters," said Tricia Joyce, also a board member.
The line to get into the standing room only meeting spilled out of the board's office and onto the street outside where Zuccotti sympathizers sparred with angry residents.
