A trial that had become a rallying point for many Occupy Wall Street activists ended on Monday with a jury finding a protester guilty of assaulting a police officer at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan in 2012.
Ms. McMillan had said she could not distinctly recall what happened amid the chaos of the night.
Ms. McMillan was arrested on March 17, 2012, the night hundreds of people gathered to observe the founding of the Occupy Wall Street movement six months earlier.
Ms. McMillan was one of the few people arrested during the Occupy Wall Street protests who opted for a trial.
Mr. Vance obtained indictments against seven Occupy Wall Street protesters in 2011 and 2012 on charges of assaulting police officers.
