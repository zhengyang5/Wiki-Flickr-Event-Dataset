Occupy Wall Street shot to popularity back in December 2011 by people fed up with corporate greed and the fallout from the global financial crisis.
Supporters say the focus on Occupy Wall Street has faded because it achieved its goals.
And they point to protest movements that Occupy no doubt inspired in Egypt, Hong Kong, and around the world.
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll found:“By a greater than 2-to-1 margin, however, Americans said they’re less worried about the income gap, per se, and more worried about how middle- or working-class Americans can get ahead financially.
In other words, although the Occupy protestors have moved on, things unfortunately haven’t changed much at all.
