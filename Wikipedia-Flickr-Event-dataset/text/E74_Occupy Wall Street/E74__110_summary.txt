NEW YORK (AP) -- It was only a few nights after the Occupy protesters began sleeping in his church sanctuary when Pastor Bob Brashears realized that his laptop was missing.
This is what the Occupy encampment has become: A band of homeless protesters with no place to go.
On Monday, the metal barricades surrounding Zuccotti Park were removed for the first time since the November raid.
The debate over providing food and shelter for the church Occupiers plays into a larger one that has divided New York's protesters ever since the police raid.
Brashears hasn't yet decided whether he will allow the protesters to stay at West-Park beyond next week.
