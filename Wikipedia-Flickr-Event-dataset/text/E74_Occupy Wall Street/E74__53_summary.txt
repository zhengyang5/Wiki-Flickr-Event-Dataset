Last weekend “Occupy Wall Street” extended its roots around the globe.
More than 5,000 protestors gathered in Frankfurt outside the headquarters of the European Central Bank.
In Germany, while they are based on the same movement, the protests hit a slightly different note.
“It is against the banks, it is against financial powers in the system, it is about profits being before people,” said Wolfram Siener, a speaker for “Occupy Frankfurt” in Berlin’s Der Tagesspiegel.
It is uncertain how long protests like “Occupy Wall Street” will last.
