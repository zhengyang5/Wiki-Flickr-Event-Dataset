It's no wonder people are angry at Wall Street.
And that, in a nutshell, is why the Occupy Wall Street movement isn't going away.
It makes sense there is a crowd of angry protesters "occupying" Wall Street and other locations around the world.
Now some are trying to brand the Occupy Wall Street group as anti-capitalist.
I don't have a problem with the concept of anybody earning big bucks on Wall Street.
