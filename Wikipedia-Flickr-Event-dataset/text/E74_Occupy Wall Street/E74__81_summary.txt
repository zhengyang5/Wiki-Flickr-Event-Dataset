Like a lot of wealthy Wall Street-connected 52-year-olds, Halper gave the maximum contribution of $2,500 to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.
But this guy also wrote a $20,000 check to help launch Occupy Wall Street.
Halper, a one-percenter who made his fortune as a Wall Street trader, happens to be one of the largest donors to the anti-corporate magazine Adbusters.
(The Times writes that the Brooklyn-born Halper "was first attracted by the magazine's spoofs on corporate logos and advertisements.")
It's not odd for a guy who made his money in finance to spend money on causes hoping to curb the industry's worst abuses.
