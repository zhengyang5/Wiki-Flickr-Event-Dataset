"Occupy Wall Street" is readying its protesters to camp in on Wall Street starting Saturday, for as long as their passion lasts.
Occupy Wall Street, a leaderless resistance movement, was published by activist magazine Adbusters on July 13, and since then people from groups such as NYC General Assembly and US Day of Rage have participated to organize the event.
"On the 17th of September, we want to see 20,000 people to flood into lower Manhattan, set up beds, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months," states the website.

Occupy Wall Street protesters will gather at the iconic bull of the Wall Street in Bowling Green Park at 12 p.m. on Saturday, followed by a "General Assembly" at 3 p.m. at One Chase Manhattan Plaza.
