The sudden emergence of America's Tea Party movement in 2007 is a good example.
Although the global Occupy movement has branched out in an open-source way, many of its participants and spectators might be completely unaware of who actually launched it.
The original call for Occupy Wall Street came from non-profit international media foundation Adbusters.
There are also reports of Canvas activity during the early days of Occupy Wall Street, including a video of Marovic himself addressing the general assembly.
In the end, the Occupy movement could easily end up doing the bidding of the very elite globalist powers that they were demonstrating against to begin with.
