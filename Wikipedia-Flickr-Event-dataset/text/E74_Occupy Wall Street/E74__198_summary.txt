Groups within the Occupy Wall Street movement are trying to overhaul the banking system and even dream of creating a new kind of bank.
One of the facilitators of the Occupy Bank Working Group is former British diplomat Carne Ross.
A couple of times a week, Occupy Wall Street has a Spokes Council where decisions are made by consensus.
A Democratic BankRoss makes a presentation about how this new bank, if it existed, would fulfill the values and ideals of Occupy Wall Street.
The Occupy Bank Working Group is inspired by innovative financial institutions like the ShoreBank.
