Late Wednesday night, just as groups of Occupy Wall Street protesters were launching efforts to invade Wall Street, a middle-aged black man stopped and stuck a sign in the wrought iron gate that surrounds a Lower Manhattan church, and then scurried away.
It spoke to the protest movement itself: DECOLONIZE WALL STREET â€“ stand up for more BLACK + BROWN LEADERS in this MOVEMENT.
Today, there are many protesters who blame Wall Street for the country's current economic state -- and the recession's unequal impact.
Occupy Wall Street organizers did not respond to a request for comment about their efforts by deadline.
The Occupy Wall Street movement got its start with an ad in an alternative publication called Adbusters.
