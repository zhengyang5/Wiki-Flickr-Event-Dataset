AmericaOccupy Wall Street Doesn't Endorse Philly ConferenceOccupy Wall Street tells The Associated Press that a national conference being planned in Philadelphia this summer was not approved by its General Assembly, meaning the group does not endorse it.
The AP reports:"Han Shan, a member of the Occupy Wall Street public relations working group, said Thursday that the conference was mainly Pollok's idea and that, while Occupy Wall Street may support some of its ideas, the group isn't endorsing the conference itself.
"The Occupy Wall Street movement began in New York City and spread across the country, with protesters denouncing corporate excess and economic inequality."
"The group's plans blatantly contradict OWS' Statement of Autonomy, as passed by the General Assembly at Occupy Wall Street," the statement reads.
But also says that any statement released outside of the movement's official website, "should be considered independent of Occupy Wall Street."
