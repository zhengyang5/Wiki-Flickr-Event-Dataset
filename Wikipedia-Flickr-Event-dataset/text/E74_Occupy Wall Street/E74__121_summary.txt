Protesters at Zuccotti Park.
advertisementA man has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a paramedic and breaking his leg at the Occupy Wall Street site overnight.
Police say paramedics were called to Zuccotti Park for a man who was acting irrationally.
But authorities say protesters formed a human chain to block the police as the man refused to go.
"This isn't an occupation of Wall Street," he said at the time, "it's the occupation of a growing, vibrant, residential neighborhood in Lower Manhattan and it's really hurting small businesses and families."
