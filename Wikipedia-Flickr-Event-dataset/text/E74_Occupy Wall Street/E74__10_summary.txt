Over the course of a year of being immersed in Occupy Wall Street, I saw a veil being lifted.
With artists mainly in charge, Occupy Wall Street was art before it was anything properly organized, before it was even politics.
Even after General Assembly ends I find myself being very attentive in situations where I’m not normally so attentive.
“Maybe the General Assembly has been the really big central planner, but I don’t know,” Drew Hornbein told me that week over lunch.
I told her I had been up at Chase Manhattan Plaza, north of Wall Street, and it was also completely closed off.
