New York firefighters removed about a dozen gasoline cans and six generators from Zuccotti Park, where Occupy Wall Street protesters have camped for almost six weeks, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.
The equipment, which helped power computers and mobile phones and keep people warm as temperatures dipped near freezing, are safety hazards and illegal, Bloomberg said.
“Our first two concerns are First Amendment and safety, and this was safety,” Bloomberg said.
Occupiers have vowed to remain at the site near the World Trade Center even as temperatures plummet.
Today, police arrested Dustin Taylor, 34, of Wheelersburg, Ohio, near Zuccotti Park and charged him with menacing after he threatened to stab a Fox 5 reporter in the throat with a pen, said Paul Browne, a department spokesman.
