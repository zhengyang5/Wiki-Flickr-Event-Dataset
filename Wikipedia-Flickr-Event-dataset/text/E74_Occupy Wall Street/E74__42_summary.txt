Still, I tried the New York City Parks Department.
The police department didn't return a phone call and email asking about the rules governing Zuccotti Park.
New York, of course, has a long history of public authorities like the the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center.
Such entities are responsible for the way much of New York City and its environs were built.
It's happening with Manhattan's Highline park and Battery Park City, and Brooklyn's Brooklyn Bridge Park.
