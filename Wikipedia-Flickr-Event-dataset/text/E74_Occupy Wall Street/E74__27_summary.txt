Ed Needham, an Occupy Wall Street media spokesman, said the reaction from people who had read the statement at the protest was "terrific".
Alexander Penley, who has been involved in Occupy Wall Street since the protest began on 17 September, said it was "wonderful" to receive the message.
Occupy Wall Street began after a call for action by Canadian activist group Adbusters, which said the idea was "inspired by the Egyptian Tahrir Square uprising".
The pair presented an Egyptian flag with the message: "From Tahrir Square to Wall Street".
Occupy Wall Street protesters have been occupying Zuccotti Park since 17 September.
