New York (CNN) -- A New York Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Occupy protesters will be allowed to return to Zuccotti Park, but they can't bring their tents and generators -- once a mainstay of the movement.
Stallman said protesters' rights cannot come at the exclusion of those "who might wish to use the space safely."
"You are required to immediately remove all property, including tents, sleeping bags and tarps, from Zuccotti Park," the note said.
Police, however, did not immediately let them in, and a large group of demonstrators -- some of them apparently holding the court documents -- marched back to Zuccotti Park and presented the documents to police.
The Tuesday morning eviction of Zuccotti Park comes ahead of plans by the protesters to "shut down" Wall Street on Thursday -- to mark the two-month anniversary of their movement.
