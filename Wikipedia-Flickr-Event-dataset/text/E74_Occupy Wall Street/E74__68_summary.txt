Occupy Wall Street protesters have been ordered to leave Zuccotti Park, their longtime encampment in Lower Manhattan, but they've been told they can return once it has been cleaned.
Protesters were told they could return in several hours, but without sleeping bags, tarps or tents.
Members of the Occupy Wall St movement clashing with New York Police Department officers after being removed from Zuccotti Park in New York November 15, 2011.
Rabbi Chaim Gruber, an Occupy Wall Street member, said police officers were clearing the streets near Zuccotti Park.
Protesters on Monday announced on their website that they planned to "shut down Wall Street" with a demonstration on Thursday to commemorate the completion of two months of the beginning of the encampment, which has spurred similar demonstrations across the country.
