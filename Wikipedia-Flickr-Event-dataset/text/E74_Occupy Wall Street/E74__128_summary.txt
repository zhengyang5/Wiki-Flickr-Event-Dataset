Eric Neuschaefer, a DHS FOIA program specialist, said the agency expects to release a second set of OWS-related documents to Truthout, the first news organization to file a FOIA request with DHS for OWS records, sometime in mid-April.
Another Secret Service report, which described Occupy's first week of activities, noted, "this record was subject of FOIA request."
In addition to OWS documents, Truthout also sought internal DHS documents related to "US Day of Rage," a movement that preceded OWS.
Truthout has since filed a separate FOIA request with the FBI for processing notes to determine how the agency handled our FOIA request for OWS documents.
