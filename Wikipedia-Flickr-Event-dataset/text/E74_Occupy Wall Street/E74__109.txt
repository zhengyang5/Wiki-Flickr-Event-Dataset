NEW YORK - More than 500 "Occupy Wall Street" protesters rang in the new year by trying to retake Zuccotti Park in downtown Manhattan Saturday night, starting a clash with police in which one officer was stabbed in the hand with a pair of scissors.

Sixty-eight people were arrested, including one person charged with felony assault on a police officer for the stabbing, a spokesman for the New York Police Department told NewsCore.

The male officer was treated at a local hospital and later released.

The 67 others were charged with a variety of crimes including disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and trespassing.

Shortly before midnight, "Occupy" protesters took to Twitter to proclaim their assault on the park -- from which they were expelled by cops in November.

The New York Post reported that some 100 police officers -- including mounted police -- initially responded to the scene and began trying to clear the park at approximately 1:30am Sunday morning.
