The challenge Occupy Wall Street offers to Washington politics has caught media observers by surprise. It defies their assumptions that a movement without formal leaders or lots of money to publicize itself can't make a difference. But it is a mistake to think Occupy Wall Street is without historical roots. It joins a long list of political movements that have made their cause known by occupying public space.

The best-known early example was Coxey's Army, which in 1894 marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and briefly occupied the Capitol grounds. Led by Jacob Coxey, a quarry owner from Massillon, Ohio, the men and women of Coxey's Army, who called themselves the "Commonweal of Christ," sought to get Congress to end unemployment with legislation authorizing road building and other internal improvements. Coxey was eventually arrested, his army dispersed, but they set a precedent for how to get the attention of Congress and the media.

More than three decades later, in the early years of the Great Depression, a group of World War I vets, the Bonus Marchers, adopted a similar strategy. In 1932, they came to Washington, asking to have immediate payment of their Adjusted Service Certificate -- their bonus, as they called it.

Unable to get Congress and President Herbert Hoover to act, the Bonus Marchers set up camp in downtown Washington and along the Anacostia River in the hope that their presence would change hearts.

The Bonus Army was unsuccessful in 1932. The U.S. Army, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, routed them with tear gas, destroying the shantytowns they had set up. But in 1933, 1934 and 1935, when the Bonus Marchers came back to Washington, the Roosevelt administration let them stay at an Army post in Virginia and supplied them with tents and food. It was the start of a new day for the vets, and in 1936 Congress at last voted them their bonus.
