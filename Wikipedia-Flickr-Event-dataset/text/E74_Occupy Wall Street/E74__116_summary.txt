The police arrested 185 people on Monday as protesters tried to block access to the New York Stock Exchange on the first anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street protests.
Last year, protesters took over Zuccotti Park, not far from Wall Street, setting up an encampment that became an inspiration for similar Occupy campaigns around the world.
Marcus Yam for The New York TimesThough organizers said more than 1,000 people participated in the demonstration, the roving groups did not appear to cause much disruption on Wall Street.
Officers approached a man who had been yelling objections to the metal police barricades that cordoned off Wall Street.
Some people were arrested at a Bank of America branch opposite Zuccotti Park.
