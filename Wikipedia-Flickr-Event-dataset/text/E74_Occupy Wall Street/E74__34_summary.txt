The average income of the bottom 90 percent of households fell 7 percent from 2007 to 2008, in inflation-adjusted dollars, the largest one-year drop for this group since 1938.
[2] These data show that in the past decade, income concentration has reached levels last seen over 80 years ago (see Figure 2).
[4]With the latest IRS data, we now have both a complete picture of income concentration during the recent economic expansion, which ended in December 2007, and a glimpse of the recession’s effects on income concentration.
Saez notes, however, that historically income concentration tends to bounce back after economic downturns unless major policy changes — such as those enacted during the New Deal — occur.
So it would not be surprising, in the absence of significant policy or behavioral changes, for income concentration to return to recent levels and continue rising after the current recession ends.
