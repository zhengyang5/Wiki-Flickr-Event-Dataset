As the Occupy Wall Street movement loses steam, protesters are pitching new and creative ways to spend the $300,000 remaining in the kitty.
Among the suggestions aired at recent OWS meetings on how to slice up the Occu-pie were:Post photo composite1 Withdraw all the money in hundred-dollar bills, stuff the Benjamins in canvas bags and torch the cash in a bonfire on Wall Street.
An OWS general assembly approved this outlay last month and it was done.
OWS actually approved a $29,000 trip to Egypt for 20 members to show solidarity right before Zuccotti was shut down in November.
“This is an effort to ensure that we are able to continue to post bail for those arrested going into the spring,” the tabled proposal read.
