A report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) points out that income inequality in America has not risen dramatically over the past 20 yearsâ€”when the top 1% of earners are excluded.
The causes of the good fortune of those at the top are disputed, but the CBO provides some useful detail on that too.
The biggest component of the increase in after-tax income for the top one percent is "business income" as opposed to income from labour or investments (though admittedly these things are hard to untangle).
First, that a system that works well for the very richest has delivered returns on labour that are disappointing for everyone else.
But this downturn ought to test the normally warm feelings in America of the 99% towards the 1%.
