We greet the Occupy Wall St. movement as it spreads throughout our country from large cities to small towns, led by youth and joined by people of all ages and backgrounds, giving voice to deep anger at extreme economic inequality.

The unemployed, those who have lost their homes, who cannot afford education or healthcare, are joining together as the 99 percent, saying “enough is enough” to the enormous greed and arrogance of financial institutions.

An epic battle is underway for the direction of our country. The Occupy movement is not alone.

The remarkable battles of Wisconsin and Ohio for workers’ rights; and the extraordinary American Dream movement for jobs not cuts, taxing the rich and ending the wars represent the largest social movements of our times.

We stand with the courageous young people who have sparked this movement and join with the occupiers who are putting themselves on the line to transform our nation and achieve a secure and sustainable future.

We stand with all those fighting racism and all forms of bigotry which is being used by right wing opposition to confuse, divide and defeat this historic movement.

The time has come to put people before profits.
