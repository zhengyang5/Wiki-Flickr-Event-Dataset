Scores of Occupy Wall Street protesters were arrested on Saturday night as police officers swept Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan and closed it.
The operation occurred after hundreds of people had gathered in the financial district to observe the founding of Occupy Wall Street six months ago.
Over the next few hours, protesters conducted meetings inside Zuccotti Park and held a dance party fueled by a saxophone and a battery of drums.
At one point, the police arrested a handful of protesters on Cedar Street near Trinity Place.
At 10:30, protesters sprung up a green tarp, folded over a piece of rope suspended from two trees near the center of Zuccotti Park.
