The US press seems to have decided that the Occupy movement is no longer a story.

America is one of the few countries where May Day, the International Workers' Day, is not even a holiday â€“ ironically enough, considering the fact the date was chosen to commemorate events that occurred in Chicago, during the struggle for the 8-hour day in 1886.
The words might be diplomatically chosen, but there's no mistaking what tradition is being invoked here.
