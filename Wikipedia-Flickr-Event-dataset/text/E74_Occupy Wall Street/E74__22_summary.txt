(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks, cities have continued to remove Occupy Wall Street protesters from their encampments.
In 1937 alone, roughly 400,000 workers participated in nearly 500 sit-down strikes.
Indeed, several legal historians attribute the court's famous "switch in time" -- upholding the National Labor Relations Act in the case of NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. -- to the sit-down strikes.
The ejection of the Occupy Wall Street protesters from public spaces may, in the long run, work to the movement's benefit.
It also brings Occupy Wall Street more closely into line with the most effective occupation movements of the past century.
