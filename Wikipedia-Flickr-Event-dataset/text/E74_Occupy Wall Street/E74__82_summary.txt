Occupy Wall Street may not have tents anymore in Zuccotti Park, but they have plenty of money.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Just days after Occupy Wall Street's two month anniversary, Zuccotti Park sits nearly empty -- but the same can't be said about the movement's bank account.
Fundraising for the protest movement -- particularly online -- has been an incredible success, according to OWS finance group member Pete Dutro.
In the meantime, the movement will continue to organize out of donated office space and give money to other "occupations."
Combelic said his group gave money to Occupy Oakland and Occupy Harlem last week.
