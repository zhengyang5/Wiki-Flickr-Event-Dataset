The Occupy Wall Street movement cost the NYPD $17 million in overtime — half the total increase in the force’s OT budget over the past year, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said yesterday at a City Council budget hearing.
Kelly expects his department will spend $585 million on OT for the 2012 fiscal year — $34 million more than in fiscal year 2011.
