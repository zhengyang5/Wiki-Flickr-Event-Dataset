In a quiet corner across the street from Zuccotti Park, a cluster of 25 solemn-faced protesters struggled one night to give Occupy Wall Street what critics have found to be most lacking.
But the very nature of Occupy Wall Street has made that task difficult, in New York and elsewhere.
“It feels like we’re all in a similar boat,” Mr. Hines said of other Occupy movements.
“Let’s give ourselves two weeks,” Ms. McMillan said about presenting provisions to the General Assembly.
Elsewhere, Occupy Boston, Occupy D.C. and Occupy Philadelphia were among the many groups in the movement slowly formulating demands, though in each city, opposition has arisen from skeptical demonstrators.
