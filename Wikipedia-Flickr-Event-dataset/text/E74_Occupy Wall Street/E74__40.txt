FAIR's findings prompt a number of critiques, both of the media's attention span and of Occupy's lasting power. It is a troubling state of affairs that in order to push conversations about rampant inequality in the press, it seems there needs to be continuous, headline-grabbing protests, occupations and public manifestations of anger (with newsworthy slogans, of course). But this should perhaps come as no surprise -- after all, it was in recognition of our very troubling state of national and international affairs that Occupy participants took to the streets, parks and encampments in the first place.

Occupy supporters may well be saddened by FAIR's news: that their important messages about corporate greed and class disparity have not permanently shifted the mainstream media's coverage of these issues. Knefel's report is at once a reminder of the long slog it takes to really shift a discourse. It's a reminder too that mainstream media outlets are fickle creatures, ready to move on to the next shiny object with little focus on the issues underpinning stories.
