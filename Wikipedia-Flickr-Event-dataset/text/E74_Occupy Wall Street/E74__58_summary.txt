The Demands group, first publicized yesterday by the New York Times, hasn't shared its proposal until now.
Given that Occupy Wall Street is the first, largest, and most high-profile of the dozens of occupations around the country, any demand that it adopts could have a major impact on the movement.
But it's not all clear whether Lerner's demand, or any demand, for that matter, will make the cut.
It emerged two weeks ago out of Occupy Wall Street's Open Source Working Group, a collection of mostly young, tech-savvy occupiers.
Even if neither the blueprint nor the New New Deal goes anywhere with the larger crowd, they could still help Occupy Wall Street figure out what it wants to be.
