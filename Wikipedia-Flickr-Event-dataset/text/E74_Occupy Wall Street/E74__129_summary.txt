Police arrest demonstrators affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement after they attempted to cross the Brooklyn Bridge on the motorway on October 1, 2011 in New York City.
ETNEW YORK - Protesters speaking out against corporate greed and other grievances were maintaining a presence in Manhattan's Financial District Sunday even after more than 700 of them were arrested during a march on the Brooklyn Bridge in a tense confrontation with police.
"We were supposed to go up the pedestrian roadway," said Robert Cammiso, a 48-year-old student from Brooklyn told the Daily News.
Earlier Saturday, thousands who joined two other marches crossed the Brooklyn Bridge without problems.
Occupy Wall Street demonstrators have been camped in Zuccotti Park and have clashed with police on earlier occasions.
