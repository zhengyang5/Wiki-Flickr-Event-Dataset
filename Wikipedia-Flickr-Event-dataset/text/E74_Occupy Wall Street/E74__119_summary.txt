crimes and misdemeanors NYPD Arrests Almost 200 Occupy Protesters, Roughs Up City Councilman AgainThe September 17 one-year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street may not have had the energy or visibility of the movement at its peak last fall, but it did have clashes with the NYPD that were a real throwback.
"Have seen # NYPD show restraint," Williams tweeted before the incident.
"Just came back to #OWS smaller crowd tensions still high," he wrote a few hours later.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Williams said:Council Member Williams was in Zuccotti Park to observe and ensure that the rights of protesters are being protected, something which he has done at multiple Occupy Wall Street actions without incident.
Council Member Williams will continue to work with the NYPD and protesters to ensure both the protection of First Amendment rights and the safety and security of our city.
