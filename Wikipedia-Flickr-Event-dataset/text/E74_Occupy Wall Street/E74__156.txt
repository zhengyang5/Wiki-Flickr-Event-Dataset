I read this book because I've long had a macabre fascination with the junior analysts and the banking "lifestyle" (which seems to mean the lifestyle of people just starting out after college who live in apartment shares and piss away all their money trying to make girls at clubs think they're rich). I work in financial services, but I came to finance later in my career. I've never worked in a bank, so I don't know what it's like, but my colleagues who have didn't have an experience resembling this.



The book is amusing in parts and a quick, easy read. My main objection to the book is that it doesn't feel serious. It comes off mainly as an excuse for Roose to do "research" by spending a few years partying and going out for dinner with his college buddies. Then at the end of it all, he can write a cautionary book of amateur sociology.



Roose's most interesting observation is not new: smart and talented but risk-averse college students go into banking after they graduate because it's an easy way to continue the achievement oriented lives they're used to, and because it saves them any hard thinking about what the heck to do for a career. The descriptions of the lives of first- and second-year analysts are entertaining, and the subjects are likable. At some point Roose even decides his college buddies are too likable, so he goes out of his way to attend the Fashion Meets Finance party so he can report back that in fact, yes, all the people he hasn't met are awful. And that's the key problem with the book: it seems like he's working hard mostly to reinforce all the prejudices he started with.
