Eight Occupy Wall Streeters yesterday were found guilty of misdemeanor trespassing for invading a Trinity Church-owned lot a month after the city booted them out of Zuccotti Park.

Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Matthew Sciarrino ended the weeklong trial by giving each four days of community service.

He also convicted one of them, Mark Adams, of attempted criminal mischief and attempted criminal possession of burglar’s tools for trying to slice a chain-link fence’s locks with bolt cutters on Dec. 17.

He’ll have to serve 45 days in jail.
