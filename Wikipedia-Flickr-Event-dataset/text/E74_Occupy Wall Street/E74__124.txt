A Brooklyn man is under arrest tonight and being charged with sexually assaulting an 18 year-old woman at Zuccotti Park, home to the Occupy Wall Street movement. This as the Manhattan District Attorney's office is investigating allegations that he raped another 18 year-old woman.Tonye Iketubosin, 26, lives at 261 Buffalo Street in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. Known to Wall Street Occupiers as "Tonye Park," he is said to have been in Zuccotti Park for 2 weeks, volunteering as a cook.Iketubosin allegedly helped an 18 year-old set up her tent last Thursday and at one point refused to leave. According to police the victim was groped until she was able to get away. For that incident, he will be charged with forcible touching and sexual harrassment.The Manhattan District Attorney's office is interviewing another potential victim, a woman from Massachusetts. The victim in that case reportedly alleges the Brooklyn man came into the tent she was sleeping in and raped her. According to the Wall Street Journal, it followed an argument she had with a tent-mate. Iketubosin offered to let her sleep in his tent, saying he was going to work in the camp's kitchen. She allegedly woke to Iketubosin removing her pants, and despite her protests he did not stop.Late Wednesday night, the criminal charges against the suspect contained only allegations from the first incident, with no mention of the alleged rape. It's unclear how Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance plans to handle the rape allegation.
