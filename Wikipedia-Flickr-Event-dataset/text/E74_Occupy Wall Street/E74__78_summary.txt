The Spokes Council, so named because everyone sits around in a circle like the connecting spokes on a bike, differentiates itself from the G.A.
It’s real function though, is to determine which current working groups are viable, as well as help figure out day-to-day logistics for the Occupation.
The Village Voice noted only two major grievances that heated up the groups.
The first came courtesy of Greek artist and Direct Democracy working group member Georgia Sagri, who broke rank yesterday and grabbed the mic: “I think through the spokes council process, working groups become organizations and they become parties.
What’s the reason for us to marginalize ourselves?”Apparently, the group was also pissed that press were invited to the event, though they were less upset by The Village Voice than The New York Times.
