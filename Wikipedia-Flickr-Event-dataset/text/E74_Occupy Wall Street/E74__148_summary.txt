House Democratic Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she supports the growing nationwide Occupy Wall Street movement, which began on the streets of downtown New York City in mid-September.
Pelosi added that the failure of TARP, commonly known as the bank bailout, to add liquidity to the Main Street marketplace is fueling Americans' animosity towards Wall Street.
"The thought was that when we did that [pass TARP], there would be capital available and Main Street would benefit from the resources that went largely to Wall Street," said Pelosi.
The proposed American Jobs Bill is still awaiting a vote on the Senate floor on Tuesday.
Last Wednesday, Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., called the Occupy Wall Street protest a "growing mob."
