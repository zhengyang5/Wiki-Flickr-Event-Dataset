A confrontation between Occupy Wall Street demonstrators and New York City police was avoided after Brookfield Office Properties Inc. postponed cleaning its Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, where the protesters have been camping out for almost a month.
More than 3,000 people had gathered at the site, according to an e-mail from Patrick Bruner, an Occupy Wall Street spokesman.
Spreading GloballyThe Occupy Wall Street protest that began Sept. 17 has spread to cities including Denver, Boston and San Francisco.
Quality of LifeState Senator Daniel Squadron, a Democrat who represents Lower Manhattan, including the Zuccotti Park neighborhood, said he spoke with Clark last night, urging Brookfield to delay the cleanup.
Stephen Levin, 30, a City Council member from the 33rd District in Brooklyn, said the gathering of thousands at Zuccotti Park “made the difference.”“This park has become a symbol of this movement,” Levin said.
