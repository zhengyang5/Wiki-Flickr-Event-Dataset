In a tense showdown above the East River, the police arrested more than 700 demonstrators from the Occupy Wall Street protests who took to the roadway as they tried to cross the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday afternoon.
“Protesters who used the Brooklyn Bridge walkway were not arrested,” Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the New York Police Department, said.
Around 1 a.m., the first of the protesters held at the Midtown North Precinct on West 54th Street were released.
None of the protesters interviewed knew if the bridge march was planned or a spontaneous decision by the crowd.
Mr. Browne said that the police did not trick the protesters into going onto the bridge.
