(credit: YouTube)NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — “Blame the Jews.”That’s the message one Wall Street protester was trying to spread in Lower Manhattan to anyone that would listen.
A new video posted to YouTube shows the protester loudly and aggressively proclaiming “the Jews control Wall Street.”In the nearly 6-minute video, the man is seen standing in Zuccotti Park ranting against Israel and Jews while holding a sign reading “Hitler’s Bankers – Wall St.”The protestor, who would not give his name to those gathered around him, is also seen arguing with members of the public who took offense to his choice of words.
A number of others also ask the protester if Fox News had paid him to stand and display his sign to which he responded: “[expletive] Fox News, that’s [expletive].
[Expletive] Jew made that up.”Watch the video (warning: profane language) and share your thoughts in the comments section below…
