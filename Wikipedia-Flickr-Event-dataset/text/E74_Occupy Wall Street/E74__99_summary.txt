When the battery was fully charged, Mr. Stephan, said, it would be brought into the Occupy Wall Street encampment inside the park and used to power laptops and cellphones.
A few weeks ago he brought it to Zuccotti Park to serve as an example of how people there might create pollution-free energy.
Then, on Friday, the Fire Department confiscated several gasoline-powered generators that protesters had been using in the park and Mr. Stephan’s plan suddenly went from aspirational to operational.
“This was about dangerous conditions that were growing with numerous generators and numerous containers with flammable and combustible liquids,” he said.
As Mr. Stephan pedaled and sipped his cup of coffee, onlookers and passerby stopped to ask questions about the bike and the battery.
