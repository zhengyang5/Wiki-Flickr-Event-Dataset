On the one-year anniversary of the Occupy movement, a planned picket at the doors of the Citizens Bank in Burlington did not happen.
In Burlington, a series of weekly rallies and marches began about two weeks after a Sept. 17, 2011, call to occupy Wall Street.
In an April 29 statement Occupy Burlington announced plans for a permanent picket line outside the bank until it closes and leaves.
Jonathan Leavitt, a leading figure in Occupy Burlington and other local campaigns, has focused lately on the police response to protests at the Hilton hotel in July.
According to Nathan Schneider, an editor of the Waging Non-Violence website who observed Mondayâ€™s protests near Wall Street, the organizing was impressive.
