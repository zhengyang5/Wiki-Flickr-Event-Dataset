David Shankbone under a CC Licence 30 September 2011 - Day 14 of the Occupy Wall Street protests.
Those who have erected protest camps on Wall Street have found a great place to start.
Nevertheless, Wall Street institutions have tried hard to transgress even the lax standards that remain.
Groups such as the Project on Government Oversight have documented that, when top officials at the US governmentâ€™s main watchdogs do meet with the heads of Wall Street banks, it is often to interview for jobs.
And so it has been left to a protest occupation to say it: Wall Street, a global symbol of wealth, has plenty to teach the world about corruption.
