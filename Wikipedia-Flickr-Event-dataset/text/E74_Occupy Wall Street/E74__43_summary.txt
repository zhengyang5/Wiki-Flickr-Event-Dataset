In its very amateurism, Occupy Wall Street represents something new.
In its grassroots and leftist character, Occupy Wall Street bears a superficial resemblance to protests from the ’60s and early ’70s.
Economically, the U.S. is a different country than it was in 1970—and it will remain so regardless of how long the Occupy Wall Street protests endure.
Far from battling unions, Occupy Wall Street has their active support.
If Occupy Wall Street plans on hanging in for real change, the protesters will need to start trading in their tents for drywall.
