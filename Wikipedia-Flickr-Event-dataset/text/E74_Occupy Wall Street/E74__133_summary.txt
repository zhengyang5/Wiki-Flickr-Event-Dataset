A federal judge has ruled that the NYPD failed to sufficiently warn Occupy Wall Street protesters against walking on the roadway of the Brooklyn bridge in October, resulting in the arrest of roughly 700 people.
After reviewing video footage from both parties, judge Jed S Rakoff of the federal district court in Manhattan sided with the protesters.
The arrests marked one of the most famous moments of the early stages of the Occupy protests, drawing international headlines and more participants to the movement.
"A reasonable officer in the noisy environment defendants occupied would have known that a single bull horn could not reasonably communicate a message to 700 demonstrators," Rakoff wrote in his decision.
It was the police that blocked the bridge for hours to conduct these unlawful arrests."
