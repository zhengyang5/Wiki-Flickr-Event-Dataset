NEW YORK -- A small but passionate crowd of activists gathered at the east end of Lower Manhattanâ€™s Zuccotti Park Wednesday to mark the third anniversary of Occupy Wall Street.
The crowd of about two dozen protesters led chants and waved makeshift signs representing numerous offshoots of the Occupy brand, including Occupy the Media, a collective of independent journalists, and Occupy Solutions, a group working toward long-term solutions to economic issues.
While the crowds have gotten decidedly smaller every year, those who remain say the spirit of Occupy is still very much alive.
Flood Wall Street, a climate change march planned for Battery Park on Monday, has more than 2,000 guests signed up to attend on Facebook.
Some at Zuccotti Park said they planned to attend as well.
