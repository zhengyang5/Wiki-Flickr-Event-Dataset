The Occupy Wall Street movement has cost surrounding businesses $479,400 so far, store owners said.
The restaurateur -- who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals -- said his profits drained as soon as campers moved in.
It’s worst on Saturdays, when protesters parade up and down Broadway all day long, the businesses said.
“When they march on the sidewalk, everyone runs away,” said Mike Rauach, owner of VIP Men’s Suits on Broadway.
The movement costs the dozen businesses just over $9,000 a day.
