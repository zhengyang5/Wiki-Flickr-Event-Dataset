According to World Bulletin, the monitoring group estimates that over 9,000 people have been killed as a result of Boko Haram violence in 2014, while over 1.5 million people have been displaced from their homes due to the conflict.
Another estimation done by the Council for Foreign Relations found a similar number when it reported that over 10,340 deaths occurred from November 2013 to November 2014 due to Boko Haram violence.
"Almost every day in 2014 was marred by deadly attack by Boko Haram, unlike previous years," Police Chief Alhaji Yusuf Hassan said.
Boko Haram became a household name in April when it made headlines by kidnapping 276 schoolgirls from a secondary school in the town of Chibok.
