The city of Maiduguri in north-east Nigeria is a stronghold of the Islamist sect, Boko Haram.
In the days that led up to Yusuf’s arrest, over 300 people were killed in fierce fighting between state security forces and Boko Haram fighters.
Since the death of its leader, Boko Haram has hit back with reprisal attacks against government officials and religious leaders, prompting intervention from the Joint Military Task Force.
But human rights groups say that restoring order has come at the cost of dozens of civilian lives.
“When Boko Haram detonate their bombs and follow it up with indiscriminate killing, we try to arrest them," he says.
