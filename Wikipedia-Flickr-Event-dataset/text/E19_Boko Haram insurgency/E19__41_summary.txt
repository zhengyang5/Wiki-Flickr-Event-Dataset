NIgeria - IOM is working with its partners to help the Nigerian government to support some 2.4 million people in the country’s northeastern states displaced by the Boko Haram insurgency.
Through its Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), IOM is conducting assessments of the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the area and their needs to inform the humanitarian response of the government and the international community.
In the worst-affected state of Borno, IOM teams are currently working in 15 previously inaccessible local government areas (LGAs) and 86 wards and hope to access other badly affected areas.
IOM Nigeria Chief of Mission Enira Krdzalic said: “In support of the National Emergency Management Agency, IOM is systematically collecting data on the humanitarian crisis in northeast Nigeria and neighboring countries.
IOM is calling for more donor support, as well as deeper collaboration among humanitarian actors for effective coordination of humanitarian assistance to the affected population.
