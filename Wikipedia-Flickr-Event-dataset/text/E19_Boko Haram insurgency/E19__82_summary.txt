Over the weekend, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau pledged his loyalty to ISIS in a video shared on Twitter.
ReutersAccordingly, some experts believe Boko Haram's pledge shows that the group is on the defensive.
"For Isis, Boko Haramâ€™s offer of an ideological alliance is grist to its international propaganda mill, boosting its global profile," writes Simon Tisdall at The Guardian.
Previously, Boko Haram had been linked to al Qaeda, which is considered to be a more powerful force in Africa than ISIS, despite the recent establishment of Islamic State footholds on the continent.
For the time being, Boko Haram already has its hands full.
