Last month, Boko Haram said it had established an Islamic state in areas it controls in north-eastern Nigeria.
Residents told BBC Hausa that Boko Haram captured Bama after heavy fighting on Sunday and Monday.
The military had initially repelled Boko Haram's assault, but the group returned with reinforcements to seize the town, the residents said.
Several security sources said Boko Haram had over-run much of Bama and there were heavy casualties on both sides, Reuters news agency reports.
