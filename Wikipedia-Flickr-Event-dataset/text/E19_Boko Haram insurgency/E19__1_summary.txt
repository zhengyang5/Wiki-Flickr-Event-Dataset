YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Cameroon, which is battling to stop the advance of Nigerian Boko Haram militants on its territory, will vote in the coming days on whether to impose the death penalty on those found guilty of involvement in acts of terrorism.
Boko Haram fighters have made repeated incursions into the rugged Far North region of Cameroon in recent months.
They have clashed with Cameroonian soldiers sent to the border to stop them and are blamed for dozens of deaths and kidnappings there.
“The draft law provides the ultimate penalty, the death penalty, for anyone who personally, in complicity or under coercion commits a terrorist act,” Parliament Speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril said.
Cameroon has reinforced its military presence on its northeastern border as part of regional efforts to combat Boko Haram.
