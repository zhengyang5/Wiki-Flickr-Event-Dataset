MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Aug 5 (Reuters) - At least 35 people have been killed in two separate gun battles between Nigerian security forces and Islamist sect Boko Haram in northeast Borno state, the army said on Monday.
Boko Haram, which wants to impose sharia law in Nigeria’s north, and other spin-off Islamist groups have become the biggest threat to stability in Africa’s top oil exporter.
“Troops have successfully repelled Boko Haram terrorist attacks on a police base in Bama ... on 4 August,” said military spokesman Sagir Musa.
Musa said one policeman and 17 members of Boko Haram were killed during the fighting, while two soldiers were injured.
Boko Haram launched its insurgency in 2009 and has become increasingly sophisticated, learning bomb-making techniques from al Qaeda-linked militants in the Sahara to the north of Nigeria.
