At Hollande’s Paris conference, West African leaders vowed to take concerted action to fight Boko Haram.
“Boko Haram is no longer a local terrorist group, it is operating clearly as an al-Qaeda operation.
“We are here to declare war on Boko Haram,” said Cameroon’s President Paul Biya, with the leaders of Niger, Chad and Benin concurring.
Biya cast the Boko Haram problem wider, as an international issue, recalling the organisation’s kidnapping last month of two Italian priests and a Canadian nun.
The US and UK were also present and will contribute to the West African fight, probably through intelligence gathering.
