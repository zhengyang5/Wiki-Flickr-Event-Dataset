It also expressed worry that both governments had not considered meeting discreetly with the parents and guardians of the allegedly abducted girls.
About 20 teenage girls were reportedly kidnapped from a school premises in Borno State about a month ago.
HURIWA, in the statement by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, and National Media Officer, Zainab Yusuf, said the federal government was obliged to rescue alive the kidnapped innocent students before further irreparable physical and psychological harm happened to them while in captivity.
The group alleged that corruption had done extensive damage in the ministry, especially in the procurement department, which had led to the near-crippling of the armed forces as had been severally reported.
