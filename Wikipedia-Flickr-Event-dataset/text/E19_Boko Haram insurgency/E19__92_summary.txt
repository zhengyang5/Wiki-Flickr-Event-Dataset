ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian government forces recaptured the northeastern city of Bama from Islamist Boko Haram insurgents, the army said on Monday, a significant victory for the government just two weeks before a national election.
Boko Haram had held Bama, situated in Borno state where their six-year-old insurgency to establish a medieval-style Islamic caliphate has been centered, since September last year.
Boko Haram managed to take control of territory the size of Belgium by the beginning of 2015.
â€œNigerian troops have this afternoon routed terrorists from Bama in Borno state.
The elections were postponed in February by six weeks, with the military citing Boko Haram as warranting the delay.
