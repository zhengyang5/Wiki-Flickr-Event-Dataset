Human Rights Watch has accused Nigerian armed group Boko Haram of abducting scores of women and girls and of using children as young as 12 in its combat operations.
It was the most lethal incident in Borno State since 2010, according to the rights group.
The Civilian Joint Task Force is allied with Nigerian security forces and is helping in the fight against Boko Haram.
Several witnesses said they had seen children in the ranks of Boko Haram during attacks.
In Maiduguri, Human Rights Watch researchers saw a video recording of the interrogation by security forces of a 14-year-old boy, who described the role he played in Boko Haram operations.
