Suspected Boko Haram militants have begun an assault on Nigeriaâ€™s north-eastern city of Maiduguri, according to military, government and local sources.
All roads have been closed, a security source said, and commercial activity has been shut down.
The militants began the attack at the edge of the city in the Njimtilo area shortly after midnight on Saturday.
A security source told the Guardian that on Saturday four teenagers had turned themselves over to civilian vigilantes who work alongside the military.
Jonathan visited the state capital on Saturday as part of his campaign and opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari was due to arrive on Monday.
