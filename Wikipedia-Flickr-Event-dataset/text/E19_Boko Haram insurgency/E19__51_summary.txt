This article chronicles the rise of Boko Haram, identifying the two phases in which the group has passed.
Boko Haram: Phase IRelations between Boko Haram and other Nigerian radical groups are unclear.
Boko Haram: Phase IIThere is no doubt that the suppression operation of 2009, and the killing of Muhammad Yusuf by Nigerian security forces in July of that year, was a turning point for Boko Haram.
It is interesting, however, that its targets have been very specific, and that in contradistinction to other Muslim groups Boko Haram has only rarely attacked Christians.
