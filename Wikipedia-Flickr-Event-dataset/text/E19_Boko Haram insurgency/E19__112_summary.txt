Boko Haram achieved global notoriety when they kidnapped 276 Chibok schoolgirls in 2014.
Their goal was not to strip their victims of their meagre possessions but to restock the commodity they most value — people.
In a swift and brutal mission, the militants, part of the Boko Haram movement, took 40 women, children and young adults into the bush.
Another 18, who appeared to have resisted or refused, had their throats cut and were left to die.
The attack in the town of Banki, on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon, was the latest to belie repeated government claims, including those of President Buhari of Nigeria, that Boko Haram has been “technically defeated”.
