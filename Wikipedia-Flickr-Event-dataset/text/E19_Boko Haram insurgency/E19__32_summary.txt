LAGOS—No fewer than 300 Boko Haram fighters have surrendered in Nigeria’s neighbouring country Cameroon in the past three weeks, Cameroon’s defense ministry has said.
Cameroon soldiers also Saturday captured Abakar Ali, one of Boko Haram top commanders.
Cameroonian soldiers nabbed Mr. Ali with two other Boko Haram fighters in Kousseri, a town in northern Cameroon.
Ali often shuttled between various Boko Haram camps in the area and organized deadly attacks that targeted mostly civilians.
Prior to the emergence of reports that Shekau has been killed, President Goodluck Jonathan has revealed that the Boko Haram would end by next month.
