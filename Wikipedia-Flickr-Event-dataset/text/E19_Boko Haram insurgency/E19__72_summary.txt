Nigeria's ignored massacre: 2,000 slaughtered by Boko Haram, 30,000 flee their homes BelfastTelegraph.co.uk One of Africa's most senior church leaders has accused the West of ignoring the threat of the militant Islamist group Boko Haram, days after the reported slaughter of up to 2,000 people by the group.
However, Boko Haram, which regards democracy as blasphemous, is expected to do all it can to disrupt the elections.
"I believe that Boko Haram and their allies want to cause more harm, more destruction.
"All I could hear were ceaseless gunshots, explosions, screams from people and chants of Allahu Akbar [God is greatest] from the Boko Haram gunmen.
"The number of soldiers, policemen and officers of the State Security Services they deploy during elections, if they had deployed them to Borno and Yobe states to fight Boko Haram, by now, Boko Haram would have been history."
