(Boko Haram via Agence France-Presse)The abduction in April of nearly 300 schoolgirls from Chibok, a northeastern Nigerian village, by fighters of the extremist group Boko Haram received wide attention from social media campaigners and the news media.
The Nigeria Social Violence Dataset, now publicly available, tallies incidents of deadly social violence in Nigeria since 1998, the eve of the most recent transition to democracy.
Since July 2009, when the Boko Haram conflict escalated, at least 11,100 people have died on all sides of the insurgency.
These statistics firmly place the Boko Haram insurgency as one of the most significant conflicts in the world.
After a year of regrouping, Boko Haram emerged under the leadership of Abubakar Shekau with a more militant agenda and brutal tactics.
