British armed forces offered to attempt to rescue nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, but were rebuffed by Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeriaâ€™s president at the time, the Observer has learned.
Notes from meetings between UK and Nigerian officials, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, also suggest that Nigeria shunned international offers to rescue the girls.
Boko Haram had raided the dormitories of the government secondary school at Chibok.
Boko Haram looted the school and then burned it to the ground.
In addition to Nigeria, Boko Haram is active in regions of Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
