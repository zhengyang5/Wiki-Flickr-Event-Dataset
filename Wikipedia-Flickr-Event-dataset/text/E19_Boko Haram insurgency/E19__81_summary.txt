Boko Haram began a military campaign to impose Islamic rule in northern Nigeria in 2009.
In the past Boko Haram is thought to have had links with al-Qaeda.
Boko Haram's insurgency has threatened Nigeria's territorial integrity and triggered a humanitarian crisis.
The Nigerian military and troops from neighbouring states have recently claimed a series of successes in their efforts to push back Boko Haram.
