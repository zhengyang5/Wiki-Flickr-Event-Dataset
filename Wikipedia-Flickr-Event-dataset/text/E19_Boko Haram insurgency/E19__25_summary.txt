KADUNA (Reuters) - An Islamist group blamed for abducting Westerners claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on Nigerian troops heading to Mali on Sunday, according to the local Desert Herald, which often publishes their claims.
Suspected Islamist gunmen opened fire on a convoy of troops leaving northern Nigeria en route to deployment with West African forces in Mali, killing two officers and wounding eight others, in Kogi state, central Nigeria.
The statement in the online newspaper said the attack was part of a mission to stop Nigerian troops joining Western powers in their "aim to demolish the Islamic empire of Mali."
Ansaru is one of several radical Islamist groups seen as the leading security threat to Africa's top energy producer.
Thought to be a breakaway from Islamist sect Boko Haram, it has risen to greater prominence over the past few months.
