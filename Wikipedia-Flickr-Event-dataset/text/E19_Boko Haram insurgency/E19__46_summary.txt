Boko Haram has been described as one of the world's deadliest terror groups.
Critics of the government argue that it has exaggerated the scale of its success against the militants, and that each time the army claims to have wiped out Boko Haram, the militants have quietly rebuilt.
"Boko Haram has reverted to using improvised explosive devices (IEDs)," he said.
Boko Haram as an organised fighting force, I assure you, that we have dealt with them."
