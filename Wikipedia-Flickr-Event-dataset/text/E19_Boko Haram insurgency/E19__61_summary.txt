As a regional insurgency waged by Boko Haram has spread, the group has sought to retaliate against government offensives by attacking government schools.
In traditional Koranic schools, pupils receive no formal education but spend their days memorising the Koran.
Abu Qaqa, a spokesman for Boko Haram, declared the attacks on schools would escalate as long as the government soldiers involved in the assault targeted Koranic schools.
“When you attack Koran schools, you totally destroy Western schools,” his message said.
President Jonathan has declared Boko Haram a threat to Nigeria’s integrity and sought Western support for an offensive to crush the group.
