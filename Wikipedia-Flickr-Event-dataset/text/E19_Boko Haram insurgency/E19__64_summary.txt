Abuja: More than 100 teenage girls were abducted Monday in northeastern Nigeria by suspected Boko Haram members, local sources and police said.
The victims were taken from the Girls College in Northern Borno stateâ€™s Chibok Town, Xinhua quoted Lawan Tanko, local police chief as saying.
About 105 teenage girls were selected by gunmen, who stormed the school dormitories in a raid that lasted more than four hours.
The all-female college is said to have at least 250 students, residents said.
About two months ago, more than 40 government college students were slain in Buni Yadi in neighbouring Yobe state.
