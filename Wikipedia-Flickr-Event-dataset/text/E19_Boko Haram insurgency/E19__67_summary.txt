The Islamist group Boko Haram has been accused of killing at least 27 people in attacks on two villages in north-east Nigeria, close to where hundreds of schoolgirls were seized.
On Tuesday 118 people died in a double bombing in the central city of Jos, also blamed on Boko Haram.
Many parts of restive north-east Nigeria are no-go zones for the military and insurgents operate freely there, correspondents say.
Villagers in Alagarno said the suspected Boko Haram fighters had arrived at night, forcing many residents to flee into the bush.
US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the bombing, and other recent attacks blamed on Boko Haram, were "unconscionable, terrorist acts".
