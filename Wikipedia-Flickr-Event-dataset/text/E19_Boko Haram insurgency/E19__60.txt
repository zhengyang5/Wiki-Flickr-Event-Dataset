Al Jazeera has obtained the first images of the Nigerian army's battle against Boko Haram fighters in the northern state of Borno.



The pictures appear to show the bodies of Boko Haram rebels and many civilians, including women and children.

One soldier told Al Jazeera he had seen almost 3,000 corpses.

The Nigerian army have been fighting the group since a state of emergency was declared on May 14 in areas where the fighters have been operating.

The Nigerian army has also released 58 women and children suspected of having links to Boko Haram.

Al Jazeera's Yvonne Ndege reports exclusively from Maiduguri.

Warning: Some viewers may find the images disturbing.
