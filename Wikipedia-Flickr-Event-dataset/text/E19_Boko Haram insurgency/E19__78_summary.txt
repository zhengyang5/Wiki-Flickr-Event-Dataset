Nigeria's electoral commission announced it will postpone elections for six weeks as a multinational force from Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Benin, and Niger attempt to secure a large swath of northeast land from Boko Haram.
Police prevented them from entering the electoral commission headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria's capital.
Electoral officials were meeting with political parties Saturday, asking their views on a postponement requested by the national security adviser, politician Bashir Yusuf told reporters.
The Nigerian official, who is knowledgeable of the discussions, said the Independent National Electoral Commission will announce the postponement later Saturday.
A postponement also will give electoral officials more time to deliver some 30 million voter cards.
