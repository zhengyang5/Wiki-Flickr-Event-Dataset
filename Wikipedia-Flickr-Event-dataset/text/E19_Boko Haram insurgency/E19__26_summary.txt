Nigeria-based Boko Haram militants attacked neighboring Chad for the first time, killing several civilians in a border town.
Boko Haram fighters have killed several civilians after an overnight attack in the Chadian town of Ngouboua, the first such deadly attack in Chad.
Chad’s Army, one of the strongest in Africa, has joined the multinational effort against Boko Haram alongside Nigeria, Niger, Benin, and Cameroon.
“We are absolutely determined because Boko Haram is a threat to the entire subregion.
However, there is widespread skepticism over whether the militaries can make enough ground against Boko Haram in time for the election.
