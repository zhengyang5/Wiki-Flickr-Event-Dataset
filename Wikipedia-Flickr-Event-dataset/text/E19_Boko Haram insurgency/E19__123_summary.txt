US envoy Samantha Power said it was an "important step" in support of efforts to "defeat Boko Haram and hold its murderous leadership accountable".
Meanwhile, Boko Haram has been blamed for the killing of more than 30 people in attacks overnight on three villages in north-eastern Borno state.
Boko Haram has carried out an extremely brutal campaign of violence especially over the last five years, killing thousands.
The UN decision suits the Nigerian government which wants to portray Boko Haram as an international issue partly to deflect criticism.
