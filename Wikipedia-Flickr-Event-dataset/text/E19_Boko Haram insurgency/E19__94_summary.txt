As this Reuters graphic shows, since launching a counter-attack against Boko Haram in January, the Nigerian army and some 8,700 allied troops have systemically contained the Islamist fighting force.
Nearly 700 girls and women were freed this past week during the push to confine the group in the Sambisa Forest.
Some of those freed described Boko Haram soldiers as dispirited and in disarray, lacking guns, ammunition and working vehicles, and openly criticizing their leadership while speaking of desertion.
It has been over a year since the Islamist terrorist organization Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from their school in Chibok, prompting world-wide outrage under the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag.
UNICEF believes the 1.5 million people displaced by the fighting in northeastern Nigeria includes 800,000 children.
