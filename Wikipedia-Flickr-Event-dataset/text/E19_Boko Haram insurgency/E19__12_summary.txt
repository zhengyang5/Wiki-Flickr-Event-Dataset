Nigeria’s Chief of army staff, Lt. General Tukur Yusuf Buratai is on a visit to Colombia’s army headquarters in Bogota.
Colombia like Nigeria, has been fighting the insurgency of armed rebels, the most known being FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia).
In October 2015, former Nigerian leader, Olusegun Obasanjo brought a couple of Colombian security experts to President Muhammadu Buhari and recommended them to assist Nigeria in fighting the seven year-old Boko Haram insurgency.
Colombia has been in a state of war for over five decades.
