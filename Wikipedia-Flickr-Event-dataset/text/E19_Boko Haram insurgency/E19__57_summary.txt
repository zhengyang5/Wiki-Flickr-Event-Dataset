But the leader of the Boko Haram Islamist group is alive and has released a new video threatening the Nigerian state.
On the security front, violence has been spiraling since a series of Boko Haram attacks targeted Christians on Christmas Day in the mainly Muslim north.
The exodus was sparked by last week’s warning from Boko Haram that Christians had three days to get out of northern Nigeria.
Across Nigeria, the group is better known as Boko Haram, which in Hausa, means, “Western education is forbidden”.
In Shekau’s case, Nigerian officials believed he had been killed in clashes between security forces and Boko Haram militants in 2009.
