Boko Haram launched its first major attack in Niger on Friday, triggering a forceful response from regional troops who claimed to have killed more than a hundred of the Islamists.
Chadian forces, who have taken a lead role in battling Boko Haram in recent days, fought alongside Niger troops on Friday.
Chad's army said it had killed more than 200 Boko Haram fighters in the clashes.
In response, Boko Haram launched a bloody counter-attack on the Cameroonian town of Fotokol, killing 19 soldiers and at least 81 civilians.
The Boko Haram conflict has killed at least 13,000 people and forced more than a million from their homes since 2009.
