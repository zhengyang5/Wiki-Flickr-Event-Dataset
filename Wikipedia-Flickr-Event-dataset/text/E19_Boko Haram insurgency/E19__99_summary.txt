In his first trip overseas since taking command of U.S. Special Operations a month ago, Gen. Raymond Thomas told a Middle Eastern audience recently that "complex" fails to adequately describe the current security environment.
That complexity is leading the Obama administration to expand the use of small teams of Special Operators in various terror hotspots.
Thomas previously served as head of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command -- the unit that includes Navy SEALS, the Army's Delta Force and other covert Special Operations units.
"We are attempting to identify opportunities to expand [Special Operations'] global presence, forward access and relationships to leverage opportunities short of crisis," Thomas said.
The military characterizes many of the operations as "advising and assisting" local forces with intelligence and overhead surveillance to help identify targets.
