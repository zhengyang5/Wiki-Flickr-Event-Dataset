PARIS, France - Nigeria has reached an agreement with its neighbours to combat the militant group Boko Haram.
On April 14th, Boko Haram abducted 276 students from their secondary school in the northeastern town of Chibok.
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has warned that Boko Haram is no longer acting as a local terror group but has joined with al-Qaeda.
He said the threat from the terror group meant there would be more deadly gun and bomb attacks in the future.
Boko Haram has said its goal is to overthrow the Nigerian government and to stop all aspects of Western education in the country.
