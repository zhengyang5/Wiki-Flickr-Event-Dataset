ABUJA (Reuters) - The leader of Nigerian Islamist sect Boko Haram said recent killings of Christians were justifiable revenge attacks and President Goodluck Jonathan had no power to stop the group’s insurgency, in the first video of him posted online.
“Everyone knows how our leader was murdered and everyone knows the way the Muslims were killed,” Shekau says, remaining stony faced and calm throughout.
The most recent attacks have targeted Christians but dozens of Muslims were killed by the sect last year.
“Four people were shot dead this afternoon but I cannot confirm whether the attackers were Boko Haram,” said Tanko Lawal, police commander in Yobe state.
Yobe’s government said on Wednesday it has banned the use of motorbikes, which have often been used in Boko Haram attacks, in volatile areas of the state.
