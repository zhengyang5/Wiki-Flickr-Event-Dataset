Up to 100 British soldiers are being lined up for a mission to train the Nigerian army in its fight against the Islamist extremists of Boko Haram.
It comes amid speculation that 60 SAS troopers have been sent to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) on the ground.
The Nigerian army is said to be poorly run and has been subject to allegations of corruption.
A senior military source said: "We have a small military training mission in Nigeria of only around a dozen.
We are thinking of boosting that by maybe up to 100 because the Nigerian Army is making woeful progress against Boko Haram.
