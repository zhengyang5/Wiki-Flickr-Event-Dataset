"There is determination to tackle this situation head on ... to launch a war, a total war on Boko Haram," Chad's President Idriss Deby said.
"The threat is serious and dangerous for the region, Africa and Europe," French President Francois Hollande said, although no concrete operational measures were announced.
Boko Haram has already targeted French interests in Nigeria, kidnapping a French family in northern Cameroon last year.
"We have affirmed our solidarity and determination to vigorously fight Boko Haram," Cameroon President Paul Biya said.
Biya said he would send more means and troops to the north, but that Boko Haram had been picking soft targets and outnumbering his troops.
