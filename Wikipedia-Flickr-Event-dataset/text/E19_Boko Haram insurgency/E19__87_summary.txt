Michelle Faul and Haruna Umar , The Associated PressABUJA, Nigeria -- Boko Haram extremists killed 41 people, including a legislator, and scared hundreds of people from polling stations in the northeast, but millions voted across Nigeria Saturday in the most closely contested presidential race in the nation's history.
Earlier, before dawn, Boko Haram extremists invaded the town of Miringa in Borno state, torching people's homes and then shooting them as they tried to escape the smoke.
Two voters were killed in Boko Haram attacks on polling stations in the twin Gombe towns of Birin Bolawa and Birin Fulani, according to police.
"We have to wait for the time when the Nigerian army will totally wipe them (Boko Haram) out before we can go back," she said after voting.
International outrage has grown over another failure -- the inability to rescue 219 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram nearly a year ago.
