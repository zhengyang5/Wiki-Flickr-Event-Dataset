The war against Boko Haram has become a regional one as well, with Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Benin agreeing to contribute troops to an 8,700-member force to fight the militants.
According to the senior Nigerian official, Chad’s army was playing a significant role against Boko Haram, having recaptured a number of towns from the militants.
But he said the South African mercenaries had also changed the momentum in the military effort.
