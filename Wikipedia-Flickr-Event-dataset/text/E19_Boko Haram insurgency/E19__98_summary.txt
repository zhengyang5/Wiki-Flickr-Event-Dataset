Many experts on Boko Haram say the women and girls who are deployed have been brainwashed or are simply unaware that the devices they are carrying can kill them.
Others say at least some of the women and girls, forcibly married to Boko Haram members, support the groupâ€™s cause of insurgency against secularism and for the creation of a strict Islamic state.
In northern Nigeria, local government officials said as many as 1,000 women and girls were recently rescued from the village of Boboshe and taken to the Dikwa camp.
They told officials they had been used as sex slaves.
In the past, women rescued from Boko Haram have said they were raped repeatedly, with some reporting that they thought they were being impregnated to create a new generation of Boko Haram fighters.
