MONDAY DISCOURSE WITH DR. ALIYU U. TILDE (Discourse 261) We Are Boko Haram aliyutilde@yahoo.com An inhouse survey into the cultural origins of boko haram movement in Nigeria _____________________________________________________________ So many readers have sent text messages asking me to write on boko haram.
One would wonder how much has changed in our perception of western education during the last century.
Why can’t we come out of self-imposed boko haram prison that our ancestors built over a century before?
Boko haram ideas will remain with us for quite some time unless we consciously change our attitudes and actively campaign against them.
In conclusion I must say that Yar’adua would need more guns to silence the anti-modern boko haram attitude in us.
