A Boko Haram faction responsible for the kidnapping of a Nigerian oil prospecting team, which led to the deaths of at least 37 people, has become a deadly force capable of carrying out highly organized attacks.
“The Shekau faction does not seem to have a clear ideology or any strategy,” said Liewerscheidt.
That makes it easier for al-Barnawi’s faction to recruit, whereas Shekau’s faction was not trusted by locals, he said.
Boko Haram, which has killed more than 20,000 people and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes since 2009, split last year.
​Ransom moneyA security analyst said Shekau’s wing used ransom money paid by the government to free Chibok girls to buy weapons and recruit fighters.
