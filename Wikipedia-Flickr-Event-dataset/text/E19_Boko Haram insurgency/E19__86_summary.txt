News of Gwoza's recapture comes a day before presidential elections, which were postponed by six weeks because of the offensive against Boko Haram.
Meanwhile, the president of Chad, which is helping Nigeria fight Boko Haram, has strongly criticised Nigeria's military.
The town is not far from Chibok, where Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls from a boarding school last April.
Nigeria 'uncooperative'After his fighters captured Gwoza in August 2014, the Boko Haram leader declared a caliphate in areas under his control.
He told French magazine Le Point that Chadian troops have had to retake towns twice from Boko Haram because Nigeria's forces had failed to secure them.
