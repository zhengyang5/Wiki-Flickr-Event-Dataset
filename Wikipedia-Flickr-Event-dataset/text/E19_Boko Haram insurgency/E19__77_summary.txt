Last week's assault by Boko Haram on the city was also stopped by the army.
Boko Haram began guerrilla operations in 2009 to create an Islamic state.
It has taken control of many towns and villages in north-eastern Nigeria in the last year.
However, Boko Haram has stepped up attacks since then and there are fears that many people in the north-east will not be able to vote in the election because of the conflict.
The African Union (AU) has this week backed plans for a West African task force of 7,500 troops to fight Boko Haram.
