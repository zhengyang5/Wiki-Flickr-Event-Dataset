The deaths of hundreds of people in detention facilities run by Nigeria’s military Joint Task Force (JTF) must be investigated as a matter of urgency, Amnesty International said today.
“The evidence we’ve gathered suggests that hundreds of people died in military custody in 2013 alone.
Several other sources told Amnesty International that the same mortuary received a daily delivery of bodies by the JTF.
Information received by Amnesty International indicates that post-mortem examinations are not carried out at the mortuary or elsewhere.
“International standards, as well as Nigerian laws, require that deaths in custody must be investigated thoroughly and impartially,” said Lucy Freeman.
