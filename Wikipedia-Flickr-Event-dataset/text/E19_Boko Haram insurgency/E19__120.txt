According to reports, Boko Haram may have up to 60,000 fighters in its fast growing army.

This was reportedly revealed to The Nation by an inside source who was supposedly involved in peace talks with the sect.

The source also spoke on the solution to the insurgency and reasons why the Boko Haram problem is hard to tackle.

“Boko Haram has nearly 10,000 ideological army and over 50,000 conscripts, including 40 per cent underage. We are not even counting numerous sect members in Abuja, Kano, Bauchi and in different parts of Nigeria, West Africa and as far as Sudan,” the source said.

“Most of them prefer to die in battle than to be back to their camps safely due to the endemic indoctrination within the cult group. This is the reason why I always say here and everywhere that this crisis is far from over. The only thing for now: Ya Allah protect us and unite us to defeat our enemies.” the source added.

The source said further that Boko Haram is running operations in Kogi and Lagos and has members in various parts of the country and as far as in Sudan.

According to the source, the insurgency is far worse than Nigerians are being made to think and the way forward is for all citizens to come together and determine the root of the problem so as to find a solution.
