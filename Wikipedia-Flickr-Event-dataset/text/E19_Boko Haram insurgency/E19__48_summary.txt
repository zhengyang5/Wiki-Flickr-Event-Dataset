It was the first death sentence that has been carried out since Sharia (Islamic law) was extended to cover criminal offences in several northern states of Nigeria.
Sharia courts have also sentenced defendants to other cruel punishments, including floggings and amputations.
Sani Yakubu Rodi was reportedly caught at the scene of the murder and immediately arrested by the police.
Sani Yakubu Rodi did not have legal representation at any stage of his trial; he apparently told the court that he would defend himself.
Human Rights Watch also warned that executions under Sharia are likely to heighten tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in northern Nigeria.
