Mr Vaughan was killed along with six other foreign nationals after being snatched three weeks ago.
Al-Qaeda-linked group Ansaru said it had executed the workers seized in the northern state of Bauchi because of attempts by Nigerian and British forces to free them.
The Islamist extremists claimed they acted after British planes had been spotted at a Nigerian airport, suggesting a rescue operation was under way.
The Ansaru terrorists published grainy photos, purporting to show the bodies of a Briton, an Italian, a Greek and four Lebanese snatched from Lebanese firm Setraco.
Ansaru was suspected of killing British hostage Chris McManus and an Italian a year ago.
