Three Al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadi groups based in Africa’s Sahel region have announced a merger, creating a unified militant base in a region threatened by instability.
A video sent to Mauritanian private news agency ANI showed five jihadi leaders sat together, with Iyad Ag Ghaly, the leader of Islamist group Ansar Dine, at the center.
The video also featured representatives of Al-Mourabitoun—an Al-Qaeda splinter led by Algerian jihadi Mokhtar Belmokhtar—and the so-called Sahara branch of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which is Al-Qaeda’s official affiliate in the region, according to ANI.
In an audio excerpt, Ag Ghaly pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda’s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian militant who led Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) until his death in 2006.
AQI later evolved into the Islamic State militant group (ISIS).
