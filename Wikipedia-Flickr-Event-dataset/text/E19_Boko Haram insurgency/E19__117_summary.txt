ON SATURDAY evening, carloads of Boko Haram insurgents descended on the northern Nigerian village of Dalori, where they set fire to houses, shot residents, and detonated bombs amid fleeing crowds.
One security expert with links to Nigeria’s intelligence services says that more than a hundred militants may have been involved in the raid.
Yet soldiers based in Maiduguri allowed Boko Haram to pillage Dalori for hours before driving them out.
In the past few months both the former national-security adviser and an ex-minister of defence have been arrested on charges of looting funds meant for the fight against Boko Haram.
Mr Buhari thinks that Boko Haram is “technically defeated” because it holds little in the way of land.
