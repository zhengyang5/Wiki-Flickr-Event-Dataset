*These are preliminary estimates that will be subject to review in the context of the finalisation of IDMC's 2016 yearly report on internal displacement, to be published in May 2016.
The DTM teams were composed of IOM staff, members of NEMA, the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Nigerian Red Cross Society and humanitarian partners on the field.
The displacement assessments were conducted with key informants from LGAs, wards and IDP sites (both in official camps and camp-like settings), as well as people in host communities.
Of the total figure of IDPs, the assessment indicates that 12.6 per cent were displaced due to communal clashes, 2.4 per cent by natural disasters and 85 per cent as a result of insurgency attacks by Islamists.
Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations of the source information described above, IDMC believes this to be the best data and is grateful to the partners for sharing it.
