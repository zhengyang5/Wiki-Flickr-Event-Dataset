The military said the girls and women were freed during major operations ending in the seizure of four Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa Forest.
In recent months Nigerian security forces have taken back most of the territory previously under the control of Boko Haram, the BBC's Tomi Oladipo reports from Lagos.
Last October, the government said it had secured an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of the girls taken from Chibok, but Boko Haram subsequently denied this.
Inevitably the world wants to know if the Chibok girls are part of the group.
For the Chibok girls' relatives, the emotional rollercoaster continues.
