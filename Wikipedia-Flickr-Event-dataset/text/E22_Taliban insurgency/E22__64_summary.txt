More than 1,300 foreign troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 Four US soldiers have been killed by a bomb in southern Afghanistan, a Nato spokesman has said.
Brig Gen Eric Tremblay said they were struck "while patrolling in one of the most violent areas of Afghanistan", but did not give an exact location.
The deaths bring the number of foreign forces killed in Afghanistan in 2009 to 295, the deadliest year since the US-led invasion to overthrow the Taliban.
At least 63 foreign military personnel have been killed this month, including 37 Americans.
"Afghanistan is very vulnerable in terms of [the] Taliban and extremists taking over again, and I don't think that threat's going to go away," he told CNN.
