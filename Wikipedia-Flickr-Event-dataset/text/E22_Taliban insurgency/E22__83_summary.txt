PARIS - Two French Foreign Legion soldiers were among four NATO troops killed Sunday in two separate insurgent attacks in Afghanistan, the French presidency said.
The French soldiers were killed in the Tagab valley in Kapisa province north of Kabul, it said.
Their deaths brought to 72 the number of French soldiers who have died in Afghanistan since 2001.
The latest fatalities bring to 383 the number of foreign soldiers killed so far this year, against 711 for the whole of last year, according to the independent website icasualties.org.
The US has already started drawing down its troops in a process that will see Afghan security forces taking over all security responsibilities from foreign forces by 2014.
