Deadly Taliban onslaught near Australian baseUpdatedAustralian troops were called in to help evacuate casualties after insurgents launched a coordinated assault on key buildings in the southern Afghan city of Tarin Kowt.
Insurgents armed with automatic weapons and wearing vests strapped with explosives attacked the governor's office and the police chief's building in the city, which is less than 5 kilometres from the main Australian base in Afghanistan.
The Australian base at Tarin Kowt is on heightened alert as a precaution.
"The base is safe and the base was safe earlier today," Colonel Bob Akam, the commander of Combined Task Force Uruzgan, said.
One of the bombers blew himself up; another suicide bomber detonated his explosives when he was shot by Afghan troops.
