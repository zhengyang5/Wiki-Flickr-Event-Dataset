The bomber struck about 10 a.m., and U.S. military officials declared a "red alert" at the sprawling Bagram Air Base while Cheney was rushed to a bomb shelter.
"I heard a loud boom," Cheney told reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to Oman.
Striking at Bagram with a suicide bomber, I suppose, is one way to do that.
"We knew that Dick Cheney would be staying inside the base," Ahmadi told The Associated Press by telephone from an undisclosed location.
Karzai's office said Cheney told Afghan leaders the United States "will continue its assistance to Afghanistan."
