However, we did not reach our goal in bringing peace to our people, which was and is our biggest hope.
War and instability are out of norm, which is why we always try using all of our resources to bring peace.It was our hope and it is our hope to bring peace to our people.
Undoubtedly, our brother country, Pakistan has supported the peace in Afghanistan and we hope the Pakistani government will support the peace process.
Beside all this destruction, misery and misfortune that has engulfed Pakistan and Afghanistan, terrorism is being used as a weapon.
