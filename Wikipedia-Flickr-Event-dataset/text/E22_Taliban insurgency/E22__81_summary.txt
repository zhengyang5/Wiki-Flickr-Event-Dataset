KABUL, Afghanistan — A bomb attack on a patrol killed two NATO soldiers and five Afghan soldiers on Friday evening, in an impoverished area of eastern Afghanistan where the Afghan government has little presence and where there have not previously been many lethal attacks on soldiers.
The explosion, at dusk in a mountainous area of Paktia Province’s eastern Zurmat district, also wounded two Afghan soldiers and a NATO interpreter, according to a NATO spokesman.
Although Paktia is one of three provinces where the Haqqani network, a particularly brutal insurgent group that is now based across the border in Pakistan, is active, local elders said this attack was staged by local Taliban who are angry at the government.
The Taliban took responsibility for the attack, said Zabiullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman for the east and north of the country.
The three earlier American deaths also occurred in Zurmat district; three Afghan soldiers died in that attack as well, according to Afghan security officials.
