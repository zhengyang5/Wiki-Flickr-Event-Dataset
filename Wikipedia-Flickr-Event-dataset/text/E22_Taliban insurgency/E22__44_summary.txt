As part of a special report called “Life, Death and the Taliban,” GlobalPost traced a web of financial connections between major international contractors and the Taliban in which the insurgents provide protection — largely from themselves — in return for a healthy cut of the proceeds.
As GlobalPost reported, the Taliban allegedly receives kickbacks from almost every major contract that comes into the country.
The arrangements are at times highly formalized and, as GlobalPost spelled out, the Taliban actually keeps an office in Kabul to review major deals, determine percentages and conduct negotiations.
U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke has recently asked the Treasury Department to look into the matter of Taliban funding, and has stated publicly that opium and heroin most likely account for far less of the Taliban budget than had previously been thought.
“But they are not using it to buy guns to kill our soldiers.”As the largest international donor, the United States is the major source of such funding, but it is by no means the only one.
