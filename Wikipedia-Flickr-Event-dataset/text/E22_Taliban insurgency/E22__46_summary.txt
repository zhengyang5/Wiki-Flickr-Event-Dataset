KABUL (Reuters) - Pakistani military intelligence not only funds and trains Taliban fighters in Afghanistan but is officially represented on the movement’s leadership council, giving it significant influence over operations, a report said.
More than 1,800 foreign troops, including some 1,100 Americans, have died in Afghanistan since U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban in late 2001.
Almost all of the Taliban commanders interviewed in the report believed the ISI was represented on the Quetta Shura, the Taliban’s supreme leadership council based in Pakistan.
“(This) suggests that the policy is approved at the highest level of Pakistan’s civilian government,” the report said.
Afghanistan has also been highly critical of Pakistan’s ISI involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan.
