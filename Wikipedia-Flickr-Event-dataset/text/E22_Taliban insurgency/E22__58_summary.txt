CNN's Anderson Cooper, at the scene of the attack, said: "This is a real sign of a resurgence of the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan.
The bombing was the second of the week in the Afghan capital directed at forces of the U.S.-led coalition.
In southern Afghanistan, NATO have been fighting the resurgent Taliban for months, with both militants and troops sustaining many casualties.
There are about 19,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan, and 6,000 are in the south.
Presently, in Kandahar province in the south, Canadian forces are leading a fight against Taliban militants in Operation Medusa, an offensive targeting the Taliban that began last Saturday.
