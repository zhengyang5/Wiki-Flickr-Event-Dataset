Amnesty International said Tuesday that the Taliban and other insurgent groups should be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes

In the wake of the release of a United Nations report outlining an increase in civilian targeted killings in Afghanistan by anti-government forces, Amnesty International called for the Taliban and other insurgent groups to be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes.

"The Taliban and other insurgents are becoming far bolder in their systematic killing of civilians. Targeting of civilians is a war crime, plain and simple," said Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Director, Sam Zarifi.

"The Afghan people are crying out for justice and have a right to accountability and compensation," he added.

Amnesty International said it received reports that tribal elders in Kandahar, Zabul and Khost provinces have been fleeing the areas fearing to become the Taliban's targets.

The mounting civilian casualties caused by foreign troops in Afghanistan have also become a controversial issue, intensified by the last month's disclosure of thousands of secret documents about the Afghan war on the WikiLeaks website.

The WikiLeak's materials supported allegations that Afghan civilian casualties were substantially higher than reported by the Pentagon.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a press release on Tuesday that foreign and Afghan forces have caused 29 percent fewer casualties in 2010 than in 2009, while anti-government forces have caused most casualties in Afghanistan since the start of this year.

A report published by Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) on Sunday said that 1325 Afghans were killed in conflicts in Afghanistan this year, of which 895 were caused by anti-government forces.
