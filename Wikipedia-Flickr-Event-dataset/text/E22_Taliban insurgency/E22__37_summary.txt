The Obama administration is pressing Pakistan to help the U.S. fight the Haqqani insurgent network after last week's attacks on the American embassy and NATO headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan.
U.S. officials say Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told her Pakistani counterpart, Hina Rabbani Khar, that the Taliban and Al Qaeda-affiliated militants must be dealt with.
They say Khar agreed with Clinton that the Haqqani network was a threat to Americans and Pakistanis alike.
Clinton met Khar on Sunday in New York, a day after the U.S. ambassador to Islamabad cited evidence linking the network to the Pakistani government.
The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan said Wednesday the Pakistani-based Haqqani network is behind the coordinated attack against the American Embassy and NATO headquarters in the heart of Kabul.
