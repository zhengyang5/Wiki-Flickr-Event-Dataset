US money ended up in Taliban hands: reportJul 24, 2011 0 (AFP) –WASHINGTON — US government funds earmarked ostensibly to promote business in Afghanistan have landed in Taliban hands under a $2.16 billion transportation contract, The Washington Post has reported.
Moreover, the Pentagon extended the contract for six months last March, the report said.
The investigation found "documented, credible evidence ... of involvement in a criminal enterprise or support for the enemy" by four of the eight prime contractors, the paper noted.
The trucking subcontractors then made deposits into an Afghan National Police commander?s account, already swollen with payments from other subcontractors, in exchange for guarantees of safe passage for the convoys, the report said.
"This goes beyond our comprehension," The Post quoted Representative John Tierney as saying.
