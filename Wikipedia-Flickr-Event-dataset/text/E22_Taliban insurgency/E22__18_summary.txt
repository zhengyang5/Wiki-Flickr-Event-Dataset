Dissid­ent Taliba­n launch parall­el Shura to elect Mullah Omar’s succes­sorISLAMABAD: Mullah Abdul Manan, brother of deceased Taliban supremo Mullah Omar, on Sunday rejected the election of Mullah Akhtar Mansoor as the new chief of the orthodox militia and refused to pledge allegiance to him.
The statement came a day after Mullah Mansoor, in an audio message, called for unity within Taliban ranks to ‘defeat the enemy’.
Former Taliban minister Mutasim Agha Jan, who had been close to Mullah Omar, confirmed it was Mullah Manan’s voice.
“We also want Islamic scholars to resolve the differences rather than siding with anyone or declaring allegiance to any side,” Mullah Omar’s brother said.
The controversial Taliban supremo, Mullah Mansoor, has said that he has been elected by the leadership council and Islamic scholars, dispelling the impression that he was imposed on the movement.
