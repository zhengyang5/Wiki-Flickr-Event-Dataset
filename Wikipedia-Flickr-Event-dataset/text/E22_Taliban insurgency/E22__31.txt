KABUL: Ministry of Defense on Tuesday said that at least 2,853 Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers have lost their lives in the line of duty over the past 11 years.

The MoD spokesman, Gen. Zahir Azimi, wrote on Twitter that 2013 was the deadliest year for the ANA. He said that as many as 1,392 soldiers were killed in the past year while fighting against anti-Afghanistan elements.

The steady increase in casualties has come after completion of security transition to Afghan forces as nine soldiers had been killed in 2003, 51 in 2004, 138 in 2005, 206 in 2007, 325 in 2007 and 380 in 2008.

The annual death toll swelled to 635 in 2009, 748 in 2010, 831 in 2011, 1170 in 2012, and 1,392 last year.

Itâ€™s worth mentioning that 950 ANA soldiers have been mowed down in six months of current year.

The complete transfer of security responsibilities from NATO to Afghan forces can be taken as a sole reason behind steady rise in the Afghan forces casualties, an Afghan analyst said.

The improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that Taliban have picked up as weapon to target Afghan and foreign security forces are believe to be a major contributor to ANA casualties.
