Turban bomber kills Kandahar mayor in troubled Afghan southJul 27, 2011 0 By Mamoon Durrani (AFP) –KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — The mayor of Kandahar, a close ally of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, was assassinated in a suicide attack Wednesday -- the latest in a string of political murders in the key southern region.
The suicide bomber detonated explosives hidden in his turban and killed mayor Ghulam Haidar Hameedi, who was talking to locals in the courtyard of Kandahar's city hall, police chief Abdul Razeq told AFP.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing, saying that a volunteer suicide attacker had come forward after the deaths of the children.
Karzai condemned the killing of his ally, who had a rare reputation for resisting corruption in the volatile region.
Seven parts of the country were ceremonially handed over to Afghan forces last week.
