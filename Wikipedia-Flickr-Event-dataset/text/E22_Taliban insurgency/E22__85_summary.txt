â€” Taliban insurgents beheaded 17 Afghans in a rebel-controlled area of southern Afghanistan, officials said Monday, and two NATO troops were killed by an Afghan soldier in the eastern part of the country.
A Taliban spokesman denied that the group was involved and said local commanders in the area knew nothing about the killings, news agencies reported.
They did not identify the nationality of the foreign troops, but most of those stationed in the east are Americans.
The deaths bring to 12 the number of foreign troops killed this month, mostly on joint bases, by Afghan military men.
Although insider attacks have largely targeted foreign troops, Afghan forces in recent months have suffered losses from similar strikes.
