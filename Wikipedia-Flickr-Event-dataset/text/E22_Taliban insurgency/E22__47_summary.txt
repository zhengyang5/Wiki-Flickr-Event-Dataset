The ISI is widely thought to have played a key role in creating the Afghan Taliban during the 1990s, but Pakistan officially denies supporting them now.
The title comes from Taliban commanders' claims that their relationship with Pakistani intelligence is "as clear as the sun in the sky."
"Has he named any Taliban commanders in this, has he named any officials?"
And southern Taliban commanders all complained of heavy ISI involvement, which they blamed for some attacks on civilians.
Waldman's report comes two months after a U.N. report on the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007 -- an attack blamed on Pakistani Taliban leaders -- found that intelligence agencies hindered the subsequent investigation.
