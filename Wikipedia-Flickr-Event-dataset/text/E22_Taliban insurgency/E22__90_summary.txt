In Baghlan Province, the southeastern district of Tala Wa Barfak fell to the Taliban on Thursday.
So far, however, American officials have ruled out sending any large number of troops to help Afghans in the north.
The Taliban interest in Kunduz and Takhar has its roots not only in the movement’s decades-long presence in the region, but also in economics.
By day’s end it was hard to say that either the government or the Taliban controlled Kunduz, but the government appeared to be making headway.
Residents reached in parts of Kunduz Province beyond the city said that the Taliban remained in control in the district of Chardara.
