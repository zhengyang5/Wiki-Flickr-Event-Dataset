Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) demonstrated in a more than impressive way this week how science and technology can advance the cause of human rights.
Here's a quick summary of the story:In 2002, PHR investigators discovered the presence of a mass grave site in Dasht-e-Leili, outside of the city of Sheberghan in northern Afghanistan.
The grave site is reported to contain anywhere from hundreds to thousands of Taliban prisoners of war.
To gather additional evidence, PHR requested satellite imagery from the area, which showed two sizeable pits, compromising the original area.
The satellite imagery obtained by the AAAS indicated that there was earth-moving equipment present on August 5, 2006 along with one of two new pits.
