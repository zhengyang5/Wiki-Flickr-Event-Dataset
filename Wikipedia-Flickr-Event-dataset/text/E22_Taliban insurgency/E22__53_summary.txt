Afghan civilian deaths up 15%KABUL â€” The number of civilians killed in the Afghan war in the first half of 2011 rose 15 percent, the United Nations said Thursday, putting the year on track to be the deadliest in a decade.
"A shift in the tactics of anti-government elements increased the severity of (their) attacks on Afghan civilians," the country's UN human rights director Georgette Gagnon told a press conference in Kabul.
The United Nations "documented 1,462 civilian deaths in the first six months of 2011, an increase of 15 percent over the same period in 2010."
The Taliban were responsible for the vast majority of civilian casualties in an increase of more 28 percent on last year.
"What we need from them is a factual change or in other words a reduction of indiscriminate civilian casualties," he said at the press conference.
