Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Militants launched rocket attacks against an eastern Afghan provincial capital Tuesday, just as a NATO handover ceremony to Afghan security forces in the province of Laghman was under way.
Lashkar Gah is the capital of Helmand province, a southern border region that was the scene of fierce fighting between coalition and Taliban forces last year.
The city is widely considered the most volatile of the first seven areas to be transferred to Afghan control.
Elsewhere in the country, two International Assistance Security Force service members died following an improvised explosive device (IED) attack in eastern Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, Afghan authorities uncovered a vehicle packed with 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds) of explosives in the country's southwestern province of Farah.
