Khar's comments were first aired in Pakistan on Friday.
The Pakistani officials were responding to congressional testimony by the top U.S. military officer about Pakistan.
Pakistan is "exporting violence" and threatening any success in Afghanistan, Mullen told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Mullen did not provide specific evidence backing up his accusations or indicate what the U.S. would do if Pakistan refuses to cut ties to the Haqqani network.
But his comments could make that engagement harder and continue a recent downward trend in ties between the two countries.
