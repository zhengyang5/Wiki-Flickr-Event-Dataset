President Obama and other leaders in Washington sent their condolences to the families of 31 U.S. special operation troops who were killed Saturday when their helicopter crashed -- likely shot down by insurgents over eastern Afghanistan.
Most of them were part of the elite Navy SEALs unit that killed Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden.
None of those who died in the crash had participated in the bin Laden raid, a senior U.S. military official told Fox News.
Obama said their deaths are a reminder of the "extraordinary" price the U.S. military is paying in the decade-long Afghan war.
Today, on the deadliest day for American forces since the war in Afghanistan began, we are reminded of the service and sacrifice of our troops."
