Witnesses said a four-hour battle began with a car bombing and included suicide bombers and Taliban fighters throwing grenades.
The Taliban claimed responsibility and Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, said the attacks appeared to be aimed at Indian government officials and medical workers.
Three Afghan police were killed, and six more officers were among the 38 people wounded in what was described as a well-planned and co-ordinated attack.
Abdul Rahman Rahman, chief of Kabul police, said a car bomb began the attack, levelling the Arya Guesthouse, popular with Indian doctors working at the city's Indira Gandhi Child Health Institute.
The high-rise, glass-fronted Safi Landmark hotel next door was badly damaged by the blasts and broken windows littered the streets.
