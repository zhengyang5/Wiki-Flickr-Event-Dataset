A spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, Gen. Dawlat Waziri, responding to the cabinet report, confirmed on Monday that 4,551 Afghan soldiers had been killed through March 20, 2013.
While there was as yet no complete breakdown year by year, there is little doubt that most of the increase in Afghan casualties occurred during the past three years.
Before 2010, both police and military casualties were relatively few, reflecting the small size of the Afghan security forces, and the higher proportion of the fighting carried out by NATO and American troops.
For instance, in 2009, roughly twice as many coalition soldiers were killed as Afghan soldiers, based on data compiled by the Brookings Institution and icasualties.org, a website that collects data on war casualties.
According to the compilations by Brookings, only 1,236 Afghan soldiers and 3,290 Afghan police officers were killed from 2007 to 2010.
