The MoD spokesman, Gen. Zahir Azimi, wrote on Twitter that 2013 was the deadliest year for the ANA.
He said that as many as 1,392 soldiers were killed in the past year while fighting against anti-Afghanistan elements.
Itâ€™s worth mentioning that 950 ANA soldiers have been mowed down in six months of current year.
The complete transfer of security responsibilities from NATO to Afghan forces can be taken as a sole reason behind steady rise in the Afghan forces casualties, an Afghan analyst said.
The improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that Taliban have picked up as weapon to target Afghan and foreign security forces are believe to be a major contributor to ANA casualties.
