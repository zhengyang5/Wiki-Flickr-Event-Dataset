Afghanistan marks 10 years since the start of the US-led war against the Taliban Friday amid heightened security and questions over what the next decade will hold.
"I spent a year in the city of Kabul during the Taliban regime and they made life difficult as they banned everything.
Around 200 Afghans called for the withdrawal of foreign troops and shouted anti-American slogans at a protest in Kabul Thursday ahead of the anniversary.
The war was launched to oust the Taliban for harbouring Osama bin Laden, leader of Al-Qaeda which was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, and destroy Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan.
Experts argue that the 10th anniversary finds Afghanistan at a key turning point.
