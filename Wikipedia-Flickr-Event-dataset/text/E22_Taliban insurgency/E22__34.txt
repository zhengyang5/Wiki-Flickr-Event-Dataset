WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Iran continues to provide weapons and training to the Taliban in Afghanistan, the U.S. military said on Tuesday.

The Pentagon also said in a periodic report to Congress that while NATO cooperation with Pakistanâ€™s military had improved, Taliban safe havens along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border remained an obstacle to overall security.
