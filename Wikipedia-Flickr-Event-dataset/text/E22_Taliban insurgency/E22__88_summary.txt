Afghan officials blamed the massacre on Sunni Taliban insurgents, who are battling Afghan and foreign troops.
“The Taliban wants to divide Afghans along ethnic and sectarian lines,” said Sayed Nader Shah Bahr, a parliament member from Ghowr.
Ethnic Hazaras, the majority of whom are Shiite Muslims, make up a sizable portion of Ghowr’s population of about 580,000, according to Afghan government statistics.
When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, its forces carried out sectarian killings of the Hazara population.
The Taliban, which subscribes to an austere form of Sunni Islam, says adherents of the Shiite sect are infidels, or nonbelievers.
