The seven militants who carried out the attack died; five were gunned down and two killed themselves.
“They told us to get out, and then they went to the roof and started firing.”The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
In October, militants wearing suicide belts attacked a United Nations guesthouse in Kabul and killed eight people, including five of the organization’s workers.
Within minutes, hundreds of Afghan commandos, soldiers and police officers surrounded Pashtunistan Square and attacked.
One group of Afghan commandos said they had come straight from a training class.
