Fort McKay sits about 65 kilometres north of Fort McMurray and its only road south, Hwy 63, has been blocked as a result of a wildfire that has bloomed to 85,000 hectares burning about 80 kilometres south of the First Nation.
“The fire is headed in the other direction.”The community of 800 people saw its population quintuple following an evacuation of Fort McMurray on Tuesday.
The fires have now spread over 85,000 hectares and provincial officials still have no idea on a return-home date for the 88,000 people evacuated since Tuesday from Fort McMurray, Fort McMurray First Nation, Anzac and Gregoire Lake Estates.
