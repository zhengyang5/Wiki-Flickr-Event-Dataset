Two explosions within Fort McMurray damaged 10 homes and poor air quality forced staff who were working to clean the hospital and natural gas utility workers to leave, she said.
But late Monday about 8,000 people working at camps north of Fort McMurray were ordered out in a mandatory evacuation due to the fast-moving fire.
The evacuation zone, stretching about 50 km north of Fort McMurray to just south of Fort MacKay, included Syncrude and Suncor facilities, along with several smaller operations.
Notley said the focus of firefighting efforts Tuesday would be protecting other work camps.
The entire population of Fort McMurray, more than 80,000 residents, are now entering their third week away from home after a wildfire spread into the oilsands city on May 3.
