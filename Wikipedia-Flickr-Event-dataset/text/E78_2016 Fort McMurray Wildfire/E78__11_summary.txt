The Ryan family would gladly let the fire take their Fort McMurray home, if it meant getting back what the fire already took â€” Emily.
"Ultimately, it's still a shock, the grief comes in waves," said Chelsi, Emily Ryan's sister.
On Wednesday Emily Ryan, 15, was like many others, forced to flee Fort McMurray.
Almost any dollar Emily was able to scrounge would go toward putting a new book on her shelf, Chelsi said.
The fire in Fort McMurray has forced 80,000 from their homes and still rages on.
