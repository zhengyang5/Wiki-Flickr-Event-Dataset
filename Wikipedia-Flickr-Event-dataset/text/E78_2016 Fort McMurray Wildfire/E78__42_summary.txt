Late Wednesday night, the regional municipality announced a mandatory evacuation of the communities of Anzac, Gregoire Lake Estates and Fort McMurray First Nation – which lie roughly 50 kilometres south of Fort McMurray.
“We have basically two things that we have to do,” she later told CTV Edmonton from Anzac, where many Fort McMurray residents were staying temporarily.
Jean, who leads the Wildrose Party, later told CTV’s Power Play he wants to focus on making sure that everyone leaves Fort McMurray immediately.
“The fires that are surrounding Fort McMurray right now could go in any direction,” he said.
