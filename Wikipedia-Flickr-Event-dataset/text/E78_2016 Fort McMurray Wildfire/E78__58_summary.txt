The fire-damaged city of Fort McMurray in northern Alberta is getting a visit from Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, on Friday.
Sophie will then head to Edmonton and Fort McMurray, while Edward has more private meetings in Regina before going to Calgary.
The governor general said in a news release that he and Sophie are looking forward to meeting first responders, volunteers and residents affected by the Fort McMurray fire.
"They all have shown tremendous courage and resilience throughout this devastating disaster," the governor general said in the release.
"Our visit to Fort McMurray will allow us to show our ongoing support and to recognize so many great Canadians for their outstanding work."
