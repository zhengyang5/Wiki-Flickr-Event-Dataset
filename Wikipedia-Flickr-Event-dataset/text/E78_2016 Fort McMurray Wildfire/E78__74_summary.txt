A combination of dry conditions and intense lightning storms in June 2008 started 1,700 fires in California that cost the state more than $100 million to extinguish.
Alberta’s weather conditions nudged the fire season two weeks earlier than usual, said Judith Kulig, a professor of health services at the University of Lethbridge in the province.
That’s got people asking whether climate change is playing a role.
“There have been predictions that, as climate change progresses, there would be more disasters,” said Kulig, who studies the impacts of such events on communities.
In terms of land area, the Fort McMurray fire isn’t particularly large.
