Many evacuees forced from their Fort McMurray homes by wildfire Tuesday are on the move once again.
For Donna Guillamot, evacuated yesterday from Fort McMurray, the feeling is all too familiar.
RCMP went door to door in Anzac, Gregoire Lake Estates and Fort McMurray First Nation after a mandatory evacuation order was issued.
Anzac has a population of 714, Gregoire Lake Estates 79 and Fort McMurray First Nation about 700 â€” the populations are likely much higher due to the number of Fort McMurray evacuees staying in the communities.
All commercial flights into Fort McMurray International Airport remained suspended.
