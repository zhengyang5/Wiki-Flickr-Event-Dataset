Capital Region Housing Corporation, the City of Edmonton, the Alberta Residential Landlord Association and Yardi Canada Ltd. have come together and produced a central housing registry through RentCafe.
An online housing registry, through Rentcafe.ca, has been set up to help Fort McMurray residents displaced by the wildfire find housing.
- Greg Dewling, CEO of Capital Region Housing CorporationThe hope is the registry will help displaced families quickly find "a temporary place to call home," Dewling said.
Yardi Canada pulled together an international team of staff to create and launch the housing registry in under 72 hours, says Peter Altobelli.
The registry service is being offered by Yardi Canada Ltd. for six months, free of charge.
