Guy Jette, manager of Fort McMurray's water treatment plant, remembers the 'crazy hours and stress level' as he and his team battled to push more water out to firefighters as the wildfire raged.
Fort McMurray's water treatment facility is three years old, and while it had four newly installed filters that could more than double the water output, the equipment hadn't yet been fully commissioned.
Jette started up new filters inside the water treatment plant to more than double the amount of water pushed out to fight the wildfire.
As they battled to get as much water to the fire crews as they could, firefighters were working to protect the water treatment plant itself.
