The province's plan calls for residents to begin returning to the city on June 1.
"This is part of the plan to ensure there are basic amenities such as grocery stores and pharmacies up and running when residents return."
"As a precautionary measure, ATCO has shut off the gas at the meter to all homes and businesses in Fort McMurray," Larivee said.
"As residents and businesses return, they can request ATCO to come to each location, do a gas-safety inspection at the property, turn on the service and help to relight each appliance."
Officials say they expect there will be smoke damage in some homes, perhaps water damage as well.
