The wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta, have already forced 80,000 people out of their homes, after a mandatory evacuation order was issued.
"It was kind of like Armageddon," describes Dam Smith, who moved with his family to the northern Alberta city three years ago.
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said an estimated 1,600 structures have already been lost to the fire.
Several RCMP-led convoys have led evacuees in cars south through Fort McMurray, giving residents a drive-by glimpse of the scorched town which was once their home.
Many communities in towns surrounding Fort McMurray are offering shelter and food for the families displaced by the fire.
