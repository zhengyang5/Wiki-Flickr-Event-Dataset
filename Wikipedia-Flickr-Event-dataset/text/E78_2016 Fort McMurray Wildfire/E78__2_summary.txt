Six months after it sent the population of Fort McMurray fleeing, the wildfire known as MWF-009 is still burning.
“Just given the size, scope and complexity of the Fort McMurray wildfire, firefighters will continue to monitor the area,” said Laura Stewart, Wildfire Information Officer with the Government of Alberta.
Known by firefighters as the Horse River Fire, it is so named because the fire began May 1 near a small waterway known as Horse River.
Just two hectares in size when it was first spotted, it only took three days to expand into 10,000 hectares and swoop into Fort McMurray.
After the fire had crossed the border into Saskatchewan, it was hammered by a string of summer rains that would also bring flooding to the fire-beleaguered residents of Fort McMurray.
