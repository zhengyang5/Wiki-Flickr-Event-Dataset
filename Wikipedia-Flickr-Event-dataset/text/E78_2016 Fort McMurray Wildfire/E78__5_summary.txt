Diego Romero, CTV EdmontonThe Insurance Bureau of Canada said Thursday that the damage caused by the Fort McMurray wildfires reached an estimate of $3.58 billion, making it the largest insured catastrophe in Canadian history.
The second most expensive natural catastrophe in this country’s history came in 2013, also in Alberta, when insurance costs in the southern Alberta floods were 1.7 billion.
“As a country, we need to take a more disciplined and sustained approach to helping prepare Canadians for fires and floods,” Forgeron said.
“We must build a more resilient country to better protect those affected by the very real impacts of our changing climate.
By taking action now, we can minimize costs to taxpayers and better equip homeowners for the risks and challenges that lie ahead."
