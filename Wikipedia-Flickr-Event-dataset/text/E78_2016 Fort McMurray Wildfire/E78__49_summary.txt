Watch as 300 South African firefighters sing, dance on their way to Fort McMurray (AP Video)The firefighters arrived in Canada last month, singing and dancing as they landed at Edmonton airport, gaining media attention across Canada and internationally.
This is in addition to their accommodation and other expenses, and their regular South African wages, which are as little as $200 a month.
The dispute began just north of Fort McMurray when a team of 60 South African firefighters met with one of their managers on Tuesday morning.
On the first issue, the South African firefighters want to receive the entire daily allowance during their deployment.
He said the Canadian officials had requested that the South African firefighters receive a wage similar to Canadian firefighters.
