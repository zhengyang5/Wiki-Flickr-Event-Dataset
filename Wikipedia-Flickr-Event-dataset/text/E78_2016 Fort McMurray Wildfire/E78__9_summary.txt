The Fort McMurray wildfire, which forced the largest evacuation in Alberta's history and consumed more than 2,400 structures and nearly 600,000 hectares of forest, is now classified as under control.
Cooler temperatures, rain and firefighting efforts combined to bring the fire to heel, wildfire information officer Laura Stewart said Tuesday.
The wildfire hazard in the Fort McMurray region is now classified as low.
On May 3, it entered Fort McMurray, forcing a mass evacuation of the city's 80,000 residents.
At its peak, the fire moved at 30 to 40 metres per minute and created its own weather patterns.
