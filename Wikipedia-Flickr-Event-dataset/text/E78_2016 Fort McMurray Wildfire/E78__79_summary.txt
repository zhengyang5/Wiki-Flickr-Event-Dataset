Unless fire hazards or other logistical setbacks intervene, Fort McMurray will be repopulated starting June 1, Premier Rachel Notley announced on May 18.
There will be a light haze and perhaps a mildly toxic odour throughout Fort McMurray.
Safety fencing will be everywhere, kilometres of it snaking all over Fort McMurray.
Schools in Fort McMurray, though they’re all still standing, won’t resume classes until September, though all students will be advanced to the next grade.
As Notley had warned, Fort McMurray is, in the early days, a city of basic services.
