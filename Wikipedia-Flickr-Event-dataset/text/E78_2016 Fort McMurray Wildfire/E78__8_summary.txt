The Canadian PressEDMONTON -- A provincial state of emergency declared over a raging wildfire in northern Alberta nearly two months ago has finally been lifted.
A provincewide state of emergency has been declared only once before in Alberta, during the floods of 2013.
"We are confident that a Provincial State of Emergency is no longer required in order for the municipality to continue this important work.
Alberta will continue to stand with the people of Fort McMurray as they rebuild their homes and community."
The Fort McMurray Cancer Centre still isn't opened but that process is scheduled to begin July 11.
