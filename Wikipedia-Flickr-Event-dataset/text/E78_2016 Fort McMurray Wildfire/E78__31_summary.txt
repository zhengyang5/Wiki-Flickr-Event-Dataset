Firefighting crews are about to face the worst time of day for fire conditions, said Alberta Wildfire spokesperson Chad Morrison.
The conditions will continue to challenge fire crews working in the forest, but he expects fire crews to battle the blaze "for months to come."
Larivee thanked the hamlet of Fort McKay, 60 kilometres north of Fort McMurray, for its "herculean" efforts to assist thousands of Fort McMurray evacuees, but it was now facing a voluntary evacuation notice.
"We are very proud that the firefighters in the Fort McMurray area have held the line," Long said.
"The good news is, it continues to move away from [Fort McMurray]," Morrison said.
