The AFD petroleum facility, located roughly five kilometres northwest of Noralta Lodge outside of Fort McMurray, is pictured on Tuesday afternoon.
(Name withheld by request) Officials said the fire was expected to move east on Tuesday and would likely jump Highway 63 south of Noralta Lodge.
They had started bulldozing trees and brush to make wide fire breaks just days after the first fires hit Fort McMurray.
NASA's Suomi NPP satellite collected images of what its office called "the myriad of fires in the Fort McMurray complex" on May 16.
