Planning is under way to allow evacuated Fort McMurray residents back home, but it's unclear how long it will be before advances in fighting a massive wildfire opens the door to their return, a senior Alberta fire official said Saturday.
"There is no time limit established yet on a re-entry, but re-entry planning has started," he said.
Officials continue to hope a shift in weather will help, but Chad Morrison, the senior wildfire manager for Alberta, said it would take 100 millimetres of rain to make a difference.
Mr. Morrison traced the fire over the past 24 hours, suggesting it was just over 100,000 hectares on Friday and gained 50,000 hectares by nightfall.
However, he said officials expect the fire to reach between 250,000 to 300,000 hectares by day's end on Saturday.
