It's estimated 100 stations are dry in Western Canada, including many in Kelowna, Kamloops, Merritt, Vernon and Penticton.
McTeague does not believe overreaction or panic by the public is behind the additional stations out in the Okanagan.
â€œThere is no doubt that there is a serious supply shortage and that won't be solved until things are fixed or mended in Edmonton.
McTeague stands by his statement last week that a lot of what happens in our markets in Western Canada is controlled by the Chicago market.
