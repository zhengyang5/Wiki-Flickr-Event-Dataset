A new park is planned in memory of a young woman who was killed while fleeing the Fort McMurray wildfire last spring.
(David Thurton/CBC)During those frenzied two days, Emily and Aaron moved from one Fort McMurray subdivision to another.
Eventually they made it to Conklin, 150 kilometres south of Fort McMurray, where volunteers welcomed them with a barbecue.
Although no one died during the wildfire, many in Fort McMurray consider Emily and Aaron casualties of one of Canada's largest evacuations.
Family and friends hope the park will be in the Fort McMurray community of Beacon Hill, one of the areas hardest hit by the fire.
