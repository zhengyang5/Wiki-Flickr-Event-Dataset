UPDATE: One year after breaking out, the Fort McMurray wildfire is still considered an “active fire” by officials in Alberta, despite the cold weather and snow that swept through the region over the winter.

“It is a common occurrence on large fires,” said Scott Wasylenchuk, Saskatchewan director of Wildfire Operations.
Pomeroy says that the area burnt was hit so hard it will make it harder for water to seep in, thus making it more difficult to put out.
