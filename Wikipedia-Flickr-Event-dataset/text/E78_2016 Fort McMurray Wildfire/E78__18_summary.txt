Fort McMurray residents are wondering if they will have homes to return to, as the fire that started Sunday quickly overwhelmed firefighters and the city’s resources.
Residents were told to head to the Anzac Recreation Centre, about a one-hour drive south of Fort McMurray.
Highway 63 runs north-south through Fort McMurray and is a main thoroughfare for people heading in and out of town.
All non-essential traffic to Fort McMurray on Highway 63 and Highway 881 was restricted, Alberta Transportation said Tuesday evening.
“All Albertans are watching this, all Albertans are with the people of Fort McMurray,” Notley said.
