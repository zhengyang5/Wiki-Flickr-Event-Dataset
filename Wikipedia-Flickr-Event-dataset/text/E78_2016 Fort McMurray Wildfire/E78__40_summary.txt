The massive wildfire that destroyed much of Fort McMurray last May is still considered under control and contained, but will likely burn underground throughout the winter.
It is the biggest fire in Wood Buffalo since 2011, when the Richardson Fire burned an area of 705,075 hectares.
When a fire burns as long and as intensely as the Fort McMurray one, it is not unusual for the fires to smoulder underground during the winter, feeding on peat and dead vegetation, then return to the surface in the spring.
The wildfire hazard level is classified as low, but forestry workers are warning campers and hunters to make sure campfires are completely extinguished.
Anyone using off-road vehicles should be wary of the temperatures of their vehicles.
