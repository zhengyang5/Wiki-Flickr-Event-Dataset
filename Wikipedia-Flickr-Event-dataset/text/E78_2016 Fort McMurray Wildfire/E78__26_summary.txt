(CNN) Wildfires such as the one raging in California, can become hot enough to produce rare mushroom-cloud like formations known as pyrocumulus clouds.
They tower above the ash and smoke from raging wildfires and are often seen for miles.
Normal cumulus clouds form because the sun's rays heat the ground, forming warm air that rises because it is less dense than the cooler air above.
This additional moisture in the atmosphere condenses in the cooler air above, on smoke particles also produced by the fire.
Evacuees watch the pyrocumulus form above the wildfire near Fort McMurray on May 4.
