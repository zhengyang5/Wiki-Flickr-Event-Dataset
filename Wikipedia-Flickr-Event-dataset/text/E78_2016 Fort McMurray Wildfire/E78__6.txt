She says they had to wait for winter to be over to see if any smoke or heat remained from the massive fire, dubbed “The Beast” because it was so fierce and unpredictable.

Daina says they also used advanced heat detectors from helicopters to ensure there were no remaining hot spots coming from the ground.

“With a fire that size it takes time to make sure it is fully extinguished so we wait for a winters worth of snow and then in the summer we check to see if any smoke pops up and if not we use advanced heat detectors from helicopters and make sure there is no remaining heat,” Daina said.

“Once we determine there is no remaining heat left on the fire, we determine it is extinguished and out.”

The fire caused an estimated $3.8 billion in insured damage.
