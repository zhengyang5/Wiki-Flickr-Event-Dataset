The dry conditions continued through the winter with the western part of Canada then feeling the impact of El Niño.
Scientists say the current El Niño event is one of the strongest on record, with the effects felt all over the world including a reduced monsoon in India and droughts in parts of Africa.
That fingerprint of El Niño saw Fort McMurray record a temperature of 32.6C earlier this week, which is significantly above the normal high temperature for early May of around 14C.
Not local but globalMany researchers believe that El Niño was not the only factor increasing the likelihood of a major fire in Alberta.
Just before the last major El Niño in 1997, the population of Fort McMurray was just over 30,000.
