A wildfire burns as evacuees who were stranded north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada head south of Fort McMurray on Highway 63, May 6, 2016.

The wildfire was taking a toll on the provinceâ€™s economy, with one study estimating the lost oil production would cut gross domestic product (GDP) by more than C$70 million a day.
None of the oil sands have caught fire, and the industry was redoubling efforts to ensure facilities were well-protected, said Alberta wildfire manager Chad Morrison.
The lost Canadian production of 1 million barrels a day represents about one-quarter of total Canadian output.
