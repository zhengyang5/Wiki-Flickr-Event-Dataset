With residents set to start returning to Fort McMurray tomorrow, the premier has announced that hundreds of undamaged homes in neighbourhoods hardest hit by the wildfire are not safe to live in.
Tests done near those homes show ash and soil in the area contain substances like arsenic and other heavy metals.
"If you look at the whole block, our homes look OK," she said.
Rejman said she didn't plan to stay in Fort McMurray in the near future because she has asthma, but she hopes to visit her home next month.
Heavily damaged areas of Fort McMurray have also been closed off with more 30 kilometres of security fencing, the premier said.
