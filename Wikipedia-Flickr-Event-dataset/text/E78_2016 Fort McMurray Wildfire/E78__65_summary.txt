CALGARY â€” Oilsands producers are expected to report back-to-business third-quarter results over the next few days as they shrug off lingering impacts of last May's devastating wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alta.
Its oilsands mining and upgrading operations were shut down due to a fire-related evacuation, although its facilities suffered no damage.
Analysts expect the third-quarter recovery in production will be tempered by a maintenance shutdown at its Kearl oilsands mining operations.
It also launched a sales process for its lubricants business last summer with results expected by year-end.
Husky Energy (TSX:HSE) reports its third-quarter results on Thursday morning and is expected to update output from its 60,000-bpd capacity Sunrise oilsands project.
