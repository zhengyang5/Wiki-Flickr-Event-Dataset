Fire in CanadaType of Event: Fire Location of Event: Alberta, Canada Date of Charter Activation: 4 May 2016 Time of Charter Activation: 01:14:00 Time zone of Charter Activation: UTC+05:00 Charter Requestor: GOC Public Safety Canada Project Management: Canadian Space Agency (CSA)Description of the eventA wildfire in Alberta, Canada, has forced the evacuation of an entire city.
All residents of Fort McMurray, 90,000 people, were given mandatory evacuation orders on 3 May as the fire raged out control in the city.
The sheer number of evacuees has quickly filled emergency shelters and camps nearby, forcing some residents to spread farther out to find a refuge.
It is estimated that it could take weeks to make the city safe for people to return to.
Weather conditions took a more favourable turn on 8 May, with some light rain and a shift in wind, reducing the speed the fire could spread.
