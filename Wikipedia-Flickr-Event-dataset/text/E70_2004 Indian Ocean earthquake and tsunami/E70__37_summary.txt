She says the aboriginal Shompen people, who shun outside world contact, would have been hit hard because their habitat in the Great Nicobar lay in the path of the tsunami.
Great Nicobar suffered badly in the disaster.
Ms Mukherjee says other tribes - the Jarawas, the Sentinelese and Great Andamanese, live on higher ground and may have been safe.
Andaman-based Samir Acharya, who runs the Society for Andaman and Nicobar Ecology, says the tsunami struck at the time of year when the aborigines took to beaches early in the day to hunt turtles.
The turtles come nesting on beaches and the aborigines try to catch them for meat," he says.
