Tsunami waves have a very deep reach indeed - 4000 metres or more.
Fu hopes the observations will improve tsunami warning systems by providing vital new data to calibrate tsunami models.
The key number in the modelling is wave height in deep water, as this indicates energy, and that is exactly what the radar recorded.
"This is the first observation of details of tsunami waves," says Fu.
