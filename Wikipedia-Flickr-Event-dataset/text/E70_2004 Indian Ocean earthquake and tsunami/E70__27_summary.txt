However, observation is difficult, since the additional height is one of the signals of ocean variability.
Until the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004, tsunami observations by satellite altimeters had been relatively insignificant.
The signal was not clearly observed because of its weak amplitude, close to 8 cm, and the great ocean variability in this area.
Altimeter Sea Level Anomalies account for many different ocean signals such as large-scale and mesoscale ocean variability.
It must be noted that satellite altimetry is not sufficient for the early detection and warning of tsunamis.
