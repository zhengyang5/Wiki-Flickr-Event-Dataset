The former publicly charged the home minister with utter irresponsibility, compelling Mr Patil to approach the party high command on the issue.
Mr Patil is learnt to have told Ms Gandhi that his ministry had issued a warning based on inputs received from the S&T ministry.
Mr Sibal has admitted passing on the information, without adding any comments.
Although Mr Sibal has not made any direct comment on Mr Patil, he did say that the advisory was baseless.
Sources said that Mr Patil has raised serious objections over Mr Sibalâs attitude.
