One year after the tsunami, Sri Lankan survivors still live in squalourBy W.A.
The tsunami victims initially received a monthly grant of 5,000 rupees per family to help sustain them, but that has been discontinued.
The high death toll was in large part due to the lack of any tsunami warning system.
A year later there is still no comprehensive tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean.
As social discontent has risen, including among tsunami victims, the ruling elites have deliberately stirred up communal tensions as a diversion.
