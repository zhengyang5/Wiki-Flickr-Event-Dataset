Coccoliths are one of the main components of deep ocean carbonate oozes (Baumann et al., 2004; Ziveri et al., 2004).
Both inflow and outflow produced extensive erosion, sediment transport and deposition until 5 km inland (Umitsu et al., 2006; Wassmer et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2009).

6 – CM patterns and nannolith abundances of the 2004 tsunami deposits in Lhok Nga.
Zoom Original (png, 21k)11The 2004 tsunami deposits in Lhok Nga display abundances in nannoliths that are significantly higher than other coastal deposits, but lower than innershelf deposits.
