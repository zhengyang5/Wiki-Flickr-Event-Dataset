He said another aboriginal people - the Jarawa on South and Middle Andaman - also fled to higher ground before the waves.
"There's clear evidence that the aboriginals know about tsunamis and they know how to deal with them," he said.
He added that the Jarawa tribe along the west coast of South and Middle Andaman Islands was also largely safe.
Many of their islands suffered more in the huge waves - in some cases being washed off the horizon entirely.
