The maximum damage has been in the Nicobar group of Islands and NOT in the Andaman group of islands.
If you look at the map of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands , you will find that Andaman & Nicobar are two completely different group of islands.
The entire Andaman group of islands (excepting Little Andamans) have been literally spared from the devastating Tsunami.
Most importantly there has been no injuries or deaths amongst tourists - since tourists are anyway not allowed to visit the Nicobar group of islands.
The survey showed that the Andaman coral reefs had been hardly affected by coral bleaching that devastated coral reef systems worldwide in 1998.
