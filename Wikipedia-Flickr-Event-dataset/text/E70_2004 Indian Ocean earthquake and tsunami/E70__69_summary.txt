Some Indian Ocean islands could have been made permanently uninhabitable by the salt water that flooded them during the devastating Asian tsunami of 26 December.
It could leave some communities dependent on outside aid for food and water for months or years to come.
Dozens of coral atolls in the Maldive Islands south of India were completely overwhelmed by the waves, which poisoned all of their underground water reserves with salt.
“To treat wells properly, the salt water needs to be pumped out and then the wells should be chlorinated to kill contaminants,” he told New Scientist.
“The fields that these people rely on are beyond use for at least another year or two because they have received so much salt water,” said Gordon Weiss of UNICEF, the UN children’s agency.
