(An international tsunami warning system has existed in the Pacific, where quakes are more common, since the 1940s.)
Following 2004, the Australian Government pumped $68 million in to a warning system for the Indian Ocean, which is a major component of a multi-national Indian Ocean tsunami warning system.
This operates 24 hours-a-day and a tsunami warning coming out the joint tsunami centre takes about 15 minutes.
One of the reasons the 2004 tsunami had such an impact was that the scientific community were caught unawares, says Phil.
But in Australia we now have near real-time coverage of tsunami events says Daniel, who helped to develop the Indian Ocean tsunami warning system.
