The following is a list of some of the worst natural calamities to strike the world since 1900.
This list is also limited to disasters since 1900 — an arbitrary cut-off to be sure — but one made to reflect so-called "modern-day" disasters only.
The 20th century's most devastating quake (magnitude 7.8) hit the sleeping city of Tangshan in northeast China.
Southern Italy was ravaged by a 7.2 magnitude quake that triggered a tsunami that hit the Messina-Reggio-Calabria area, killing 123,000.
The initial death toll was greatly magnified when Lenin refused to acknowledge the famine and sent no aid.
