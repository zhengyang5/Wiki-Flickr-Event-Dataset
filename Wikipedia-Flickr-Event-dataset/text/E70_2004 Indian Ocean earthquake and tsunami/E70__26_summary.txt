For the first time, orbiting satellites have observed and measured a major tsunami event in open ocean, the Indian Ocean tsunami that resulted from the magnitude 9 earthquake southwest of Sumatra on December 26.
The satellites flew over the Bay of Bengal about 150 kilometers (93 miles) apart approximately two hours after the quake.

It was followed by a trough of sea surface depression of 40 centimeters (1.3 feet) below normal.
"The detection of these tsunami waves provides yet another demonstration of the important value of satellite radar altimeter observations.
