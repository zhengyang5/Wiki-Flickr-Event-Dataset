Gretchen Cook-Anderson/ Dolores BeasleyHeadquarters, Washington(Phone: 202/358-0836/1753RELEASE : 05-0011NASA Details Earthquake Effects on the EarthNASA scientists using data from the Indonesian earthquake calculated it affected Earth's rotation, decreased the length of day, slightly changed the planet's shape, and shifted the North Pole by centimeters.
and Dr. Richard Gross of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. said all earthquakes have some affect on Earth's rotation.
This shift east is continuing a long-term seismic trend identified in previous studies.They also found the earthquake decreased the length of day by 2.68 microseconds.
It also caused an oblateness change barely detectable, and a pole shift large enough to be possibly identified.
The fault dislocation, or earthquake, consisted of a downward sliding of one plate relative to the overlying plate.
