Post-tsunami videconference forum for senior editorial staff 23 March and 20 April 2005 In the wake of the 26 December 2004 tsunami, and after discussions with news organisations in countries affected by the tsunami, the Asia Pacific Journalism Centre decided to mount an international videoconference forum for senior editorial staff.
With financial support from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and the Danish NGO International Media Support, and making use of the Global Development Learning Network of videoconference centres, the APJC coordinated two three-hour international discussions.
Participants targeted were senior editorial staff of news media organisations in countries directly affected by the tsunami.
Participants were welcomed by Mr Jack Waterford, Editor-in-Chief The Canberra Times and a member of the APJC board member.
The opening address was given by Mr Endy Bayuni, Chief Editor The Jakarta Post.
