Aid is being distributed, and no disease has been reportedJim Morris, head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said he expected food aid to reach almost all survivors within the next seven days.
The UN has warned that the toll could rise further as a result of hunger and disease.
'Optimistic'The WFP head told the BBC that aid had reached "nearly everyone who has been harmed by the disaster".
"Through our partners, a good many NGOs, we've found ways to get food to everyone who's in need," he said.
It takes almost twice as long to reach the hard-hit province of Aceh from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, as it does from Subang.
