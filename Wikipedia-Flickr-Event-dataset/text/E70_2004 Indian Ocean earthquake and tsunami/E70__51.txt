2. INFORMATION ON THE DISASTER

Occurring many times in history, a seismic sea wave, or tsunami, can bring with it much death and destruction. It is caused by an earthquake, when different plates under the sea shift, or by an eruption of an undersea volcano. These events can cause the formation of a wave that can begin as just a small ripple of a few centimeters and then grow to a height of as much as 10 meters when it approaches land. The Asian tsunami on the morning of December 26, 2004 at 7.58 a.m., was triggered by an earthquake measuring at over 9 on the Richter scale with its epicenter to the southwest of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, or 3.32 N - 95.85 E. The epicenter is approximately 580 kilometers from Phuket and around 1260 kilometers from Bangkok. Thus, the waves had an enormous distance to build before sweeping the Andaman coast. The first wave hit Phuket at 9.38 a.m., hitting 5 other Thai provinces minutes before and after. In a period of just ten minutes, the tsunami had caused extensive destruction and damage to life and property. The pattern of the attack was similar: "The sea receded as far as 500 to 1000 meters away from the coast. Twenty minutes later, the first wave of between 2-3 meters in height struck. Fifteen minutes later, the second destructive wave from between 3-10 meters in height struck. It was like a giant wall of water stretching for hundreds of kilometers pounded the coast with devastating force. It had such power that it carried big boats tied up at piers more than 50 meters inland and leveled buildings and structures in its path. Seawater reached as far as a kilometer inland. Then, the last wave, 5 meters in height, struck, ravaging the land still further and causing extreme inundation. The wave elevation grew even higher around the beaches with gentle slope and the open sea areas".
