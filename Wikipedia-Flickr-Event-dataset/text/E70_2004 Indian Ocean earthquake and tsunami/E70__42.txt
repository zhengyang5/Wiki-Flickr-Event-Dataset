On 26 December 2004 at 00:58:53 universal

time (U.T.), an earthquake of surface wave

magnitude ( M

s

) 9.0 occurred off the west coast

of northern Sumatra. Large tsu-

namis were generated that severe-

ly damaged coastal communities

in countries around the Bay of

Bengal and the Indian Ocean, in-

cluding Indonesia, Thailand, Sri

Lanka, and India. The estimated

tsu nam i death toll rang es fro m

156,000 to 178,00 0 across 11

nations, with an additional 26,500

to 142,000 missing, most of them

presumed dead.

A tsunami survey plan was

initiated within 3 days of the

earthquake; a survey team of eight

scientists from the United States

and one from New Zealand was

f o r m e da n dd i s p a t c h e dt oS r i

Lanka. The team was supported

by four Sri Lankan scientists. The

team surveyed both the east and

south west coa sts o f Sr i La nka

d u r i n g t h ep e r i o d1 0J a n u a r y

thro ugh 14 Janu ary 20 05. The

te a m measured maximum tsunami

heights, maximum runup heights,

inundation distances, and areas of

inundation. We also collected soil

samples from tsunami deposits, did

a limited aerial inspection along the

southwestern coast, and recor ded

eyewitness accounts.

The elevations of watermarks

on buildings, scars on trees, and rafted debris

were measured as indicators of the maximum

tsunami height, which is defined relative to sea

level. Inundation distance is the distance from

the shoreline to the inland limit of tsunami

flooding, and the maximum runup height is the

elevation at the inundation distance. Eve ry

mark used for the measurement was photo-

graphed, and i ts location was identified using a

global positioning satellite. Figure 1 shows the

measur ed maxi mum ts unami he ights a nd

runup heights, adjusted for the tide levels at

the time the tsunami hit.

Eyewitnesses describ ed one to three waves,

depe ndi ng on the l ocat ion, a nd pro vid ed

estimates of their heights. From Matara at the

southern tip to near Gal le, the first wave arrive d

around 03:10 U.T. (9:10 a.m. local time) as a

leading elevation wave ( 1 ) with a wave height

less than 1 m, followed 10 min later by a

second large elevation wave with wave height

up to 10 m. The leading waves were refracted

around the southern tip of the island and

reached the west coast ( 2 ). North of Galle, up

to Kaluthara, a third elevation wave with a

height up to several meters was reported near

noon, suggestive of reflection from the coast of

India or from the Maldives. On the east coast,

the first reported wave w as an elevation that

rose like a tide to Ãˆ 1m ,f o l l o w e db yad e p r e s -

sion, whereas the second elevation wave was

large and fast. On both the east and southwest

coasts, eyewitnesses reported a major recession

of hundreds of meters in horizontal length

between the first and second arrivals.

The importance of tsunami education for

coastal residents w as exemplified in a small

fishing village near Galle. One of the village

residents, a merchant marine who witnessed a

tsunami in Chile two decades ago, recognized

the sea withdrawal as a tsunami indicator. H e

gave warning to run to higher ground, which

nearly all his fellow residents followed. In this

village of a few hundred, only one died.

We noted a number of instances where

human development likely modified the runup

behavior of the tsunami. The Sumudra Devi, a

passenger train out of Colombo, was derailed

and overtu rned by the tsuna mi,

killing more than 1,000. In the i m-

mediate area, substantial coral

mining ha d occurre d, related to

tourism development. Tsunami

runup in the area was nearly 8 m.

In the town of Yala, tourism activi-

ties also affected the tsunami runup.

One resort, for the purpose of better

scenic views, had removed some of

the dune seaward o f its hotel. The

hotel was destroyed by t he tsunami.

Substantially lar ger water eleva-

tions and greater damage observa-

tions were found near the hotel, as

compare d to ne ighboring area s

located behind unalter ed dunes. In

essence, by removing some of the

natural coastal protection in a local-

ized area , a conduit wa s created

through which the t sunami energy

could flow more freely.
