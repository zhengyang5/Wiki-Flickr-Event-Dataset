International tsunami survey teams with experts from many countries surveyed the coasts of almost all of the Indian Ocean countries that were affected by the tsunami.
The measured runup heights (tsunami wave heights) from these field surveys, eyewitness accounts, and tide gauges are displayed in the image.
A runup is the difference between the elevation of maximum tsunami penetration (inundation line) and the sea level at the time of the tsunami.
There were 40 tide gauge recordings in the Indian Ocean with a maximum amplitude of 1.75 m at Port Blair, Andaman Islands.
The total estimated material losses in the Indian Ocean region were $10 billion and insured losses were $2 billion.
