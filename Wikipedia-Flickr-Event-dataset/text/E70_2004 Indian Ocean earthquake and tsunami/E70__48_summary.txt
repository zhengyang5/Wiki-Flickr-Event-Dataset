Unusual tidal surges and strong currents hitting the coastline of Western Australia, caused by the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami, are set to continue for at least 24 hours, forecasters have warned.
Perth Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Grant Elliott said the bizarre consequences of the world's worst earthquake in 40 years were hard to predict.
"But because this is beyond our experience we don't know what ripples might remain in the basin, so we just don't know who, what, where or why really."
Tidal surges were reported from Geraldton, 425 km north of Perth - where several boats in the port lost their moorings - to Busselton, 232 km south of Perth.
Two people had to be rescued after strong tidal surges swept them out to sea in Busselton, where surges of one metre every 30 to 60 minutes were reported.
