Tsunami Recordings on Tide Gages

The Indian Ocean tsunami was recorded on several tide gages recorded at the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center. The gages are operated by many different agencies including the NOAA/National Ocean Service, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center , the University of Hawaii , and the National Tidal Facility of Australia. Click on the site name to see a graph of the tsunami. Wave heights are maximum peak-to-trough height in cm. Arrival times are the actual tsunami arrival time in UTC on gages where it can be determined. The sample interval column lists the time between samples. Click on the sample interval to get the raw data. Water levels are given in meters and time in a decimal day format. One minute data is given where available with the time in hour minute format. NOTE: The data is provided as recorded at the WC/ATWC � some gaps and repetitions occur within the data files.
