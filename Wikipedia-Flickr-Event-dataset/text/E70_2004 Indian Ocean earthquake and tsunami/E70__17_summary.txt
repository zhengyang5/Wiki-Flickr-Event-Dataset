One of the volcanoes is rattling the island hardest hit by the December quake and the tsunami it created.
But not all the volcanoes around Sumatra, just Talang - maybe because Talang, the pressure under the volcano is high enough," he said.
"So this is very simply triggered by energy released by the tectonic earthquake can trigger an eruption like that."
In addition, last month an 8.7 magnitude quake devastated the island Nias, just off the Sumatran coast.
