Waves from the Dec. 2004 tsunami traveled as far as Nova Scotia and Peru.
The Southeast Indian Ridge, Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, and the East Pacific Rise served as wave guides for waves entering the Pacific Ocean.
However, many of the gauges in the Indian Ocean either malfunctioned or were destroyed, so some of the largest waves may have been missed.
For example, waves traveling southwestward along the Southwest Indian Ocean ridge hit a sharp right turn when they reached the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which veers north.
Mid-ocean ridges did not, however, affect the course of the waves that did most of the damage in the Indian Ocean basin.
