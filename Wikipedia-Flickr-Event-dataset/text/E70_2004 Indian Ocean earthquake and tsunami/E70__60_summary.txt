Tsunami in 2004 'not the first'By Jason PalmerScience and Technology reporter, BBC NewsBefore and after photos show the sediment coverage after the 2004 tsunamiThe Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 was not the first of its size to hit the region, according to new research.
The surge of a tsunami brings with it a great deal of sediment that rushes inland; the bigger the tsunami, the deeper and further inland the layer of sediment it leaves behind.
How tsunami happen The study of these layers in coastal regions has revealed instances of tsunami elsewhere in the world, including a prehistoric event that inundated the Shetland and Orkney islands off Scotland.
In both locations, a deep sandy layer was found beneath the surface, matching the top layer of sand left from the 2004 tsunami.
Those buried layers occurred as far inland as those on the surface, suggesting that the tsunami that deposited them centuries ago was of roughly the same size as the 2004 event.
