Researchers in Thailand and Indonesia wrote in two articles in Nature magazine, that the tsunami hit around 1400, long before historical records of earthquakes in the region began.
The Indonesian site is around two kilometres inland north of the town of Meulaboh in Aceh.
The Thai location is at Phra Thong Island, 124 kilometres north of the resort of Phuket.
Both places were hit by the 2004 tsunami.
