Indonesia was hardest-hit by the December 26 quake and tsunamis, with a total 230,261 people listed as dead or missing, the health ministry said.
The toll in Sri Lanka, which was second hardest hit by the catastrophe, stood at 30,957, according to the Centre for National Operations.
The number of people listed as missing was 5,637, but many were expected to be among those never formally identified, hurriedly buried and included in the confirmed death toll.
In neighbouring India, the official death toll has reached 10,744 with 5,669 still reported missing and feared dead.
In addition, 3,109 people are listed as missing in Thailand and 5,637 in Sri Lanka but not included in the toll because of likely double counting.
