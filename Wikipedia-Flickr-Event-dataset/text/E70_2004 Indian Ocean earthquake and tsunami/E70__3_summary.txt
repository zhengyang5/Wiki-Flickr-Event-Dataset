Astonishing Wave Heights Among the Findings of an International Tsunami Survey Team on Sumatrain this issue: next storyAn International Tsunami Survey Team (ITST) studying the effects of the December 26 tsunami on Indonesia's island of Sumatra documented wave heights of 20 to 30 m (65 to 100 ft ) at the island's northwest end and found evidence suggesting that wave heights may have ranged from 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft ) along a 100- km (60- mi ) stretch of the northwest coast.
These wave heights are higher than those predicted by computer models made soon after the earthquake that triggered the tsunami.
Many buildings in Banda Aceh withstood the earthquake shaking but were destroyed by the tsunami waves.
Likely because of the area's low elevation, the first tsunami wave that struck Banda Aceh did not have time to recede before the arrival of the next wave: the second tsunami wave rode over the first, and the third rode over the second.
Items broken and bent by the tsunami waves, as well as sedimentary structures in the tsunami deposits, were used to determine flow directions.
