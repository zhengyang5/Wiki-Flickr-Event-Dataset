"We were lucky: our coasts are not populated, otherwise it would have been much worse," Abdulkhaliq al-Ghaberi, director-general of the EEU, told IRIN in the capital, Sana.
The tsunami hit parts of South East Asia on 26 December 2004, killing an estimated 300,000 people.
However, there have been reports of up to five people killed, and al-Ghaberi told IRIN that there might have been more deaths which remain unreported.
The emergency EEU/UNEP assessment was conducted only on Socotra and in al-Mahrah, the worst affected areas.
Afif told IRIN that the total was likely to reach $9,140,000.
