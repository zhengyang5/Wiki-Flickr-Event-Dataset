ABC NewsVolcano on Indonesia's Sumatra EruptsVolcano on Indonesia's Sumatra Island Erupts, Spews Out AshThe Associated PressJAKARTA, Indonesia Apr 11, 2005 Â— A volcano on Indonesia's Sumatra Island erupted Tuesday, spewing out clouds of ash and causing villages on its slopes to flee their homes in panic, government volcanologists said.
Despite the eruption, the volcano posed no immediate threat to people living nearby, and the government had not officially urged them to evacuate their homes, said Taufan Hardiamaitalas, a second volcanologist.
Talang began rumbling shortly before dawn Tuesday, and then spewed out ash up to 1,640 feet into the air.
Around 1,000 people living on the mountain's slopes left their homes and moved to villages further away from the 9,000-foot volcano, said Hardiamaitalas.
The country is part of the Pacific "Ring of Fire" a series of volcanoes and fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and Southeast Asia.
