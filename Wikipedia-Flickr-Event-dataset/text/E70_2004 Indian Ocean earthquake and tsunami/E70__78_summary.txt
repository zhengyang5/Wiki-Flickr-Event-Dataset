Other relics were revealed when the powerful waves washed away sand as they smashed into the Tamil Nadu coast.
'Clear pattern'The Archaeological Survey of India launched the diving expedition after residents reported seeing a temple and other structures as the sea pulled back just before the tsunami hit.
Experts say a lion revealed by the tsunami is from the 7th CenturyThe new finds were made close to the 7th Century beachfront Mahabalipuram temple, which some say is the structure that survived the wrath of the gods.
"We've found some stone structures which are clearly man-made," expedition leader Alok Tripathi told the AFP news agency.
The ancient "gifts" of the tsunami are expected to be presented to an international seminar on maritime archaeology in Delhi next month.
