The death toll from last month's earthquake and tsunamis that devastated Indian Ocean coastlines topped 159,000 as Indonesia added another 1,261 to its list of fatalities.

Indonesia, hardest-hit by the December 26 walls of water, has now reported 106,523 deaths, with 12,047 people missing, an increase of more than 2,000 from Tuesday, the social affairs ministry said.

Aid workers on the ground say many more bodies are yet to be collected.

In Sri Lanka, the toll stands at 30,882 confirmed dead, the government said. The number of people reported missing jumped from 5,903 to 6,088, latest government figures showed.

In neighbouring India, the official toll stood 10,327 with 5,628 still missing and feared dead.

The death toll in Thailand Wednesday rose by four to 5,313, but the number of missing continued to slip, down 25 to 3,345, including 1,078 foreigners and 2,267 Thais.

Myanmar's Prime Minister Soe Win said Thursday 59 people were killed in the tsunamis and more than 3,200 left homeless. This was down from the UN's estimated 90.

At least 82 people were killed and another 26 were missing in the Maldives, a government spokesman said.

Sixty-eight people were dead in Malaysia, most of them in Penang, according to police, while in Bangladesh a father and child were killed after a tourist boat capsized in large waves, officials said.

Fatalities also occurred on the east coast of Africa where 298 people were declared dead in Somalia, 10 in Tanzania and one in Kenya.

The US Geological Survey said the earthquake west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra measured 9.0 on the Richter scale -- making it the largest quake worldwide in four decades.
