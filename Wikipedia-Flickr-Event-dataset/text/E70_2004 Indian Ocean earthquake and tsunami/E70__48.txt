Unusual tidal surges and strong currents hitting the coastline of Western Australia, caused by the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami, are set to continue for at least 24 hours, forecasters have warned.



Meteorologists said they did not know exactly how long the local effects of the undersea earthquake would last, but they were expecting the surges to last at least throughout today.



Perth Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Grant Elliott said the bizarre consequences of the world's worst earthquake in 40 years were hard to predict.



"We do expect the effects to continue, and we have had anecdotal evidence of tides up to a metre higher than normal," Mr Elliott said.



"But because this is beyond our experience we don't know what ripples might remain in the basin, so we just don't know who, what, where or why really."



The first waves arrived on the west coast on Sunday afternoon and continued into yesterday.



Tidal surges were reported from Geraldton, 425 km north of Perth - where several boats in the port lost their moorings - to Busselton, 232 km south of Perth.



The southern half of the state felt the greatest effects, despite being further away from the epicentre of the quake, because it was more directly in line with it.



Two people had to be rescued after strong tidal surges swept them out to sea in Busselton, where surges of one metre every 30 to 60 minutes were reported.
