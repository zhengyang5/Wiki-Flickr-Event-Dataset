A World Food Programme official said researchers found 200 households where at least one member was out fishing when it hit and is still missing.
Burma's government has released initial figures of 53 dead and 21 missing.
Burma rarely gives figures of dead from natural disasters, but aid agencies did say the country nevertheless appears to have escaped the tsunami's worst.
However, Heather Hill, a WFP official in Bangkok, said that UN and WFP staff in Burma have found evidence to suggest that some 200 fishermen are missing in the coastal region of Kawthaung.
Independent observers are unlikely to gain access to these remote areas, which means that an accurate picture of the impact of the tsunami on Burma may never be known.
