Although similar seismographs have existed since the 1890's, it was only in the 1930's that Charles F. Richter, a California seismologist, introduced the concept of earthquake magnitude.
The two largest reported moments are 2.5 X 1030 dyn·cm (dyne·centimeters) for the 1960 Chile earthquake ( M S 8.5; M W 9.6) and 7.5 X 1029 dyn·cm for the 1964 Alaska earthquake ( M S 8.3; M W 9.2).
When an earthquake occurs, much of the available local stress is used to power the earthquake fracture growth to produce heat rather that to generate seismic waves.
Of an earthquake system's total energy, perhaps 10 percent to less that 1 percent is ultimately radiated as seismic energy.
For scientific purposes, this earthquake depth range of 0 - 700 km is divided into three zones: shallow, intermediate, and deep.
