Additionally, NOAA, under its National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) has embarked upon an aggressive inter-governmental, multi-pronged effort to (1) improve the USâ€™s tsunami warning capabilities (2) improve tsunami hazard assessment (produce local tsunami inundation maps) and (3) develop localized tsunami hazard mitigation programs including public awareness and community awareness (TsunamiReady Communities).
They are responsible for issuing local tsunami advisories, alerts and warnings for local tsunamis triggered by a local seismic event.
The PTWC also serves as the Tsunami Warning Center for the Pacific.
If PTWC determines that a destructive tsunami has been generated, tsunami warnings are issued.
Note: The Indian Ocean tsunami is now reported to be one of the strongest in the world over the past 40 years.
