Post-tsunami videconference forum for senior editorial staff 23 March and 20 April 2005 In the wake of the 26 December 2004 tsunami, and after discussions with news organisations in countries affected by the tsunami, the Asia Pacific Journalism Centre decided to mount an international videoconference forum for senior editorial staff. The goal was to discuss important issues thrown up by the tsunami. These included sharing information on death and injury to staff and families, the destruction of news media infrastructure, and the effect on journalists of reporting trauma. They also included the on-going challenge of how to report the reconstruction process. With financial support from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and the Danish NGO International Media Support, and making use of the Global Development Learning Network of videoconference centres, the APJC coordinated two three-hour international discussions. Participants targeted were senior editorial staff of news media organisations in countries directly affected by the tsunami. These included reporters with influence on the planning of news coverage, news editors and other editorial executives. Funding was provided for travel to videoconference centres by journalists in Aceh in Indonesia and those from the north, east and south coasts of Sri Lanka. The first videoconference took place on 23 March 4-7pm Canberra time and involved 40 participants attending videoconference sites in Jakarta, Colombo, Chennai, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Canberra. The theme of the discussion was Review and recovery: situation on the ground and current condition of news media in tsunami-affected nations. Participants were welcomed by Mr Jack Waterford, Editor-in-Chief The Canberra Times and a member of the APJC board member. The opening address was given by Mr Endy Bayuni, Chief Editor The Jakarta Post.
