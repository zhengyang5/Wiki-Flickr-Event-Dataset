A missioner in Ranong, a town on the border between Thailand and Myanmar, says locals talk about 600 victims.
“I spoke to some Burmese and they told many people died on the Burmese islands”, Father Michael said.
The number of 600 dead, Father Michael said, came from a local Thai newspaper.
What is sure is that Myanmar has many islands which were right on the tsunami’s pathway”.
According to Father Michael, there is “a good arrangement between the government, Buddhists and Christians” in distributing aid.
