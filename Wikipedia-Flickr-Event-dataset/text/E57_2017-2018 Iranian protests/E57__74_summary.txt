Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declared Sunday that the country’s unrest of recent days has been quelled.
But even as the force made the declaration, there remained signs of protest on social media.
Dozens of videos of the burning of government documents have shown up online in recent days, although they couldn’t be independently verified.
The video footage showed what purported to be identification cards, or in some cases a utility bill from a state-owned company, being set aflame.
