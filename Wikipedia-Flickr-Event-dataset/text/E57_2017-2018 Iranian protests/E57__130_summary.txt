There was big news last night about the North and South arranging talks for next week, North Korea now coming to the table.
QUESTION: But it could be a positive sign maybe that North Korea wants to engage a little bit.
So how we begin the talks is yet to be determined, but we clearly need a signal from North Korea that they understand these talks must lead to that conclusion.
So there are very positive outcomes to these talks for North Korea, as there will be positive outcomes for the security of the entire region.
I think thatâ€™s well recognized.
