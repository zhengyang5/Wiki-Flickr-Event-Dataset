Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini accused the country's enemies of meddling in recent protests, in his first public comments since anti-government demonstrations erupted six days ago.
According to comments published Tuesday on Khamenei's official website, the supreme leader said Iran's enemies had used money, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatuses "to create problems for the Islamic system."
Still, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency warned Tuesday that arrested protesters could potentially face the death penalty when they come to trial.
