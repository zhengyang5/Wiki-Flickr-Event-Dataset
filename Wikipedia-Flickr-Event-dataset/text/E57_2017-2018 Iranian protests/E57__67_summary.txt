TEHRAN, Iran (AP) â€” Breaking his silence over nationwide protests that included calls for his ouster, Iran's supreme leader on Tuesday blamed the demonstrations on "enemies of Iran," saying they were meddling in its internal affairs.
Undoubtedly high on his list is the U.S., where President Donald Trump has tweeted his support for the protests for several days.
On Tuesday, he wrote that "the people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime."
Gulf Arab nations have been watching the protests carefully, with Saudi-funded satellite channels in particular playing up the unrest.
