DUBAI (Reuters) - Street protests hit Iran for a third day running on Saturday, spreading to the capital Tehran with crowds confronting police and attacking some state buildings, and a social media report said two demonstrators had been shot dead in a provincial town.
Social media video from Mashhad showed protesters overturning a riot police car and police motorcycles set ablaze.
In Tehran and Karaj west of the capital, protesters smashed windows on state buildings and set fires in the streets.
Iranian media and social media also reported protests in the cities of Kashan, Arak, Ahvaz, Zanjan, Bandar Abbas and Kerman.
Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli warned against attempts to promote protests via social media.
