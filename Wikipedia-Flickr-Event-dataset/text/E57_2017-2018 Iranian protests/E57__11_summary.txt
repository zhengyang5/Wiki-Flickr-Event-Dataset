Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was reportedly arrested for “inciting violence” as the protests against the Tehran government and skyrocketing food prices began.
Ahmadinejad was busted for comments he made during a Dec. 28 protest in the western Iranian city of Bushehr, the London-based Al-Quds Al-Arabi newspaper reported.
The protests were the largest in Iran since 2009, when massive crowds challenged the re-election of Ahmadinejad, believing it had been rigged.
Khamenei ​used the Revolutionary Guard and other security forces to brutally quash that uprising.
During his presidency, Ahmadinejad referred to the Holocaust as a “myth” and told Americans, “In Iran, we don’t have homosexuals like in your country.”With Wire Services
