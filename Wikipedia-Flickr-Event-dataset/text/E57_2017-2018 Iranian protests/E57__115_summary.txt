TEHRAN, Jan. 14 (MNA) – Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi Tehran Prosecutor General said on Sunday that another 300 of the detainees who were arrested in the course of recent riots were freed from prisons.
“Social discontent, economic problems, and social failures acted as the base for staging the recent protesting riots, however they cannot justify the reason for the recent events and we have to trace the role of Internet calls for uprising in the formation of recent riots,” said Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi Tehran Prosecutor General on Sunday.
“The role of US, MKO members, terror cells, and anti-revolutionary elements should be borne in mind in delineating the reasons for the formation of recent riots,” he added.
“Prior to events in Mashhad, some anti-revolutionary elements had staged activities in Tehran that police vigilantly contained them,” noted Mr. Jafari Dowlatabadi.
According to Mr. Jafari Dowlatabadi so far 440 detainees have been freed.
