As many as 21 people have been officially reported killed including one policeman as demonstrations in Iran continued throughout Sunday.
The death of the officer is the first fatality among security forces struggling to contain five days of unrest which is challenging the county's clerical leadership.
President Hassan Rouhani has played down the protests which began last Thursday, initially against price rises and corruption but which have taken on a wider anti-government sentiment.
He said Iranians had the right to criticise but not to cause unrest and vowed to crackdown on lawbreakers.
While anti-government protests have broken out across the country, there have also been demonstrations of support for the government.
