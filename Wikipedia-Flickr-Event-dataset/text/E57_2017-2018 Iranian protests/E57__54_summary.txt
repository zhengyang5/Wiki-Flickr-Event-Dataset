INCREDIBLY, religious hardliners may have started the protests that have spread across Iran.
Even as the hardliners retreated, the protests spread to more than 20 cities, where Iranians of all stripes voiced pent-up anger over a lack of economic and political progress.
The protests have also spread to Tehran, the capital, where hundreds of people have been arrested.
The latest rallies have attracted only thousands, mostly in towns and small cities.
But Mr Rouhaniâ€™s promise to listen has so far failed to stem the protests, and the authorities are increasingly resorting to force.
