(Reuters) - One of the chief beneficiaries of this week’s easing of Iranian sanctions is the country’s ruler - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Washington targeted Iran’s petrochemical industry last year, with an Obama administration official saying the sector had become a significant source of Iran’s foreign earnings.
Dozens of petrochemical products are no longer under sanctions, including ammonia, methanol and chlorine.
Last June, the Treasury Department said Setad also controls Marjan Petrochemical, which is investing in methanol production, and Sadaf Petrochemical Assaluyeh, which makes rubber.
