An Iranian protester killed one police officer and wounded three others, the Iranian government said Monday, in the first reported death among the security forces since a wave of protests broke out last week.
Police said a man in the central city of Najafabad opened fire on officers with a hunting rifle as people took to the streets during what has become the largest protests in Iran since 2009.
The killing did not appear to be part of a coordinated attack and it was not immediately clear what happened to the gunman.
"A rioter took advantage of the situation in the city of Najaf Abad and fired shots at police forces with a hunting rifle.
As a result, three were wounded, and one was martyred,‚Äù Saeed Montazer al-Mahdi, the police spokesman, told Iranian state television.
