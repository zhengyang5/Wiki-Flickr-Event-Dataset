TEHRAN: Fresh protests broke out as night fell in Iran on Monday with reports of a policeman shot dead, as the authorities moved to crack down on days of unrest across the country.
State television said one policeman had been killed and three others wounded by fire from hunting rifles in the city of Najafabad in central Iran.
IRINN/ReutersTVTehran has seen relatively small protests, but many people sympathise with the economic grievances driving the unrest.
Authorities ruthlessly put down the 2009 protests, which followed a disputed presidential election that gave hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term.
At least 36 people were killed in the 2009 unrest, according to an official toll, while the opposition says 72 died.
