(CNN) Roughly 3,700 people were arrested during recent anti-government protests in Iran, one of the country's lawmakers claimed on Tuesday.
The number is far higher than the 450 people Iranian authorities previously said were detained.
Tehran member of parliament Mahmoud Sadeghi said Tuesday that 3,700 people had been arrested, including 40 to 68 students, in six days of protests that broke out in late December.
Students protest at the University of Tehran on December 30.
He made the remarks during a speech commemorating protests against the Shah of Iran in 1978.
