As violent protests in Iran continue into their fourth day, the Iranian authorities have restricted access to social media tools being used to organize them, and in some regions have reportedly shut down internet access altogether.
The Iranian restrictions appear to have gone beyond social media.
Saudi-backed news service Al Arabiya this morning reported that Iranian telecom providers have actually blocked internet access in several cities.
The Iranian protests are driven in part by economic discontent.
They are the largest protests in the country since 2009’s “Green Revolution,” in which social media including Twitter played a major – though perhaps exaggerated – role.
