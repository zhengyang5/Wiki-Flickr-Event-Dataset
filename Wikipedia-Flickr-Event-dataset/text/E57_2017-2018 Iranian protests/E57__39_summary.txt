SUPREME LEADER: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, shown at a 2009 clerical gathering, oversees an organization called Setad that has assets estimated at about $95 billion.
It was taken by an organization that is controlled by the most powerful man in Iran: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
But Setad's holdings of real estate, corporate stakes and other assets total about $95 billion, Reuters has calculated.
How Setad came into those assets also mirrors how the deposed monarchy obtained much of its fortune - by confiscating real estate.
All told, Reuters was able to identify about $95 billion in property and corporate assets controlled by Setad.
