Throughout the day on Thursday, reports emerged from various cities in Iran regarding mass protests against high rates of inflations, rising food prices, and a general trend of economic mismanagement.
Many of the thousands of demonstrators blamed government corruption for a significant portion of the hardships they were facing.
Little has been done to follow through on those promises, either with regard to economic indicators or the suppression of free speech throughout the country.
Earlier in December, Rouhani presented the draft budget for the Iranian calendar year spanning from March 2018 to March 2019.
Indeed, analyses of the budget identify those entities as major priorities for the Iranian government, including its supposedly moderate president.
