Iranian authorities restored access to Instagram on Saturday and staged more pro-government rallies in response to nationwide protests that roiled the country last week.
The photo-sharing service and the messaging app Telegram were blocked after the protests against high prices escalated into calls for leadership change.
Iran's state TV on Saturday showed pro-government rallies in several cities, starting with Amol, in the northern province of Mazandaram, where hundreds of people waved the Iranian flag and chanted slogans against the United States and Israel.
At least 21 people were killed and hundreds arrested over the protests, which saw chants against the government of president Hassan Rouhani and the Khomeini's sucessor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Member of parliament Mahmoud Sadeghi said the whereabouts of around 10 of the 90 university students arrested during the protests were not known.
