Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani spoke out against his country’s hard-liners on Monday, saying the young protesters who took to the streets over the past 10 days want more than the country’s conservative elites can offer.
As people chant slogans against Iran’s religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, politicians like Rouhani are working to ensure they are not blamed for the unrest.
Some said the protesters' economic grievances were highlighted when Rouhani leaked a proposed government budget last month.
“President Rouhani is fully aware that parts of the recent unrest were instigated by his political opponents.
So he will now hit back by putting the blame [for the protesters' grievances] on state entities beyond his own reach,” Adnan Tabatabai, an Iran analyst, told Newsweek.
