Washington (CNN) US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley warned Iran on Friday that no government can legitimately deny human rights, adding that the regime is "now on notice."
Haley's comments come at a United Nations Security Council meeting that centered on Iran after the US requested an emergency session amid protests in the country.
"Human rights are not the gift of governments, they are the inalienable rights of the people themselves," Haley said.
Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia also slammed the US for using the meeting to bring up the Iranian protests under a "bogus pretext."
Haley said earlier this week that the US wanted emergency meetings in New York and in Geneva at the Human Rights Council to discuss the Iran situation.
