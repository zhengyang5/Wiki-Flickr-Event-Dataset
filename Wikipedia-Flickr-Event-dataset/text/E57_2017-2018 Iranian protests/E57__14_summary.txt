There have been conflicting reports about the circumstances surrounding Mr Ghanbari’s death, with activists disputing the authorities’ claims he committed suicide.
At least four further deaths in custody have been reported, including another two deaths in the same “quarantine” section, according to prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh.
“Instead of rushing to the judgment that they committed suicide, the authorities must immediately launch an independent, impartial, and transparent investigation, including independent autopsies.
This is where detainees are often held shortly after arrest and checked to see if they’re carrying drugs or infections before transfer.
Some have been transferred to sections of the prison that are run by the Revolutionary Guard or Ministry of Intelligence.
