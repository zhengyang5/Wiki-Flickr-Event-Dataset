Some 4,000 people are taking part in a pro-government rally in Tehran amid a series of economic protests in Iran.
One pro-government demonstrator, 27-year-old Ali Ahmadi, blamed the U.S for all of Iran's economic problems.
The economic protests began Wednesday.
The government-sponsored demonstration planned for Saturday come as U.S. President Donald Trump has tweeted out support for those now protesting in major Iranian cities.
The economic protests began Thursday after being sparked in part by social media and have drawn thousands into the streets in several cities in Iran.
