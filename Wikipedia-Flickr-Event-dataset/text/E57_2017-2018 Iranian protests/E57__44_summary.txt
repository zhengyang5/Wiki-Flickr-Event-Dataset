ECONOMIC WOESThe collapse last year of the Caspian Credit Institute, which promised depositors returns often seen in Ponzi schemes, showed the economic desperation faced by many in Iran.
Both the U.S. and analysts studying Iran say hard-liners initially fomented the economic protests to put pressure on Rouhani but quickly lost control of them.
It's hard to tell right now who emerged stronger after the protests â€” Rouhani or his hard-line opponents.
The protests quickly raised the hopes of those abroad who want to see an end to the Islamic Republic.
Instead, Iran's ruling system faces a future of grappling with the effects of economic woes that have proven to be unpredictable and potentially volatile.
