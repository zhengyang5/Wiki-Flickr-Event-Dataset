Such scenes might have been unfathomable a decade ago -- but these new protests, challenging the rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, represent discontent rarely seen in Iran.
The protests, which began Thursday night , are a reaction to Iran's sputtering economy, rampant corruption and rising fuel and food prices.
In his first remarks since the protests began, Khamenei on Tuesday accused Iran's enemies of "joining forces" and blamed them for inciting the protests.
"This is not about Trump, and Trump stepping into this is not necessarily helpful, because he doesn't carry any credibility in Iran."
"That had a chilling impact on the protests in Iran, and it had a chilling impact around the world," Robertson said.
