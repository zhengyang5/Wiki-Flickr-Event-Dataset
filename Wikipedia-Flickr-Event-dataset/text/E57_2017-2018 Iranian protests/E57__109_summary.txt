Iran on Saturday lifted restrictions on the messaging app Telegram, the state news agency IRNA said.
(Associated Press)As the protests ebbed, the government last week lifted restrictions imposed on Instagram, one social media tool used to mobilize protesters.
But access to the more widely used messaging app Telegram was still blocked, suggesting authorities remained uneasy about the possibility of further protests.
But it declined to block other channels, prompting Iranian authorities to block access to the app.
Iran continues to impose restrictions on the internet and social media, with Facebook and Twitter still blocked.
