(CNN) The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards said Wednesday that a string of anti-government protests were over after six days of unrest.
The protests began last Thursday over Iran's stagnant economy and the rising cost of living but quickly have developed into a broader outcry against the government.
Many held pictures of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and waved national flags.
You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!"
Iran's missile program is not in breach of its nuclear deal and will continue despite objections from the United States, Rouhani has said.
