Just before arriving in Paris, Erdogan accused the United States and Israel of meddling in Iran in the wake of protests in the country against the regime.
“We cannot accept that some countries — foremost the US, Israel — to interfere in the internal affairs of Iran and Pakistan,” the Turkish president told reporters.
