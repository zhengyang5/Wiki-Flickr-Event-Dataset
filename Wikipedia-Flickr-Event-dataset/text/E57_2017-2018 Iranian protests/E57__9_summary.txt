In many locations in Tehran protests took place against the Islamic Republic and the dire economic conditions in the country.
Video clips have circulated showing protests in Tehran’s Towhid square where people were shouting, “Death to Khamenei” and “Referendum, Referendum”.
General Mohammad Kosari added that Basij forces have come to the assistance of police forces and individuals who are responsible for the unrest “must answer to the people”.
However, as night fell, there were reports of more unrest in more locations in the country, including Arak, Bandar Abbas, Kermanshah Dezful and Khorramabad.
Radio Farda is treating all news and images of arson and similar acts with caution, as it is difficult to tell the difference between real events and provocations.
