In his first speech since anti-establishment protests flared across the country, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that people were free to protest, the Associated Press reported.
The move came as anti-government protests continued to spread across the country and after protesters used social media to share and upload videos of the demonstrations.
The protests represent the largest unrest in the country since 2009, when huge rallies protested the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Associated Press reported.
The protesters are also rallying against the repressive regime and its interventionist foreign policy involving wars in Iraq and Syria.
Amid calls for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down, demonstrators shouted “Long Live Reza Shah,” Reuters reported.
