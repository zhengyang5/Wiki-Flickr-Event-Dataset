The protests began against rising prices but have spiralled into a general outcry against clerical rule and government policies.
The demonstrations began in the north-eastern city of Mashhad - the country's second most-populous - on Thursday.
The protests spread to other cities in the north-east, and and some developed into broader anti-government demonstrations, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to police beatings.
On Friday, despite warnings from authorities, the demonstrations spread further to some of the biggest cities in the country.
But the protests clearly stem from seething discontent in Iran, mainly because of the worsening economic conditions faced by ordinary Iranians.
