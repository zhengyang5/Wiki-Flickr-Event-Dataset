Iranian President Hassan Rouhani phoned his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday to demand action against a “terrorist” Iranian opposition group he accused of fomenting ongoing protests.
“We criticize the fact that a terrorist group has a base in France and acts against the Iranian people… and we await action from the French government against this terrorist group,” Rouhani told Macron, according to a report on Iranian state television.
He was referring to an exiled Iranian opposition group based in Paris and called the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq.
Earlier on Tuesday, France expressed concern over the “number of victims and arrests” in the protests roiling Iran.
The ministry declined to confirm whether French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was still planning to visit Iran on Friday.
