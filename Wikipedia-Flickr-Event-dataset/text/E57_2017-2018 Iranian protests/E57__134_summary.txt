Dismissing the notion of any Israeli connection to the ongoing protests in Iran, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the “heroic” demonstrators protesting against the “cruel regime” in a YouTube video published Monday.
“I heard today Iran’s President [Hassan] Rouhani’s claim that Israel is behind the protests in Iran.
Rouhani had said earlier Monday that the protests were being pushed by Saudi Arabia, which was trying to destabilize the country along with the US and Israel.
“Sadly, many European governments watch in silence as heroic young Iranians are beaten in the streets.
Social media reports said relatively small groups were chanting anti-regime slogans in downtown parts of the capital.
