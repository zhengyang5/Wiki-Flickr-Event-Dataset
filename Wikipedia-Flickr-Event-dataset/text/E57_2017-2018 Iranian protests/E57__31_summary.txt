According to state media, at least 21 people have died in the recent Iran protests, which were sparked by concerns about rising living costs and a stagnant economy but have developed into a broader outcry against the regime.
On Facebook earlier this week, Kamran shared an image of guards' cars turned over and set on fire taken during recent protests.
Some feel optimistic the recent protests will ignite positive change.
Pooya Dayanim, president of the Iranian Jewish Public Affairs Committee, also agrees these protests -- while reminiscent of the revolution -- have a different tone.
Hoping all protesters, Iranians, and my fellow Mashhadies stay safe ❤️#IranianProtests — Yara shahidi (@YaraShahidi) December 30, 2017
