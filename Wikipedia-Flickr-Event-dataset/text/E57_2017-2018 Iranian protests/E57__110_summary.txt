Iran has restricted access to the Instagram and Telegram social media apps as a security measure during rare anti-government protests, according to state TV.
"With a decision by the Supreme National Security Council, activities of Telegram and Instagram are temporarily limited," the Irib News report said, without elaborating.
Saturday marked the third day of anti-government protests across Iran, when students and police clashed in Tehran.
Mahan Abedin, an Iran analyst at Middle East Eye, said the protests reflect the gap between ordinary Iranians and the political elite.
Reports said activists on social media have called for a fourth day of protests on Sunday.
