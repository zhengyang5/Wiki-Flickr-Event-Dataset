The US successfully fought off a Russian-led attempt on Friday to block a UN security council discussion over the past week’s Iranian protests.
But it immediately found itself at odds with its European partners, who used the subsequent debate to reject American efforts to make the protests an excuse for ditching the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
Russia had tried to stop the UN discussion on the grounds that it would represent an inappropriate interference in Iran’s internal affairs.
But the US countered by finding the required votes on the 15-strong security council to press for a debate.
The UK’s representative Matthew Rycoft said Britain remained fully committed to the JCPOA [the nuclear deal], describing it as one of the great diplomatic successes of recent memory.
