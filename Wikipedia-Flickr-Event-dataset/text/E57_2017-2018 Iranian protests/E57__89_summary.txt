The White House is calling reports of Iranian protesters tortured or killed in prison "disturbing" and demands freedom for all political prisoners reportedly held in Iran.
"We will not remain silent as the Iranian dictatorship represses the basic rights of its citizens and will hold Iran's leaders accountable for any violations," a White House statement said Wednesday.
It says the Iranian people are expressing legitimate grievances over government oppression, corruption, waste and military adventurism.
Protests against bad economic conditions, regional military interference and perceived government corruption erupted across Iran on December 28.
While the Iranian government said the protesters have the right to be heard, it says it will not tolerate violence.
