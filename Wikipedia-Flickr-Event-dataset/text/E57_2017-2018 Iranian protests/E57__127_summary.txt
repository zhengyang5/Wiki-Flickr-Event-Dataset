Hundreds of people involved in protests roiling Iran since last week have been detained as authorities clamp down on unrest.
Since Saturday, 350 people have been held in the capital Tehran, Aliasghar Naserbakht, the province’s deputy for political and security affairs, told the Iranian Labor News Agency.
U.S. President Donald Trump, a vocal critic of Iran who has threatened to abandon the 2015 nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic, again tweeted his support to the Iranian people.
“The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime,” he said.
In his first remarks since the protests broke out, Khamenei accused Iran’s enemies of stoking unrest, without naming anyone.
