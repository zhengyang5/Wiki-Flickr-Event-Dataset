Thousands of pro-government counter-protesters have taken to the streets of Iranian cities after nearly a week of unrest.
The protester claimed the security guards also damaged public properties to find a pretext to step up their crackdown.
No independent journalists are permitted to film the anti-government protests, while Iranian authorities have on similar occasions bussed in supporters.
Trump on Wednesday pledged support for Iranians trying to “take back” their government.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, on Tuesday and called for restraint, his office said.
