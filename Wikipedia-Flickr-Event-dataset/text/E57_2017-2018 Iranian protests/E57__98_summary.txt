REUTERS/Raheb Homavandi (IRAN)Iran has banned teaching English in primary school classrooms as the country tries to quell Western influence.
The Iranian government has blamed the West for provoking recent mass protests against the country's regime, which have at least left 21 dead.
Iran claims the protests have ended, however social media still points to signs of unrest.
"Teaching English in government and non-government primary schools in the official curriculum is against laws and regulations," Mehdi Navid-Adham, head of the High Education Council, told state TV on Saturday.
And while the Iranian Revolutionary Guards claimed victory over the protests on Sunday, social media still points to signs of unrest.
