Russia Deplores Foreign Interference in Iran's Protests as "Unacceptable"

TEHRAN (FNA)- The Russian foreign ministry in a statement underlined that any foreign interference in Iran's internal protests cannot be accepted, and expressed the hope that protests in Iran will not turn violent and will not result in bloodshed.

"External interference in Iran's internal affairs which may destabilize the situation is unacceptable," the statement said on Monday while referring to the recent street protests in Iran.

In relevant remarks on Sunday, a deputy governor of the Lorestan province in an interview on state TV aired on December 31 blamed "foreign agents" for the deaths of two demonstrators during the protests a day before.

"No shots were fired by the police and security forces. We have found evidence of enemies of the revolution, Takfiri groups and foreign agents in this clash," he said.

On Sunday, media reported that Tehran had temporarily restricted access to social media apps Instagram and Telegram, used by activists to exchange messages about the rallies.

On Monday, Iranian Information and Communications Technology Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi said that the restricted access to social networks in Iran amid ongoing protests against the government's economic and social policy is a temporary measure.
