During the street protests in 2009, “Death to the dictator” was generally perceived as directed at Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
In addition to Mashhad, there were smaller protests in a few other cities including Birjand, Kashmar, Noushahr, Neyshabour and Yazd.
“Long live Reza Shah”, a reference to the first Pahlavi king who is deemed as the architect of modern Iran.
Reza Shah was also well-known for his secular politics.
Another slogan was “Iran haphazard, without the Shah”, apparently referring to the late king of Iran, Mohammadreza Shah Pahlavi, who was forced into exile in 1979 giving way to the the rise of a theocracy in Iran.
