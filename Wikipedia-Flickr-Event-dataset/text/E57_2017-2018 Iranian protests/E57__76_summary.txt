On Monday, a group of Iranian social media users launched a campaign calling for clarity on the conditions that led to the death of the young protester, Ilna reports.
The authorities imposed restrictions on some social media platforms during the protests.
But on Monday, President Hassan Rouhani spoke out against permanent restrictions on access to social media, and criticised state media reporting of the protests.
The government has lifted restrictions it imposed on Instagram, one of the social media tools used to mobilise protesters.
