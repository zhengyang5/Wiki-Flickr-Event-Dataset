WASHINGTON — As anti-government rallies gather momentum across Iran — taking outside analysts and the Iranian government alike by surprise — President Trump and his foreign policy advisers are likely asking what they can do to support the protesters.
So let me offer Mr. Trump some unsolicited advice: Keep quiet and do nothing.
On Friday night and again on Saturday, Mr. Trump sent out tweets calling on the Iranian government to “respect their people’s rights” and warning that “The world is watching!” That’s more than enough.
At this stage, we have little idea what these protests are really about or where they will lead.
But we can be fairly certain that high-profile public support from the United States government will do more harm than good.
