12/31/17 8:35 p.m. -- In an exclusive interview with VOA Persian on Sunday, Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Communications Michael Anton said there is not much Washington can do about Iran's social media clampdown.

But he said the Trump administration expects U.S. and other Western companies to halt any concessions to the Iranian government.

"(They should) not bow to any demands for censorship or curtailment of information," Anton said. "(They should) continue doing business the way they always have, and let information flow freely into Iran." He added that U.S. officials will be watching how those companies handle the issue.

12/31/17, 8:30 p.m.The Trump administration says it is "very concerned" about Tehran blocking Iranians from communicating via social media platforms in a bid to dampen four days of nationwide anti-government protests.

12/31/17 7:03 p.m. -- Alex Vatanka, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told VOA's United Nations correspondent Margaret Besheer that the Iran protesters are being driven by socio-economic grievances. On the role of social media, it's "certainly a concern to the authorities, but we don’t really know what exact contributing factor it was in terms of that mobilization. … I would say it’s a factor, but it’s too early to say how big of a role it played," he says.

For Iran President Hassan “Rouhani, I think this is a wake-up call for him. Rouhani really has taken the people who voted for him for granted. Nobody really genuinely thought he was a reformist, but hoped that he would at least take certain steps to move in that direction; he’s done none of it. In fact, since his re-election in May, he’s turned toward the right. That has just infuriated those reformists who sort of bought the idea that gradual reform in the Islamic Republic is possible.”

On Iran's youth: “When you look at the footage coming out Iran, is young people -- many of them were born 20 years after the revolution of 1979, they have no sense of what it is this regime does that reflects what they want. They have no historic memory of 1979, what was there before 1979, they don't have any memory of the Iran-Iraq war -- all they know is that they go to university, they work hard to get an education or do whatever it is to lift themselves up in life and there are so many different obstacles in their path," Vatanka tells VOA.

12/31/17 5:18 p.m. -- Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior Iran analyst for Foundation for Defense of Democracies, tells VOA's Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb: "What is true is the Iranian people want accountability, respect, justice, and they want their government to put their interests ... their national interests ahead of the narrow, factional or regime interests. That’s why you heard slogans like, ‘Not Gaza, Not Lebanon. My life for Iran.' ”

"Almost all the protests since the Islamic Republic’s inception, and in many ways almost all the protests in the last century and a half of modern-Iranian history are all linked. And that’s why I think you see much-more strident anti-regime rhetoric in this protest which is clear to say is a continuation of that protest (in 2009).”
