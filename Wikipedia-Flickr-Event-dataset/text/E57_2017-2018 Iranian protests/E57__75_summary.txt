The independent pan-Arab daily newspaper, published in London, learned that the authorities intended to impose house arrest on Ahmadinejad.
Both were responding to Ahmadinejad’s recent anti-government remarks.
In 2013, limited to two terms under the Iranian constitution, Ahmadinejad supported Rouhani’s opponent in the presidential race, but it was Rouhani who won and assumed office.
On April 12, 2017, Ahmadinejad announced his intention to run for a third term, against the objections of the Supreme Leader.
His nomination was rejected by the Guardian Council.
