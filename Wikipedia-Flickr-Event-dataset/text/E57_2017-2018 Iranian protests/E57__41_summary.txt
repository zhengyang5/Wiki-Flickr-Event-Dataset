About 3,700 people were arrested across cities in Iran as a rare wave of anti-government protests and unrest gripped the country, according to a parliament member.
Tehran MP Mahmoud Sadeghi announced the official figure, which is much higher than previous estimates, via the state-run ICANA news agency on Tuesday.
Different security and intelligence forces arrested the protesters, making it difficult to know the exact number of detainees, Sadeghi was quoted as saying.
About 1,000 were previously reported to have been arrested during almost a week of demonstrations that began in December.
