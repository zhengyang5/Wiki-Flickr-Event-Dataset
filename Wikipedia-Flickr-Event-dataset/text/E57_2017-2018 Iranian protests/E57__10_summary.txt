The protests, during which at least 10 people have been killed, are fuelled by disappointment that the lifting of sanctions on Iran in January 2016 has failed to deliver an economic boom.
“There is a crisis of expectations in Iran,” said Tamer Badawi, a research fellow at the Istanbul-based Al-Sharq Forum.
Such austerity has become increasingly unpopular among the public as the economy has struggled despite the end of sanctions.
In some areas of southeast Iran, unemployment among young people has reached 45 percent and the job market is shrinking, he added.
Rouhani’s administration might support the currency by spending more of Iran’s foreign reserves, but this would risk deterring foreign investment; the International Monetary Fund warned against such a policy last month.
