Anti-government protests in Iran, where demonstrations of political unrest are rare, have left at least 20 people dead â€” and do not appear to be subsiding.
Since Thursday, tens of thousands of protesters have formed the largest outpouring of government opposition since the volatile 2009 presidential elections.
Iran has sent cash, weapons and fighters to Syria, for example, and has financially supported Palestinians and the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah.
Media reports that after several days of ongoing anti-regime protests in Iran, the country's Islamic leadership has now organized pro government rallies nationwide.
On Wednesday, tens of thousands of people marched in pro-government rallies called to counter the earlier demonstrations.
