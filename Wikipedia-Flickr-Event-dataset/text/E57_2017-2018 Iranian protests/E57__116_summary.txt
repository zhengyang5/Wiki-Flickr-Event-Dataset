Deputy Chairman of parliamentâ€™s Legal Commission says he has met a teenager in Hamadan province who has received a five-year sentence for bringing down a flag during recent protests in Iran.
Kazemi added that the teenager received the sentence in a lower court and has appealed.
Earlier, several Iranian officials had spoken of school students being arrested during widespread protests that rocked Iran in late December, early January.
In his remarks to Etemad, Kazemi also said that according to Director General of Hamadan province prisons, around forty protesters had been arrested.
It is not clear whether he was referring to those still in detention or the total number of arrested individuals.
