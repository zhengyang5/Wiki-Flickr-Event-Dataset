“People inside are being tortured, maybe tortured to death,” Amir, a 31-year-old activist and business owner, told Fox News in a telephone interview from outside the prison on Tuesday night.
“He was arrested by plainclothes police at the beginning of the protests in Tehran,” Amir recalled.
He also said his detained friend claimed Iranian prison officials are trying to “stage manage” the situation inside the prison, coercing detainees into making filmed statements that they are being treated well.
Another activist, Vahid Heidari, reportedly took his own life Tuesday, while detained in the central Iranian city of Arak.
“Iranian authorities should ensure that all deaths in detention and allegations of ill-treatment are swiftly and independently investigated,” Human Rights Watch said Tuesday.
