Hardly anyone outside Iran doubts the difference between the present protests unfolding in Iran and the previous ones in the country.
(AFP)Both figures, 3,700 detainees and five alleged deaths by suicide upon the AI activists arrival in prisons, are nowhere close to the truth, based on the manner in which the Iranian regime deals with political prisoners.
Instead of rushing to judgment that they committed suicide, the authorities must immediately launch an independent, impartial and transparent investigation, including independent autopsies.”Hardly anyone believes figures provided by the Iranian regime on any matter are accurate.
Members of IRGC Security and Intelligence Unite routinely raped the prisoners indiscriminately as an effective torture tool to break the prisoners.
This time the world cannot afford to let the Iranian regime get away.
