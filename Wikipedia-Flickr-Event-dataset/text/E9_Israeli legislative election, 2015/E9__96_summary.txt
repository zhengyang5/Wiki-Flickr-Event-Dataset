A promise of marijuana in the future in exchange for campaign donations today helped the Aleh Yarok (“Green Leaf”) party net more than NIS 100,000 in donations this week.
The campaign, launched in a YouTube video on Saturday, promises donors who front it campaign donations that they will receive marijuana if and when the day comes that the plant is legalized in Israel.

For NIS 420 (a reference to slang popular with marijuana consumers) donors are eligible to receive 5 grams of marijuana, plus an Aleh Yarok T-shirt and a collectible lighter.
Those who donate NIS 10,000 will get help to “open a coffeeshop,” if and when marijuana is legalized and Israel becomes home to Netherlands-style coffeeshops.
