Sometime early last year, Benjamin Netanyahu realized with a start that he had lost control of the Likud party machine.
Each leads an organized pressure group of primary voters that has had an outsized influence on Likud institutions in recent years.
Netanyahuâ€™s own distaste for vote contractors is rooted in the widespread belief that many of these primary voters will not support the Likud on Election Day.
In a two-week membership drive, Jewish Home saw some 20,000 new members join its ranks, swelling its membership to 77,000, second only to Likud.
Netanyahu now heads toward an uncertain Election Day, facing a resurgent Labor and growing competition from Jewish Home on his right, with one certainty: his own Likud, at least, is emphatically behind him.
