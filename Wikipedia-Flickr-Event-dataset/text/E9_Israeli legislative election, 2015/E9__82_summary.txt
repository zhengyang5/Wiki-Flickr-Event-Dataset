Yesh Atid quick to criticize.
He was followed by MK Orit Struk, MK Zevulun Kalfa and Nachi Eyal.
Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid party was quick to denounce the vote and personally attacked MK Struk as well as Rabbi Dov Lior, Tekuma’s spiritual leader.
“Every Jewish mother should know that if you vote [Naftali] Bennett, you vote Orit Struk,” Yesh Atid charged.
Yesh Atid had clarified that Toporovsky was not implicated in any wrongdoings and was asked to assist the police by providing information.
