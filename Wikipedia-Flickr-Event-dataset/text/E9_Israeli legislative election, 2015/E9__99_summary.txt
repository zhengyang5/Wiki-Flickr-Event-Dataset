Political parties made last-minute tweaks to their lists Thursday – with a few surprises – before the window to submit them to the Central Elections Committee in the Knesset closed in the evening, bringing the total number of parties running in the March 17 vote to 26.
In a surprise move, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chose to appoint former minister and MK Bennie Begin, son of Likud founder and former prime minister Menachem Begin, to the 11th place on the party list.
There was an outpouring of praise and support for the move within the Likud.
Ploskov relied on the party’s help in her reelection bid last January, in which 10 Yisrael Beytenu MKs came to the city to assist in the effort.
The Likud said Kahlon offered a joint list as long as candidates from the two parties would alternate.
