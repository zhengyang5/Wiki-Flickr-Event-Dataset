Mr. Netanyahu indicated that he would still try to lure other parties to the coalition to strengthen it.
The final frenzy of negotiating came after Monday’s surprise announcement that Israel’s unpredictable and ultranationalist foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, would not join the new government.
“It’s more like a soap opera than serious politics,” said Gideon Rahat, a professor of political science at Hebrew University.
Mr. Netanyahu himself will probably double as foreign minister for now.
“I don’t think that something dramatic can be expected.”Mr. Netanyahu, for his part, played down the drama of the approaching deadline.
