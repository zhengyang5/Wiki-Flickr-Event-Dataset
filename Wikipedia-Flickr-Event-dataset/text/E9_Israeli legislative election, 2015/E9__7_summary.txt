Members of Israel’s 19th Knesset voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill to dissolve the parliament, officially putting an end to the current government and paving the way for new elections in March.
“His first mistake was that his call for elections does not serve the Knesset or the Israeli people, and his second mistake is that he will lose,” Lapid said from the Knesset podium.
Meretz MK Issawi Freij vowed March 17 would see a “revolution.”Likud MK Yariv Levin, who drafted the bill to dissolve the Knesset, said the coalition and opposition were both problematic over the term.
“It’s time to put egos away, and work together as a big bloc… with a big Labor Party,” Herzog said in the Knesset Monday.
Meanwhile, Jewish Home and the Likud signed a “surplus votes” agreement — to ensure that no votes cast for the two parties would be lost when the Knesset seats are allocated after elections under Israel’s system of pure proportional representation.
