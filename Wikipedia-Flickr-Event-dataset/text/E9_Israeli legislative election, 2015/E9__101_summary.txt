After weeks of speculation, it seems that former IDF Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz will not join the Labor party.
It is unclear what his political future is as Kadima has yet to cross the electoral threshold in any poll.
This leaves Labor still searching for a security figure for their Knesset list and it is rumored that former head of military intelligence Amos Yadlin is interested.
He would likely be offered either the 11th of 16th spot on the Knesset list.
