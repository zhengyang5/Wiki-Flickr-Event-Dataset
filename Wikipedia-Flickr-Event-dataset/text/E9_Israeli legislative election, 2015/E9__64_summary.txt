After Lapid at number one, the next four slots on the list are taken by Yesh Atid’s ex-cabinet ministers: former education minister Shai Piron, former health minister Yael German, former welfare minister Meir Cohen and former science minister Yaakov Peri.
They are followed by Ofer Shelah, the party’s Knesset faction chair and a close Lapid confidant, at slot six.
Only after Razvozov does the list begin to register changes from the last Knesset.
Dov Lipman, the Knesset’s only serving US-born member, is listed inexplicably as “not final” in the 14th slot on the list leaked to NRG.
The leaked list ends at number 15 with MK Ruth Calderon.
