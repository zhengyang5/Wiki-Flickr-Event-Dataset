Housing Minister Uri Ariel’s far-right Tekumah faction on Sunday selected its Knesset candidates, who are to be incorporated into a joint list with Naftali Bennet’s Jewish Home party in the upcoming elections.
Newcomer Bezalel Smotrich came in second, after Ariel, who ran unchallenged as faction head, followed by MK Orit Strock and MK Zevulun Kalfa.
Smotrich is director of Regavim, an NGO that monitors the use of state land in Israel and the West Bank.
More than 8,000 Jewish settlers were evicted from Gaza and the northern West Bank in 2005 as part of then-prime minister Ariel Sharon’s controversial plan to unilaterally remove all Jewish residents and IDF soldiers from the Strip.
The Tekumah faction joined forces with the Jewish Home in advance of the 2013 elections and holds four of Jewish Home’s 12 seats in the outgoing Knesset.
