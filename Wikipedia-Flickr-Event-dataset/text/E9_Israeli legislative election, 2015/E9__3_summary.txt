Israel's prime minister fired two senior cabinet ministers from his divided government Tuesday, all but guaranteeing new elections more than two years ahead of schedule.
In a statement, Netanyahu's office said he ordered the dismissals of Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni.
I will not tolerate ministers attacking government policy from within the government," the statement quoted Netanyahu as saying.
Critics say the wording that Netanyahu favours would undermine Israel's democratic character and harm the rights of Israel's Arab citizens.
"We are sad to see that the prime minister has chosen to act without consideration for the national interest and to drag Israel to unnecessary elections."
