Court issues injunction against tomorrow's primary elections after candidate accuses party officials of foul play; decision at 8:00 a.m.

The Jewish Home party's primary elections are set to take place tomorrow, after a highly successful recruitment drive. But now, just hours before polling stations throughout the country are set to open, the vote itself may be under threat.

Lod District Court issued a temporary injunction on holding the vote late Tuesday afternoon, and will reconvene at 8:00 a.m. Wednesday morning to decide whether the primaries can go ahead as planned that day.

The injunction was issued in response to a petition by one of the candidates - Attorney Ayal Bar-Lev - who is accusing party officials of foul play.

Bar-Lev claims that underhanded tactics were used to undermine his candidacy for a spot on Jewish Home's Knesset list. Among other things, he says he was prevented from obtaining a list of the party's Central Committee members - a move he insists was deliberately calculated to stop them voting for him.

He also claims that party officials are denying requests to provide a post-vote breakdown of results by polling stations - although in the last few hours the party confirmed it would be doing so.

Sources within the Jewish Home party said they were confident the petition would be rejected tomorrow morning and that the vote would indeed be conducted as scheduled.
