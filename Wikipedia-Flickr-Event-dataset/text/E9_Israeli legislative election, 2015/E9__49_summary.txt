Former IDF Chief of Intelligence Amos Yadlin on Monday evening officially announced his alignment with the Zionist Camp (Labor/The Movement).
Yadlin, who is also a former Deputy Air Force commander, fighter pilot and IDF attach√© to Washington DC, is uninterested in occupying a Knesset seat.
The deal is that if Labor is tapped for the presidential mandate and does successfully establish a coalition, then Yadlin will serve as Minister of Defense.
This is a win/win for Labor for if the party runs the coalition they benefit from Yadlin and they can have another person in Knesset since Yadlin does not wish to be a MK.
A cabinet minister does not have to be a MK.
