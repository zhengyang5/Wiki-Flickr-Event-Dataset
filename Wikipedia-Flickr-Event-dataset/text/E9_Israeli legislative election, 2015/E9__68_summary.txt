MK Rina Frenkel to step down, work for Yesh Atid on the executive side, she announces.
MK Rina Frenkel (Yesh Atid) is retiring from politics, she announced in a mass email to party members Saturday night.
Frenkel is the third MK to quit the party, which is expected to face huge losses during the upcoming March elections.
On Thursday, MK Shimon Solomon announced his own resignation, also opting to work in Yesh Atid on the executive side instead of continuing to serve in the Knesset directly.
Yesh Atid has yet to announce its party list for this round of elections.
