Likud MK Moshe Feiglin decided over the weekend to sit out the March 17 election to focus on building a new party that will compete in the next race after that, he told The Jerusalem Post Sunday night.
Feiglin turned down multiple offers from parties to run together with them.
He will instead focus on building up the new party so it will be ready next time.
“I came to Likud to advance the goals of Manhigut Yehudit [Feiglin’s Jewish leadership organization].When you do something, you need to do it wholeheartedly.You can’t have one foot here and one foot there.
I have to follow what most talks to me and for me it’s the ideology of [Feiglin] that gets me up in the morning.”
