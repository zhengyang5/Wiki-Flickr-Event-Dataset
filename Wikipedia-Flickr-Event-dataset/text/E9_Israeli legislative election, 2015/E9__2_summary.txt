JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clinched a deal to form a new government on Wednesday just before a deadline expired, but his coalition will rule by the slimmest of majorities in Israel’s turbulent parliament.
VULNERABLE TO POLICY DEMANDSSuch a narrow majority will make Netanyahu vulnerable to policy demands from even his most junior partners, continuing a long tradition of instability in Israeli politics.
Shortly after the March 17 election, Netanyahu appeared to be coasting toward a right-leaning government with control of 67 parliamentary seats and voiced confidence he would be able to form one quickly.
Had Netanyahu not met Wednesday’s deadline, the president would have been obligated by law to appoint another legislator to try to form a government.
