Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog said on Wednesday afternoon that after his party's election defeat to the Likud the " only realisticoption" for his party was to be in the opposition.
Herzog's Labor party formed the Zionist Union with Tzipi Livni's Hatnua party hoping that the move would result in an election result that could unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
But the Likud ended up winning 30 Knesset seats to the Zionist Union's 24.
"I learned that Herzog was a brave leader that loves the nation of Israel,"Livni said of her co-leader.
"The Netanyahu dream government is the nightmare government for Israel and therefore we must not give up and we need to fight for our path from the opposition," Livni said.
