An election campaign billboard shifts between images of Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog, right, and Likud Party leader and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Tel Aviv, March 3, 2015.
The elections for the 20th Knesset give the public an opportunity to change the government and bring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus long term to an end.
Netanyahus economic policy caused the defense budget to swell and apartment prices to soar, ignoring the peoples distress.
Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, the leaders of the Zionist Union, are a convincing alternative to the ruling party and the prime minister.
There is a chance to change the rightist rule and put Israel back on the track of political moderation and social integration.
