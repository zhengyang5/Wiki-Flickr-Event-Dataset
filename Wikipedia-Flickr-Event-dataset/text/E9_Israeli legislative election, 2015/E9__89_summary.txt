Rav Ovadia Yosef offered Aryeh Deri third place after Eli Yishai and Ariel Atias, but Deri wants to be #1.
Senior sources in Shas said Sunday that Rav Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of Sephardic haredi party Shas, has offered the number three slot in the party's list to Aryeh Deri, onetime party leader.
However, according to Channel 2 television, which reported about the offer – Deri has rejected the arrangement because he wants to be the party chairman.
Sources in Shas warned that if Deri chooses to run in an independent party, Rav Ovadia will mount a direct attack on him.
However, sources close to Deri insisted that he intends to run for the next elections at the head of a party – either Shas or an independent party.
