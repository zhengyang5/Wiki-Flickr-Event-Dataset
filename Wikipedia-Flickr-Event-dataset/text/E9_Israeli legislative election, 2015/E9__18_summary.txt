For Harari, Tuesday will be the fourth election in which he is helping to organize voting by patients, as well as staff members who can’t get away from their jobs.
Last time, less than two years ago, hundreds of them made an effort to vote and be counted.
The CEC based in the Knesset has reminded every hospital with at least 50 patients about the procedures for arranging the voting in the institution.
Relatives or caregivers can assist the patients, who must choose and cast the ballots themselves, said Harari.Shaare Zedek’s smaller branch at Bikur Cholim Hospital has also prepared for the vote using one of the country’s 82 mobile polling stations.
The Health Ministry has refreshed the memory of administrators in hospitals around the country, sending detailed instructions about facilitating the voting process.
