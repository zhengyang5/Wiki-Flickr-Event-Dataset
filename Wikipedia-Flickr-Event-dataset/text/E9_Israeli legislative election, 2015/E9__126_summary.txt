President Reuven Rivlin will try to facilitate the formation of a national unity government led by the Likud and the Zionist Union after Tuesday’s election but will not force it, sources close to Rivlin said Saturday night.
The sources on Saturday confirmed a report in Friday’s Makor Rishon newspaper that in closed conversations, Rivlin volunteered to mediate between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog at the President’s Residence to help them form a coalition together.
In those conversations, he said that the results predicted by the polls would not indicate a clear victory, making a unity government necessary.
Netanyahu has come out in favor of the idea but would only apply it ahead of the next election.Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett announced Saturday night that his faction would recommend to Rivlin that Netanyahu form the next government.
“I checked all the lists and found that there is only one without a single person who is ethically or morally tainted.”
