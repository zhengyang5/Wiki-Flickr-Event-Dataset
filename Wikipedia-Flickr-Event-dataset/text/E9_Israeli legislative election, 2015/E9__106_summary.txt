This morning, the Times proclaimed a “crushing victory” for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over Zionist Union challengers Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, in yesterday’s election.
In the last national election, in 2013, the five parties that make up Netanyahu’s hard-right “national camp" won sixty-one of the hundred and twenty seats in the Knesset.
It’s true that Netanyahu’s Likud surged to thirty seats, nine more than projected by last Friday’s final poll—the Zionist Union, by contrast, was expected to get twenty-four, and finished with exactly that—but Netanyahu’s gain was not really at Herzog and Livni’s expense.
Yesterday, it seemed possible that, if Herzog and Livni had a plurality of seats, Kahlon would side with them.
But Netanyahu’s strong plurality almost certainly precludes Kahlon’s feeling emboldened to make a majority for the Zionist Union.
