How does Eli Yishai's new party affect the Ashkenazi hareidi camp, and will it go left or right?
On the Sephardic side of the hareidi public, Shas-breakaway Eli Yishai's new party – Ha'am Itanu, The People are With Us - is expected to compete strongly with Shas.
A source in Agudat Israel has been quoted as blaming its partner, Degel, for showing tacit support for Yishai's new party.
MK Moshe Gafni, leader of Degel HaTorah, has said publicly that he would join a Herzog-Livni government – and Agudah feels this is simply another way of driving away votes from the joint Ashkenazi hareidi party.
"Does he [Gafni] not realize that the Chabad camp, which believes strongly in holding onto the Land of Israel, will simply not vote for us?"
