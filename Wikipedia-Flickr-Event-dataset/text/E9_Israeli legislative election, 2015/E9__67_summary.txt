Little more than six months after taking office as Israel’s most popular new political face, a poll published Wednesday found Finance Minister Yair Lapid to be the most disappointing politician of the year.
Opposition leader Shelly Yachimovich (Labor Party) was fourth most disappointing, according to the poll, with 6%.
Lapid, who often addresses the public in lengthy posts on his Facebook profile, made no remark Wednesday in response to the poll, only wishing everyone a happy new year.
Lapid took 14%, Netanyahu 10%, and Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon 8%.
Israel’s public diplomacy, known as “hasbara,” also received poor scores.
