(Haaretz)12:00 P.M. Lieberman: Islamic Movement's northern branch should be outlawedForeign Minister Avigdor Lieberman says the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel is linked to terror groups and should be outlawed in the aftermath of a shooting that left 12 dead in the office of a satirical newspaper in Paris.
Lieberman said that the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, led by Sheik Raad Salah, is "an inseparable link in the chain that includes the terror groups Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, Al-Qaida and ISIS."
The Labor Party is trying to determine whether Mofaz would help the joint Labor-Hatnuah list gain more seats.

Channel 10 on Tuesday reported on Labor Party ads directed at the Arab sector that ostensibly omitted the name Zionist Camp, referring instead to Labor Party for Peace and Equality.
