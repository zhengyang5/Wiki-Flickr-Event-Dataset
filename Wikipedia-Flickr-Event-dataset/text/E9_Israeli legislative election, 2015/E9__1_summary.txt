Netanyahu sent Rivlin a letter confirming that his Likud party had clinched a coalition late Wednesday night, after making the announcement.
Good luck to us and to the Israeli nation.”“We support you,” Bennett told Netanyahu.
Netanyahu and Bennett were negotiating Wednesday over the scope of her authority in the job.
Israel’s Channel 2 reported Wednesday night that Netanyahu really wanted Zionist Union, and not Jewish Home, in the coalition all along, and offered Herzog the post of deputy prime minister.
However, Netanyahu did not want Herzog’s colleague Tzipi Livni in his coalition, and Herzog rebuffed his overtures, the TV report said.
