12:00 P.M. Lieberman: Islamic Movement's northern branch should be outlawed

Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman says the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel is linked to terror groups and should be outlawed in the aftermath of a shooting that left 12 dead in the office of a satirical newspaper in Paris.

"If there's one important lesson we have learned from yesterday's terror attack in Paris is that extremist groups must be dealt with preemptively," Lieberman said in a Facebook post. "Anyone who shows tolerance toward such movements and organizations eventually pays with the blood of innocents, and with a threat on the very democracy that allowed [these groups] to act."

Lieberman said that the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, led by Sheik Raad Salah, is "an inseparable link in the chain that includes the terror groups Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, Al-Qaida and ISIS." (Haaretz)

9:10 A.M. Labor to choose military man for slate after primary

The Labor Party will decide whom to place in the No. 11 spot on the slate reserved for a security-oriented candidate only after the party primary next week. Labor chairman Isaac Herzog has yet to decide whether to reserve the spot for Kadima chairman and former defense minister Shaul Mofaz, or former Military Intelligence chief Amos Yadlin.

The Labor Party is trying to determine whether Mofaz would help the joint Labor-Hatnuah list gain more seats.

The party is continuing to deliberate the name of the joint list. To date it has been calling itself Zionist Camp, but the name has been sharply criticized by peace groups that say it excludes Israeli Arabs, who are not Zionists and would have difficulty supporting the list. Herzogs staff, in fact, sent a message to media outlets Wednesday asking that official statements issued by the joint list be attributed to Labor-Hatnuah headquarters.

Channel 10 on Tuesday reported on Labor Party ads directed at the Arab sector that ostensibly omitted the name Zionist Camp, referring instead to Labor Party for Peace and Equality. The party said Wednesday that that version of the ad had appeared before the merger with Hatnuah and the decision on Zionist Camp was a temporary name.
