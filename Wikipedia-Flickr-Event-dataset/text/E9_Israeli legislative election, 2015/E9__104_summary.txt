The new Knesset will have more female MKs than any that came before it, as 29 women will vote in the new parliament, two more than in the 19th Knesset.
There will also be 38 first-time MKs sworn in, from a wide variety of parties.
The new parliamentarians include Attorney Revital Swid (Zionist Union), known for a number of famous clients, including the Abutbul crime family, as well as Nava Boker (Likud), whose husband was killed in the 2010 Carmel Forest Fire.
Jackie Levy (Likud) will also enter the Knesset, joining his sister Orly Levy-Abecassis, who won another term with Yisrael Beytenu.
