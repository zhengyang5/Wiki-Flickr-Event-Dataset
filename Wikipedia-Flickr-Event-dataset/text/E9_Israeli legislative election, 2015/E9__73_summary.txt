Election committee chair Salim Jubran ruled Monday that Tsega Melaku did not leave her job at a state-run radio station in time to run for a Knesset seat with Moshe Kahlon’s Kulanu party.
Israeli law requires certain senior government employees to wait 100 days between leaving their positions and the date of an election they wish to participate in as a candidate, or, in other words, by December 18, 2014, for the upcoming election.
This is meant to separate the supposedly apolitical nature of civil service with the entirely political nature of political office.
Since leaving Reshet Aleph, Melaku has worked as an editor and presenter for the IBA’s International station.
The Kulanu party tried to convince the election committee that Melaku’s work at the IBA’s International station should not be considered of the sort that would require the 100-day wait.
