A year after the formation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, a Saturday poll found Finance Minister Yair Lapid trailing other ministers in terms of public approval, although not by much, since the ratings for most of the ministers were fairly mediocre.
Lapid came in at number 23 out of 23 ministers in the Channel 2 poll with an average approval rating of 4.19 out of 10.
The most popular figure was Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon — though his score wasn’t exceedingly high either – with 5.89 on the approval scale.
Home Front Defense and Communications Minister Gilad Erdan was at number three with 5.27, and Interior Minister Gideon Sa’ar took fourth place with 5.2.
A poll in late 2013 found him to be the most disappointing politician of the year.
