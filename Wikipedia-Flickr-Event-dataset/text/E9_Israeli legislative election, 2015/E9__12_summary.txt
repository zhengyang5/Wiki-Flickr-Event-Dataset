At exactly 9 AM New Zealand time on Wednesday, Yosef Livne – Israel's ambassador to New Zealand – was the first Israeli to cast his vote for the 20th Knesset .
New Zealand is the first of 96 Israeli diplomatic missions to vote in this year's elections.
Voting will also occur in the smallest consulates, where only two people – the ambassador and the security officer – will cast a ballot.
There will be no voting at the embassy in Cairo this year and all its diplomats will vote in Israel.
In the previous elections in 2013, 87 percent of those living abroad and with voting rights cast a vote.
