Former Likud minister Moshe Kahlon is to call his new political party Kulanu — which translates as “All of us,” Israel’s Channel 2 news revealed on Wednesday night.
At a pub on Friday, Kahlon said he was not opposed to territorial concessions if they were to bring about a peace accord with the Palestinians.
Kahlon, 54, is most famous for his work to open up the mobile telecom industry to competition when he was communications minister from 2009.
He became communications minister in 2009, and replaced Isaac Herzog (Labor) in January 2011 to head the Welfare and Social Services Ministry, where he continued his consumer crusade and fought the banks to lower their tariffs for customers.
Kahlon is the son of Libyan immigrants, and grew up in a rough neighborhood of Hadera as one of seven children.
