Polls have indicated that a majority of the Israeli public has had enough of Mr. Netanyahu, even though he still commands the most support as the most viable candidate for prime minister.
Mr. Herzog and Ms. Livni, both lawyers, are the scions of two storied figures whose careers began during the struggle for independence.
“The rivalry was great,” Ms. Livni said of their families’ opposite positions on the political spectrum.
But she added that both she and Mr. Herzog had grown up in houses that nevertheless shared a joint vision and joint values of patriotism and Zionism.
He added that her alliance with Mr. Herzog would be considered a “dream team” by President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority.
