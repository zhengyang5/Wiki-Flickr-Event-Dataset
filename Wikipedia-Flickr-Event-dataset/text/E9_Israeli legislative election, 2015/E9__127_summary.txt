Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently met with Zionist Union party chief Isaac Herzog to discuss the creation of a national unity government, Channel 1 reported Monday night, prompting a swift denial from Herzog.
“It never was and never will be,” Herzog said, while his party called the report “ludicrous.”According to the report, the meeting was held in secret and close aides on both sides were kept out of the loop.
“Our negotiating team met with Likud’s negotiating team, and we felt like we were being strung along,” he said.
We want to be part of the government, but not at any price.”MK Yariv Levin, who is part of the Likud coalition negotiating team, painted a sobering picture of the talks in an interview with Israel National News radio.
Meanwhile, lawmakers within his own Likud party have also demanded top jobs, citing the party’s strong 30-seat showing, which makes the party the largest by far in the 20th Knesset.
