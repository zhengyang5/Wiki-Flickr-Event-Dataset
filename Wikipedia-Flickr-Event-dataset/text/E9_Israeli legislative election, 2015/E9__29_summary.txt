In a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud party’s internal court struck down on Monday a request to move up the party primaries and barred the prime minister from reserving two slots on the party list for candidates of his choosing.
Moreover, the court denied Netanyahu’s request to reserve the 11th and 23rd slots on the list.
A statement from the Likud’s primaries committee called the ruling “puzzling,” and said the the decision to move up the party leadership vote was done in order to save money.
The Likud Central Committee voted Wednesday in favor of Netanyahu’s proposal to set an earlier date for the party’s primaries.
Sa’ar announced on Thursday that he would not run for the party leadership.
