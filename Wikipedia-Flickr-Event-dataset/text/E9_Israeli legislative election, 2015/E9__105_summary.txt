The vast majority of Israelis want to live in a Jewish state, however they define that.
On Friday night, Mr. Netanyahu’s spokesman issued a statement reiterating how proud the prime minister is of Mr. Dermer.
Mr. Netanyahu belatedly started talking about Israel’s housing crisis in the campaign’s final days, but he didn’t say how he would address it.
Now Mr. Netanyahu has promised to appoint Mr. Kahlon finance minister, and said they will solve the problems together.
Within the new coalition, Mr. Netanyahu must go with either Avigdor Lieberman or the religious parties, with significant policy implications either way.
