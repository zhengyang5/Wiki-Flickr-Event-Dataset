A Likud comptroller disqualified Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from running for the party’s leadership primary next week, in a move that could imperil the prime minister’s chances of competing for another term.
Comptroller Shai Galili cited Netanyahu’s alleged misuse of party funds and other property to advance his candidacy in disqualifying him from the primary.
In a letter to Netanyahu’s attorney, Galili detailed Netanyahu’s use of Likud headquarters to promote his campaign for the party leadership.
A speech given by the prime minister at the event was later uploaded to the party website.
Sa’ar later announced that he would not run for the party leadership.
