Court issues injunction against tomorrow's primary elections after candidate accuses party officials of foul play; decision at 8:00 a.m.
But now, just hours before polling stations throughout the country are set to open, the vote itself may be under threat.
The injunction was issued in response to a petition by one of the candidates - Attorney Ayal Bar-Lev - who is accusing party officials of foul play.
He also claims that party officials are denying requests to provide a post-vote breakdown of results by polling stations - although in the last few hours the party confirmed it would be doing so.
Sources within the Jewish Home party said they were confident the petition would be rejected tomorrow morning and that the vote would indeed be conducted as scheduled.
