U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him on his election victory two days ago, relieving pressure from critics for not embracing the Israeli leader's success sooner.
The call came as the White House continued to push back against Netanyahu's pre-election rejection of a two-state solution to Palestinian-Israeli peace.
On another sensitive subject, Obama addressed negotiations with Iran over Tehran's nuclear program and said he was focused on a deal that would prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, the White House said.
When asked if that means a Palestinian state will not be established if he is elected, Netanyahu replied, "Indeed."
Earnest called it a "cynical election-day tactic that was a pretty transparent effort to marginalize Arab Israeli vote."
