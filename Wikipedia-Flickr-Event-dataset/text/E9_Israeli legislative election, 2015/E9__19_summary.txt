The opposition in the Knesset, or parliament, boycotted the 67-0 vote which supporters said will bring greater stability to government.
Israel’s 120 Knesset seats, now divided among 12 factions, are assigned in proportion to each party’s percentage of the national vote.
The Arab-led parties - Ra’am-Ta’al, the National Democratic Assembly and Hadash - won 11 seats in the 2013 ballot.
Ultra-Orthodox Jews, by contrast, make up about 10 percent of the population but have a high turnout on election days.
The two parties representing them, which for the first time in a decade are not in government, are Shas, with 11 seats, and United Torah Judaism, with seven.
