"I am not an outstanding politician," admits Kadima chairman as he announces that he is stepping down from politics.
Kadima chairman MK Shaul Mofaz officially announced on Tuesday that he is retiring from political life and will not run for the 20th Knesset, though Kadima is still planning to run with a list in the March 17 election.
The glorious legacy of Israel was blessed with deserving leaders and generals, I prefer to be among them," Mofaz said in a statement.
He was replaced by Zellner, who temporarily served as an MK in the previous Knesset as well, replacing Tzipi Livni when she resigned after losing the party leadership to Mofaz.
Mofaz briefly entered Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahuâ€™s coalition in 2012, but quit ten weeks later after he failed to lead a move that would see haredim being drafted into the army.
