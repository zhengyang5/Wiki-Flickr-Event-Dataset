Kulanu leader Moshe Kahlon rebuked his party’s No.
2 figure, Yoav Galant, on Wednesday after Galant suggested that the party would seek an alliance with Yisrael Beytenu’s Avigdor Liberman for coalition negotiations.
Speaking to Israel Radio, Kahlon said he, not Galant, would determine whom the party would work with.
The party did not have agreements with “anyone other than the public,” he said.
Earlier in the week, Galant told a crowd that “I expect the first deal we will make will be with Liberman and our second deal will be with Herzog.”Sitting at the center of the political spectrum, Kulanu may play the role of kingmaker following Tuesday’s election.
