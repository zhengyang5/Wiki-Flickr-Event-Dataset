After sequestering himself in religious studies for the last year, Mr. Deri, 41, pronounced his political career over.
Over the last 15 years, Mr. Deri built from scratch a political, social and religious movement that blossomed into a linchpin political party and Israel's third largest.
Many secular Israelis saw Mr. Deri's behavior as a threat to the rule of law by the leader of a party that answers to divine law first.
''Look what color can do,'' today's posters said, comparing Mr. Weizman's supposed self-imposed punishment -- retirement to his beach house in Caesarea -- with Mr. Deri's jail term.
Those recent political developments fueled the anti-establishment sentiment at Mr. Deri's goodbye party today.
