The new breakaway star in Israel's political center has picked a name for his newly-formed faction: Kulanu ("All of us" in Hebrew).
Moshe Kahlon (Photo: Motti Kimchi)Kahlon, the communications minister in Netanyahu's previous government, defined the current situation as a "diplomatic siege" and said that "the real Likud knows how to concede territory."
Kahlon presented his faction as the pragmatic alternative.
Kahlon hinted that he would support a renewal of the peace process and criticized the prime minister for damaging Israel's international reputation.
Earlier in the week, Kahlon spoke with economics students at Haifa University, where he presented his reasons for breaking away from the Likud.
