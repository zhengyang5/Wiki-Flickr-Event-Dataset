“The public is waiting for us to raise our heads and march on with our way.”First, Israel — and the world — will be watching which way Mr. Netanyahu marches.
There is broad agreement across Israel with Mr. Netanyahu’s critique of the emerging deal between six world powers and Iran over its nuclear program.
“The outcome represents, basically, the fact that Iran decided who will be the prime minister in Israel,” said Yedidia Z. Stern of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research group.
Reviving it, especially after Mr. Netanyahu’s statements against Arabs, could deepen the societal cleavages exposed in the campaign.
It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Herzog, who asked Mr. Netanyahu to endorse this idea when it looked as if the Zionist Union might become the largest party, will still support it.
