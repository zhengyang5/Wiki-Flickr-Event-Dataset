JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's opposition Labor party said Wednesday it is joining forces with a former government partner in a bid to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the country's coming elections.
"Six years of Netanyahu and there are still no answers," Herzog said.
Opinion polls give the joint Herzog-Livni list about 24 seats in the 120-seat Knesset — slightly more than their current total.
That's two or three more seats than polls give Netanyahu, though he retains the option of joining forces with the nationalist Jewish Home Party.
That would give him a bloc of 35-40 seats — probably enough to be asked by Israel's president to try to form the next government.
