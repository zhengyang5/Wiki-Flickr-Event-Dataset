Former Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said on Friday that his biggest mistake as a politician was joining Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s coalition.
Mofaz quit the coalition ten weeks later after he failed to lead a move that would see haredim being drafted into the army.
"We had a coalition of 94 seats - an historic opportunity - and I felt he was lying to me, I could not stay there another minute."
Mofaz added that joining Netanyahu’s coalition was the biggest mistake he made in his political career.
However, shortly before the lists were submitted to the Central Elections Committee, Hasson quit Kadima and joined Moshe Kahlon’s Kulanu party.
