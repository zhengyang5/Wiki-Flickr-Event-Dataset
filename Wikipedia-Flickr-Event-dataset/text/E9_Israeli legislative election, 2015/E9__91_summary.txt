The spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas political party said Saturday night he had promised former party leader Aryeh Deri he would return him to the leadership of the party once Deri left jail.
The revelation from Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef came three days after Deri was given the go-ahead to reassume the party’s leadership, after several months of sitting as one of three Shas political chiefs as part of a power sharing pact.
“It was a deposit that he held, and now he can redeem it,” Yosef said during his weekly Saturday night sermon.
Deri on Sunday echoed Yosef’s use of the word “deposit” to describe Yishai’s role as party chairman.
Yishai had performed “perfectly well” in the post, Deri said, but now it was being restored to him as promised.
