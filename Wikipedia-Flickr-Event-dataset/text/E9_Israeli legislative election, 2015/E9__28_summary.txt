Likud MK Danny Danon submitted his candidacy for the Likud leadership on Monday, becoming the first to challenge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s leadership in the party primaries.
“In the past few years, the Likud movement has gone astray,” Danon said.
MK Moshe Feiglin and former interior minister Gideon Sa’ar are also rumored to have joined the race for the Likud leadership, with primaries scheduled for January 6.
Recent polls show that under Netanyahu, Likud would likely receive over 20 seats.
Likud party sources on Thursday told Channel 10 news that Sa’ar was weighing a comeback to try to oust Netanyahu.
