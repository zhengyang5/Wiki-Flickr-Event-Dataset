Kulanu party leader Moshe Kahlon, whose allegiances following Tuesday’s general election could be pivotal in determining who will form the next government, said Friday that the Likud-led government had failed and should “clear the way”.
Asked about Bennett’s accusations that he was moving leftward and eyeing a government led by Zionist Union chief Isaac Herzog, Kahlon did not mince words.
Meanwhile, former Likud minister Dan Meridor told Yedioth Ahronoth Friday that he would not be voting for his party in the coming election.
Despite this, the prime minister is seen as having a better chance of forming a coalition than Herzog.
Netanyahu acknowledged Thursday that “there’s a real danger” he would be ousted as prime minister.
