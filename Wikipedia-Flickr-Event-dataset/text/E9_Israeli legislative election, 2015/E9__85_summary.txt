Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced his plans to break up the Likud-Beiteinu partnership after escalating disputes with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Jerusalem Post reports.
The partnership, which was formed in 2012, combined Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu’s 11 Knesset seats with Netanyahu’s Likud’s 20 seats, making the super party the largest in the Knesset.
The split would leave Likud with 20 seats, just one more than Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid party.
He said the newly independent Yisrael Beytenu faction would not take any disciplinary steps against the coalition, such as MKs absenting themselves from no-confidence motions.
But we do expect changes in the fight against terror.”Previous: Avigdor Lieberman Speaks Russian in BrooklynAvigdor Lieberman: Peacenik?
