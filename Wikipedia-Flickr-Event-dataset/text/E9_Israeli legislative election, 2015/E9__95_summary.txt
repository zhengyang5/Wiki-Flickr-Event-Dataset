There will be a party to the right of Bayit Yehudi that is running in the March 17 election, right-wing activists Itamar Ben- Gvir and Baruch Marzel decided over the weekend.
In last year’s election, their Strong Israel party (Otzma LeYisrael) narrowly failed to cross the 2 percent threshold.
Now that the threshold has been raised to 3.25%, the party’s council decided to run under the name the Jewish Strength party (Otzma Yehudit).
But Ben- Gvir said running together with Bayit Yehudi was not an option.“Bennett is not right-wing,” Ben-Gvir said.
His ideology is clearly not ours.”Former MK Arye Eldad’s Hatikva party is to decide on January 1 whether to run with the Jewish Strength.
