Israel’s Arab parties, Balad and Ra’am-Ta’al, signed a unity deal with the socialist, Arab-Jewish Hadash party and the Islamic Movement Thursday night, to run on a single ticket in March’s Knesset elections.
The party will be headed by Haifa attorney Ayman Odeh, a political newcomer who was elected head of Hadash — the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality — on Saturday.
He will be followed on the list by Ra’am-Ta’al representative Masud Ghnaim and Balad head Jamal Zahalka, respectively.
Seats 12 and up will alternate between Ta’al and the Islamic Movement.
Recent polls have shown that a joint Arab-majority party would garner up to 12 seats in the upcoming March 17 elections.
