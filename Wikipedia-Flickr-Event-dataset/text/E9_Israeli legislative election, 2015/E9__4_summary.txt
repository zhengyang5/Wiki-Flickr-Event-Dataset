JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, enmeshed in a cabinet crisis, said on Monday he would call an early national election unless rebellious ministers stopped attacking government policies.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives to the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem November 30, 2014.
The divisions have prompted speculation that Netanyahu will bring forward an election that is not scheduled until 2017.
“I demand these ministers stop their undermining, stop the attacks,” Netanyahu added.
The last parliamentary election was held in January 2013, with Netanyahu then taking two months to piece together a five-party coalition government.
