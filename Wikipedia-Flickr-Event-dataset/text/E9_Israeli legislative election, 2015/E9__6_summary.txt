The election for Israel's 20th Knesset will be held on March 17, Knesset faction heads decided on Wednesday.
Final approval of the date must still be given by members of the factions themselves, Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein said.
The vote came a few hours after the bill passed a preliminary Knesset reading, with a 84-0 vote in favor, and one abstention.
Observers believe Netanyahu is aiming for as short an election campaign as possible.
He made a fool of himself and failed in his effort to lure the ultra-Orthodox into a revolt against the prime minister.
