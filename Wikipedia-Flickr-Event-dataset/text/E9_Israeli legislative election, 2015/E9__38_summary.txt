"I think that anyone who moves to establish a Palestinian state and evacuate territory gives territory away to radical Islamist attacks against Israel," Netanyahu said.
"The left has buried its head in the sand time and after time and ignores this, but we are realistic and understand."
During a visit to the East Jerusalem settlement of Har Homa earlier Monday, Netanyahu warned that if he were not elected, "Hamastan B."
"I said to him â€“ have you ever been in Har Homa?
These are the people telling us who needs to be in government, these are the people who think Har Homa is in Sinai."
