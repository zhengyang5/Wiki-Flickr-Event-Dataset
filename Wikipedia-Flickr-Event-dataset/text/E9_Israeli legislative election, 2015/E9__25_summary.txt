In a surprise move on the final day for which party slates can be submitted for the March 17 elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday named Benny Begin to the 11th slot on the Likud list.
Begin, a respected former minister and son of the first Likud prime minister Menachem Begin, lost his Knesset seat after failing to win a sufficiently high slot on the 2013 Likud slate, and did not compete in the party primaries this time.
Netanyahu had toyed with several other potential candidates for the two slots on the list left open for his preferences.
Netanyahu praised Begin as a symbol of the Likud party and its values, and a man deeply committed to the State of Israel and its security, Israel Radio reported.
Kahlonâ€™s people wanted seven or eight slots in the first 20 places on the joint list, a price said to be too steep for the Likud to pay.
