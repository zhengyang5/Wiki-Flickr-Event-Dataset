Rabbi Misha Zinkow at Temple Israel in Columbus, Ohio, said that one of his foremost concerns was “the lack of engagement of North American Jews with Israel” — a trend that he sees expanding among younger Jews.
Those statements appealed to emotions that young American Jews just don’t have, and they sound racist.”He was planning in his Friday night sermon to talk about the relationship between American Jews and Israel.
And of course, plenty of American Jews were not disappointed by the election results.
My congregation is like the majority of American Jews.
“Having Israel so isolated and marginalized in so many places is profoundly troubling,” said Rabbi Richard Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism.
