After the votes are counted, the poll committee gives them to the regional committee, which checks their count and the protocols.
On the following Wednesday, Central Election Committee chairman Justice Salim Joubran and Director- General Orly Ades will give the official results to President Reuven Rivlin.The calculation that turns votes into 120 Knesset seats is called the Bader-Ofer method, after former MKs Yohanan Bader (Gahal) and Avraham Ofer (Alignment).
The formula is known internationally as the Hagenbach-Bischoff method.The process allows two parties to reach a vote-sharing agreement for dealing with excess votes.
In this Knesset, such deals were struck between Likud and Bayit Yehudi, Yisrael Beytenu and Kulanu, Shas and UTJ and Zionist Union and Meretz.
Which pair of lists receives each additional seat is calculated by dividing the number of valid votes given to both lists that made an agreement, plus one.
