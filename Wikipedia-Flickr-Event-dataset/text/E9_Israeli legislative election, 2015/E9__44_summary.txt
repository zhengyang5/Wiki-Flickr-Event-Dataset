One of Israel’s leading environmentalists for the past two decades, Yael Cohen Paran is eager to bring her grassroots momentum to the Knesset floor as a new Labor-Hatnua joint list candidate.
Hatnua head Tzipi Livni announced on Sunday evening that Cohen Paran would be receiving the 24th spot on the Labor-Hatnua joint list.
In 2009, Ben Yemini and Tal were second and third on a combined list with the Meimad party, but the list ended up winning no seats in that election.
“Leaving a monopoly like this is very dangerous.”Acknowledging that breaking up the monopoly in the Leviathan basin could cause some lag time in its development, Cohen Paran suggested a solution could involve temporarily extracting more gas from the neighboring Tamar reservoir.
“Otherwise, the gas companies will do whatever they want for the next years.” Cohen Paran said her strengths lie in “bringing people from different sides to work together.”
