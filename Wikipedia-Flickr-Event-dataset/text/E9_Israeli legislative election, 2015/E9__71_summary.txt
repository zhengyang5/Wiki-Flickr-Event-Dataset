“We need a new political party, because politics [today] are unclean,” Kahlon, who resigned as communications minister in October 2012, three months before the last general election, said during a speech at Haifa University.
“The individuals who will form the list [for the party] will not seek power and authority, and will be determined, experienced and not corrupt,” he said.
His new political party is expected to focus on reducing the cost of living in Israel.
Many who emigrate from Israel point to the cost of living as a key factor in their decision.
A July Knesset Channel poll showed a theoretical Kahlon party garnering six seats if elections were held then, while this week polls have shown him hovering around 10-12 Knesset seats.
