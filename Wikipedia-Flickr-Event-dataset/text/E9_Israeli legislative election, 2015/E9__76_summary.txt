JERUSALEM (AP) — The coming Israeli election amounts to a referendum on Benjamin Netanyahu — hard-headed defender of Israel to some, the man who buried dreams of peace to others.
Under Netanyahu, Israel is a nation in bunker mode: The mindset is one of furrowed brows, distrust of outsiders, and vigilance against anti-Semitism.
When the Likud plus its natural allies on Israel's political right — smaller nationalist and religious parties — have a majority, the Likud leader governs.
At a news conference after he was fired, Lapid predicted that Netanyahu will not remain prime minister after the vote.
Israel's new President Reuven Rivlin, another Likud veteran who appears to have turned on Netanyahu, has reached out to this population as well.
