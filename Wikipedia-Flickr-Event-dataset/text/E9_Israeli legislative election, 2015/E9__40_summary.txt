Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he regrets issuing a warning to his supporters ahead of the country's elections last week that Arab voters were heading to the polls "in droves."
At an event hosted at the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said he recognized the comment hurt Israeli Arabs, and that it was not his intention to do so, as Haaretz first reported.
"I see in all Israeli citizens partners in building the state of Israel, one that is thriving and safe for all Israeli citizens."
Netanyahu avoided issuing any sort of mea culpa, even after the Obama administration called Netanyahu's comments "cynical" and "divisive."
The Joint Arab List, however, will be the third-largest party in the Knesset and the second-biggest faction in the opposition.
