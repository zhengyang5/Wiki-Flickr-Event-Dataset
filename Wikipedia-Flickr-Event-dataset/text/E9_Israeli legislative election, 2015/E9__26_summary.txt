CloseIf Saar were to be successful in his party leadership bid, it could put him in a position to be elected prime minister in March.
Saar has managed to sow uncertainty among the partys activists and Knesset members about his intentions.
On the other hand, associates of Saar say they dont think he intends to challenge the prime minister for the partys leadership and is merely seeking to put the prime minister under pressure.
Saar would not run, one senior Likud Knesset member who is considered close to the former interior minister flatly predicted on Tuesday.
Netanyahus plan would likely mean that at least one current Likud Knesset member would not be ranked high enough to be assured re-election when the country goes to the polls on March 17.
