The Shas Council of Torah Sages Monday night rejected a request by party chairman Aryeh Deri that he be permitted to resign as chairman of the party.
Deri's request was the latest bombshell in a long-running feud between Deri and former party leader Eli Yishai.
It followed the release on Sunday of recordings of damning statements by the late Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the party's founder and spiritual leader.
No one has anything on Yishai, Yosef said to his confidantes.
and is meant to "restore" the memory of Rabbi Ovadia.
