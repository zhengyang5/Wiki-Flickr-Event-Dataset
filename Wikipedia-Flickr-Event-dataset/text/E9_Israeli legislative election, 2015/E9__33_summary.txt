The top Likud court instructed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday evening to temporarily dismiss three of his advisers, who also hold positions in the party management, until after the primary elections, which are scheduled to take place on Wednesday.
The move paves the way for Netanyahu to run in the Likud primary after he was disqualified last week by the party’s comptroller, Shai Galili, who said that Netanyahu’s conduct was in violation of Israel’s Parties’ Law.
The advisers will be on leave at least until Wednesday midnight, unless the primary ends in a stalemate and a second round is declared.
The party comptroller has the authority to disqualify candidates for violating the Parties’ Law.
Galili said he was aware of the unusual implications for the Likud of his threat to disqualify Netanyahu from running in the party primaries.
