Story highlights President talks with Huffington Post about Israeli leader

Interview covers Netanyahu stance on two-state solution, Arab voters

Washington (CNN) It doesn't matter how many times Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now says he still wants a two-state solution with the Palestinians. The White House is refusing to take him at his word.

"We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region," President Barack Obama said in an interview with The Huffington Post published Saturday.

These are the President's first public comments since Netanyahu's party captured the most seats in Tuesday's parliamentary election.

Netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in Palestinian statehood, despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes.

Only on Thursday, two days after the election, did President Obama congratulate Netanyahu by phone on his victory.
