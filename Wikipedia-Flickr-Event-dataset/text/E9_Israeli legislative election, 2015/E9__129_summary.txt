JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has received a two-week extension to form a new governing coalition following his election victory last month.
Netanyahu told the Israeli president he has made progress in negotiations with potential partners but needs more time to form a stable coalition.
The Israeli leader has held weeks of negotiations with his nationalist, religious and ultra-Orthodox Jewish allies.
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin granted Netanyahu the extension Monday.
Under Israeli election rules, if Netanyahu fails to form a coalition after that time, Rivlin can task someone else to do so.
