The vote came about after Netanyahu, 65, called snap elections late last year as his fractious coalition government teetered on the brink of collapse.
The veteran right-wing leader is not certain to come first in the vote, with the final opinion polls Friday giving the center-left Zionist Union led by Isaac Herzog a 3-4 seat lead over Netanyahu.
But the surveys also showed Netanyahu could have an advantage when it comes to piecing together a coalition with smaller allies from the right.
In an attempt to woo voters away from smaller right-wing parties, he also vowed to increase construction in East Jerusalem, and said the city would never be divided.
A vote for Yesh Atid, is a vote that will help Netanyahu,‚Äù the Zionist Union head told Channel 10 news Monday.
