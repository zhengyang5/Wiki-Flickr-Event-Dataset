For the first time in Israeli political history, a political party led by Haredi women has declared its intention to run in the upcoming elections.

The party will be led by Ruth Kuliak, a social activist who has worked to promote the advancement of women. After her, legal expert Noa Erez, and in third place, 21 year old Business Administration student Keren Mozen.

The party, to be named “Bizchutan” (“in their merit”), was announced by the three founders today at the Zionist Organization of America headquarters in Tel Aviv.
