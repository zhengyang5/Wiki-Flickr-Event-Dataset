Two Egyptians Killed, One Severely Injured in Paris AttacksTwo Egyptian citizens were killed in Paris on Friday in a series of shootings and suicide bombings that claimed at least 129 lives.
Terrorist group ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement widely circulated on social networking sites.
Following the attacks, French President François Hollande issued a state of emergency and closed the country’s borders in the wake of what he called “unprecedented terrorist attacks”.
Hollande promised to “lead a war which will be pitiless” against the terrorist group, declaring three days of national mourning following the attacks.
Egypt also lit the Giza Pyramids with the flag of France, alongside those of Lebanon and Russia, in a gesture of solidarity with all victims of terrorist attacks.
