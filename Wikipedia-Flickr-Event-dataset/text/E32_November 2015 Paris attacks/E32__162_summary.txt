Jeremy Moulin had been walking with friends near the Bois de Vincennes in Paris when the texts started flashing on his cellphone about the terrorist attacks.
The Paris attackers were mostly French citizens residing in France and Belgium, and coordinating with the Islamic State in Syria.
Mr. Hollande deployed 10,000 soldiers on the streets of Paris and other cities the day after the attacks.
Many French were also moved to enlist after January’s attacks on Charlie Hebdo and the Hyper Cacher supermarket and in a Paris suburb, in which 17 people were killed.
“The Charlie Hebdo attacks didn’t necessarily unite people,” he said, noting that the killings were political in nature.
