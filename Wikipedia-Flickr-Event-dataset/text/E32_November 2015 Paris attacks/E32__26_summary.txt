Seven assailants died in the Paris assault, six of them by detonating suicide vests and the other shot by police.
But Abaaoud turned to petty crime, spent time in jail in Belgium and fell under the influence of extremist Islam.
Abaaoud went to Syria and became an online recruiter of European militants before evolving into a clandestine operative, planning attacks in Europe.
On at least one occasion he was reported to have been killed in Syria, possibly as a ruse to keep him off law enforcement radar and help him enter Europe.
Times staff writer Brian Bennett in Washington and special correspondent Clara Wright in Paris contributed to this report.
