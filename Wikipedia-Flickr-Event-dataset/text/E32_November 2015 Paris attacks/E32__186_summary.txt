France will receive 30,000 refugees in the next two years, president Francois Hollande confirmed Wednesday (18 November).
The figure had first been announced by prime minister Manuel Valls in September.
Hollande reminded his listeners that "France accepted playing its part in showing solidarity towards these refugees and towards Europe" and confirmed that "30,000 will be welcomed in the next two years".
On Wednesday, the new Polish right-wing prime minister Beata Szydlo renewed criticism over the EU refugee relocation mechanism.
The views of the new Polish government echo those of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban.
