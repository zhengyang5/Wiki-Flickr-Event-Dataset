Friday's Paris attack and the 2008 terror strikes in Mumbai have similarities.
"In Paris, they were dying fast," he said.
"The Paris attacks seem to be a replica of the Mumbai attacks or you can say the Mumbai operation was the blueprint," he said.Param Bir Singh, former state ATS DIG, now the Thane police commissioner, said that since 26/11, attackers have been looking for soft targets at public places and hotels to inflict large casualties.
The only different thing: In Mumbai, the terrorists carried hand grenades and were killed by the police.
In Paris, the terrorists, after staging the attacks blew themselves up," said Singh.
