PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators have confirmed that Belgian-Moroccan Chakib Akrouh, who blew himself up when trapped by police on November 18, was the third member of the three-man unit that killed dozens of cafe-goers during a multipronged Islamist attack on Paris days earlier.

In that siege in St Denis, on the northern outskirts of Paris, police killed two others - the suspected ringleader of the attacks, another Belgian-Moroccan named Abdelhamid Abaaoud and his cousin, a woman named Hasna Aitboulahcen.
The most deadly of the Nov. 13 attacks was at the Bataclan rock venue where all three attackers died after killing 90 concert-goers.
Beyond the Bataclan and cafe attacks, a third group of three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France sports stadium north of Paris.
