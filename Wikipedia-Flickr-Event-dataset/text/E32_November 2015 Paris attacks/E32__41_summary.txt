The Islamic Stateâ€™s Egyptian affiliate claimed responsibility for the Oct. 31 destruction of a jetliner full of Russian vacationers from the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.
Thursday was also punctuated by new offensives in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State.

The pro-Assad alliance says the United States is not serious about fighting the Islamic State.
A double bombing last year near an Iranian cultural center in the Hezbollah enclave killed at least five people and wounded dozens.
