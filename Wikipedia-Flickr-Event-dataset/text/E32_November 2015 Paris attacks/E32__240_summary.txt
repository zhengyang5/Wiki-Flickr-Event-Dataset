NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reported that U.S. officials say Abdeslam "is injured in the leg ... but is coherent and being treated."
Three of those taken into custody are "members of the family that hid Salah Abdeslam," Van Der Sypt said.
Teri Schultz, reporting from Brussels, told our Newscast unit that Abdeslam's fingerprints were found in a separate raid on Tuesday.
Abdeslam has been the subject of an international manhunt since fleeing back to Brussels after the attacks in Paris.
