U.S. authorities believe the suicide blasts during a soccer game at the packed Stade de France, the national stadium just north of Paris, were meant to "send a statement" because the two teams participating — France and Germany — are Christian countries and because the French president was attending the match.



"But the killing of hostages at the theater was a slaughter," said one of the U.S. sources. "It was about a high kill number."



Islamic State said in a statement that "youth who divorced from the world and went to their enemy" had targeted "the hearts of the Crusaders" and unleashed "horror in the middle of their land."



It said the attacks were in retaliation for French airstrikes on Islamic State-controlled territory in the Middle East, and that France would remain at the "top of the list" of its targets.



French officials, including Hollande, have publicly blamed the attacks on Islamic State.



But the U.S. sources said the multiple sites and soft, crowded targets in the attacks are indicative of Al Qaeda rather than Islamic State. They stressed that authorities still are trying to pin down which organization was behind the attacks.



"Who planned this? Who paid for this?" said one source. "That's what we want."
