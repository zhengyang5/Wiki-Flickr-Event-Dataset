There is no doubt about it,” the French president, François Hollande, told reporters in Brussels before leaving a European council summit to return to Paris.
A decapitated body with a message written on it was found at the scene in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near Lyon in the south-east of the country, Hollande said.
Various reports identified the dead man as the manager of a transport firm, whose company often made deliveries to the Air Products factory.
Hollande said the apparent intention of the attack had been to blow up the factory.
