The suspect, a 27-year-old Belgian, has fought for the Islamic State in Syria and has been linked to other terrorist attacks.
It was the country’s most intense military strike yet against the radical group, which has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Paris.
He is among the most prominent Islamic State fighters to have come out of Belgium.
Mr. Abaaoud, this official said, had also been in contact with Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, one of the Paris attackers.
Mr. Abaaoud also knew another attacker, Ibrahim Abdeslam; they were tried together in 2010 in Belgium for a minor offense.
