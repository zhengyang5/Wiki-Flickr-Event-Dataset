Ahmed Shaheed, a fighter with al-Nusra Front - al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria - told Middle East Eye that the attacks in Paris were to be expected following France's bombing of Islamic State in Syria.
Despite Nusra's longstanding rivalry with Islamic State (IS), Shaheed said they would stand with them against "tyrants".
In response to a question about possible similar attacks by Nusra on the West, Shaheed said he was just a "simple soldier".
