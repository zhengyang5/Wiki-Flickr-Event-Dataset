Soldiers patrolled the streets as a manhunt continued for the fugitive Salah Abdeslam, who is wanted in connection with last week's attacks.
The Belgian authorities placed Brussels on its highest level of alert late on Friday.
Friends of Abdeslam told ABC News they had spoken to him on Skype and said he was hiding in Brussels and desperately trying to get to Syria.
Dahmani is believed to have been in contact with the suspects who carried out the Paris attacks, an official said.
There was no record of any warning from Belgian authorities about him, which is why he was allowed into Turkey, the official said.
