Mr. Molins suggested that the raid might have averted another terrorist attack, given the determination and organization shown by the group and the extent of its weaponry.
The authorities pored over telephone and banking records, Mr. Molins said.
Mr. Molins said a cellphone found in a trash can near the Bataclan concert hall, where 89 people died Friday, had led the police to the Alfortville hotel.
Belgium, where Mr. Abaaoud is believed to have organized the attacks, remained on a state of high alert on Wednesday.
In Molenbeek on Wednesday, some 2,000 people gathered in the market square, not far from where Mr. Abaaoud grew up, to mourn the victims of the Paris attacks.
