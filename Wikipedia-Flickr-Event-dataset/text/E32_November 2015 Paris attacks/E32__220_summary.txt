Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says the country is about to enter "a year of economic prosperity" (AFP Photo/Atta Kenare)Tehran (AFP) - Hassan Rouhani postponed Saturday what would have been the first visit to Europe by an Iranian president in 10 years after attacks in Paris he described as "crimes against humanity".
Rouhani sent a message of condolence to French President Francois Hollande on the shootings and bombings in Paris that killed at least 128 people, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported.
Some held banners in solidarity with the victims and their families including "Je suis Paris" and "The whole world is in mourning."
"The Paris events show once again that terrorism and extremism are an international threat and that international cooperation is necessary to fight this phenomenon."
Iran is also a major backer of Iraq in its war against the jihadists, but operates independently of a US-led coalition.
