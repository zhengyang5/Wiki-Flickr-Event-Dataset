A massive series of terror attacks in and around Paris left over 120 people dead across six sites Friday, including at least eight attackers with unknown motivations.
At least 100 people were killed at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris' 11th arrondissement, where scores of hostages had been held.
Police in Paris told NBC News that several people had also been shot at a restaurant in the nearby 10th arrondissement in Paris.
At the concert hall, the attackers opened fire on a crowd waiting to hear American rock band Eagles of Death Metal perform.
The Paris prosecutor Francois Molins' office said that eight attackers were dead, seven of them via suicide bombing.
