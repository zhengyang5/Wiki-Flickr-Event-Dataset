Another man arrested, Monir Ahmed Alaaj, was also on a wanted list, Belgian prosecutors said.
One of Europe's most wanted men, Abdeslam is a key suspect in the jihadist attacks in Paris in which 130 people died.
One man - identified as Algerian national Mohamed Belkaid and linked to the Paris attacks - was shot dead in Tuesday's raid.
The false ID was also used four days after the Paris attacks at a Western Union office in Brussels to transfer money to Hasna Aitboulahcen.
Abdeslam, a 26-year-old French national born in Brussels, had lived in Molenbeek before the Paris attacks.
