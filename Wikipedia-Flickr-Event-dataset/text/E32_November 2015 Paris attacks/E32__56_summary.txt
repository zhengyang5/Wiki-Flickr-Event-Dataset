The suicide bombers who carried out attacks in Paris Friday night used an explosive called triacetone triperoxide, Paris prosecutor Fran√ßois Molins said Saturday.
TATP was used to make the bombs for the failed 21 July, 2005, attacks on London.
It probably would have had the same effect as the deadly bombs used in London two weeks earlier, which were perpetrated with a different explosive.
TATP was also used by Richard Reid, the would-be "shoe bomber" on a Dec. 22, 2001, flight from Paris to Miami.
The highly unstable nature of TATP has led to bombs inadvertently backfiring on attackers.
