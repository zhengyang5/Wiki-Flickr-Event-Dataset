DAMASCUS, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Saturday condemned the terror attacks in Paris a day earlier, saying the French are suffering the same terror as the Syrians have been, according to the pan-Arab al-Mayadeen TV.
"What France suffered from savage terror is what the Syrian people have been enduring for five years," Assad reportedly said during his meeting on Saturday with a visiting delegation of French lawmakers, according to al-Mayadeen.
In a jab at France, the embattled leader said "the wrong policies of the West, including France, in the Arab region have contributed to the spread of terrorism."
The Syrian government has for long accused the West of supporting the insurgency against Assad's rule, deeming such actions as a "support of terror."
France has been the target of terrorist attacks following its military offensive in Mali, Iraq and Syria.
