One suspect dead, at least one still at large after Brussels terror raidAt least one suspect is still at large after an anti-terror raid by Belgian and French police officers investigating Novemberâ€™s Paris attacks was met with heavy-weapon gunfire that left four police officers wounded.
An official said that another suspect was found dead when police stormed a Brussels apartment at the centre of the raid, where suspects had opened fire on police.
In the mid-afternoon, a police spokeswoman told French television that gunmen were at large.
Abdeslam, believed to have played a key role in organising the Paris attacks, has been on the run since November.
Abdeslam was reportedly holed up in an apartment in the Schaerbeek district in north Brussels for three weeks after the Paris attacks.
