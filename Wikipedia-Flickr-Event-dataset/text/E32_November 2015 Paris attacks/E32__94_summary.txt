The Al-Hayat media group (daesh) has posted a link and explanation on how to get to their new darknet site today on the Shamikh forum (jihadi bulletin board in the clearnet) and linked it to Twitter as well to search for how to’s and links.
The site mirrors many of the other standard bulletin boards that the jihadi’s have had over the years replete with videos and sections in all languages.
It’s a hard game to play and unfortunately with da’esh using this it will be hard to break.
Another problematic thing about da’esh now having a real site in the darknet is that all the videos and files that they want to upload and have users access will also be in some backend on the darknet.
The site is still being explored and mirrored so once I have more on it I will post.
