Turkey warned France twice in the past year about Omar Ismail Mostefai, one of the identified attackers in the Paris terrorist attacks, but there was no response from French authorities, a government official said.
In 2013, Mostefai entered Turkey - which shares its long southern border with Syria - but there is no record of him leaving, the official said.
France believes the Paris attacks were planned in Syria.
"The case of Omar Ismail Mostefai clearly establishes that intelligence sharing and effective communication are crucial to counter-terrorism efforts," according to the Turkish official.
Turkey has blamed Daesh for two terrorist attacks this year, including twin suicide bombings in Ankara in October which killed 102 people at a peace rally.
