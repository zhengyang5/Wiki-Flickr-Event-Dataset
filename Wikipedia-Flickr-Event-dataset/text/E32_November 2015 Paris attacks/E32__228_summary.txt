A newspaper claims to have seen a copy of a detailed dossier on the planned attacks in Hannover that was passed to the German authorities by French intelligence just two hours before kick-off.
The dossier gives details of a plan by a five-member terror cell led by a German citizen to target the football match in a series of coordinated bomb attacks.
One member is a woman, according to the newspaper report, while another is named as Faiz A.

It was not a planned suicide attack: the woman was to leave on another train after placing the bomb.
