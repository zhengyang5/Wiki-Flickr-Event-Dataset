A Paris concert hall where Islamic State militants killed and injured scores of people has long been a target of anti-Zionist radicals, Jewish and French media reported Saturday.
The Bataclan theater where ISIS fighters held dozens of hostages Friday night was Jewish-owned for decades, but was sold two months ago, its former owners said.
The theater often hosted pro-Israel events that drew fierce opposition, including last monthâ€™s conference of approximately 500 Christian Zionists.
The Eiffel Tower was dark Saturday night as France struggled to recover from its deadliest attack since World War II.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said three groups of attackers, including seven suicide bombers, carried out the "act of barbarism."
