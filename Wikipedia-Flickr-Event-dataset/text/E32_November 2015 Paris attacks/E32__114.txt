(CNN) The Paris attacks that killed at least 129 people continued to prompt raids and arrests in Europe and airstrikes in Syria . They've also spurred pledges of support from around the globe, while skepticism of Syrian refugees is sprouting in a number of American states.

Many nations also find themselves at heightened terror alerts after ISIS released a video promising more attacks and the CIA director said Paris wasn't likely a "one-off event."

Here's the latest we've learned from officials and local news reports:

The latest

-- NEW: French warplanes carried out a new round of airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria on Tuesday, the French Defense Ministry said. Activists had previously reported a series of aerial bombings early Tuesday in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, in northern Syria. There were seven airstrikes and at least three major explosions, according to the collective known as Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which has documented ISIS atrocities in the city. The French military had already conducted a series of airstrikes in Raqqa on Sunday and Monday.

-- At least 26 U.S. states have said they won't accept any refugees from Syria. The State Department said it is taking the governors' concerns seriously, but it remains "steadfastly committed" to bringing in 10,000 refugees next year, spokesman Mark Toner said. Officials in six states say they'll continue accepting Syria's refugees.

The investigation

-- Three teams of terrorists staged coordinated attacks at six locations throughout Paris late Friday, including a concert hall, the Stade de France and at least two restaurants, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. At least 352 people were wounded in the attacks, 99 of them seriously. Seven terrorists were killed, one fewer than ISIS said were involved, Molins said.

-- The Paris attacks were planned in Syria and organized in Belgium, French President Francois Hollande said. Six of the Paris attackers spent time in Syria, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV in France.

-- Authorities have said they believe at least one suspect in the attacks is still on the loose. Salah Abdeslam was stopped near the Belgian border by French police shortly after the Paris attacks Friday night, but he was not a suspect at that time and was let go, sources told CNN.

-- Two cars -- a black Seat, and a black Volkswagen Polo registered in Belgium -- appear to have been used in the Paris attacks. The Polo was rented by Salah Abdeslam, who was in a different vehicle when he was intercepted at the Belgian border, and the Seat was found in the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil with three Kalashnikov automatic rifles inside, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.

-- The dead attackers identified by officials so far are 28-year-old Samy Amimour, 29-year-old Ismael Omar Mostefai and Bilal Hadfi, who sources say was 19 or 20.

-- The French newspaper Le Monde reports that Ibrahim Abdeslam, Salah's older brother, was a suicide bomber whose explosives detonated at a cafe on boulevard Voltaire in eastern Paris. The Paris prosecutor's office has identified that attacker as a 31-year-old French citizen but hasn't disclosed his name.

-- The Paris attackers rented an apartment in the suburb of Bobigny for a week before they launched Friday's coordinated series of shootings and explosions, according to multiple reports in French media. The apartment was reportedly rented by Ibrahim Abdeslam.

-- Twenty-three people are in custody and weapons, including a rocket launcher, and IT equipment have been seized after more than 150 police anti-terror raids were carried out in cities across France since Friday, said French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who has ordered 104 people be put under house arrest.

-- Five of seven people detained over the weekend in Belgium were released by a judge, officials said. The two still detained are under arrest for "attempted terrorism and participation in the activities of a terrorist group," the country's federal prosecutor said.

-- Mohammed Abdeslam, the brother of suspects Salah and Ibrahim Abdeslam, was among the five people released. He told CNN affiliate BFMTV that his parents are in shock and "do not realize yet what has happened. My family and I are affected by what happened. We found out by TV just like many of you. We did not think for a moment that one of our brothers was related to these attacks."

The scene in Paris

-- The iconic Eiffel Tower lit up in Paris Monday in the colors of the French flag. Other landmarks around the world have done the same in a showing of solidarity. "Tonight, we are all Parisians," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said at a lighting ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Paris.

-- Hollande addressed a joint session of the French Parliament -- only the third time a president has done so since 1848 -- and said he would seek to add 5,000 positions to the country's paramilitary police force.

-- Hollande declared a state of emergency across France, which lets authorities limit people's movements and impose zones of security and protection. Hollande would like to see his country's state of emergency in place for three months, and he proposed measures that would allow France to deport suspected terrorists or strip them of their citizenship, even if they were born in the country, he said.

-- The French government announced tightened border controls, put the gendarmerie paramilitary police on heightened alert and ordered 1,500 military troops to join already increased security forces. France intends to continue airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, and the arrival of aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle will triple the country's ability to carry out those strikes, Hollande said.

Repercussions around the globe

-- Belgian officials called off a scheduled football match in Brussels on Tuesday between Belgium and Spain because of security concerns. Belgium has raised its terrorist alert level to 3 (out of a maximum of 4), the country's Interior Ministry's Crisis Center said late Monday.

-- British Prime Minister David Cameron announced a plan for $3 billion in additional funding to be spent on the country's military forces to fight terrorism. He also addressed a controversial bill that he says will ensure that British authorities have powers to follow terrorist movements by tracking and intercepting communications.

"The more we learn about what happened in Paris, the more it justifies the approach that we are taking in Britain," Cameron said.

-- London's Metropolitan Police will be increasing the number of officers on patrol at Tuesday's England vs. France soccer match at Wembley Stadium.

-- In a purported ISIS video, a fighter says the terror organization will "strike America in its own stronghold in Washington." The FBI and Department of Homeland Security say there's "no credible threat to the United States," but law enforcement officials in the U.S. capital say they're stepping up security. And CIA Director John Brennan said he would not consider the Paris attacks a "one-off event," and added, "I would anticipate this is not the only operation that (ISIS) has in the pipeline."

-- U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has asked the Obama administration to provide a classified briefing for all House members.

-- The United States and France will "bolster" their intelligence sharing, to the fullest extent of the law, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said. And Kerry vowed that ISIS will be defeated. "The United States and France are not only friends, we are family. And today, the entire world joins our family in heartbreak yet again," Kerry said.

"Don't mistake what these attacks represent. This is not a clash of civilizations. These terrorists have declared war against all civilization. ... This is an assault not just on France, but coming on the heels of brutal attacks in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere, it is an assault on our collective sense of reason and purpose, an attack on civility itself."

-- The French air force carried out bombing missions over Raqqa Sunday and Monday against strategic ISIS targets. France was already part of a U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes on ISIS, and since Friday's attacks, French officials have vowed to fight back.

-- Around the world, Obama pledged solidarity with France, Pope Francis condemned the killings, British Prime Minister David Cameron convened a meeting of the emergency response committee, Russian leader Vladimir Putin sent condolences to France, The Netherlands increased border security and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel "stands shoulder to shoulder to France."
