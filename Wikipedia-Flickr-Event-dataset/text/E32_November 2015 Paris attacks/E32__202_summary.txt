Coldplay, meanwhile, called off a live stream of a concert "out of respect for the terrible events in Paris".
Of the 129 people killed, 89 died when gunmen stormed the Bataclan concert venue where US rock band Eagles of Death Metal were performing.
"Due to the serious situation in Paris we have to postpone our gig until January," wrote Motorhead on Twitter.
U2, who had been due to perform in Paris on Saturday, instead spent the evening laying flowers near the Bataclan theatre.
