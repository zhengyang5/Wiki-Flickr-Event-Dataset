After the confusion of Friday night, more clarity is emerging about the attackers involved in the synchronised atrocities.

While police still investigate their identities, we now know that seven terrorists died in the course of the attacks.

Six of them blew themselves up â€“ the first-ever suicide bombings on French soil.

Two gunmen detonated suicide belts as police stormed the Bataclan music venue, and a third was shot by police.

Three suicide bombers also detonated their explosives outside the Stade de France stadium.

The seventh attacker blew himself up on a busy street near the concert hall, also injuring one other person.
