CLOSE Dozens of people were reported dead Friday night following several separate terror attacks in and around Paris.
The eighth was killed by security forces in the attempt to rescue the hostages at the concert hall.
Overall, at least 120 people were killed in the attacks at six sites across the city, Thibault-Lecuivre said.
SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. organization that monitors extremist websites, said jihadists were celebrating the attacks on social media.
The attacks come just 11 months after 16 were killed in twin attacks at the Paris offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery store outside the city.
