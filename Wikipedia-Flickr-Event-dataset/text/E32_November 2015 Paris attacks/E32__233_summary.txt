The raid was linked to last year's Paris attacks in which 130 people died.
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said a French policewoman was one of the officers wounded in the raid on the flat.
With the operation at that apartment over, police told the BBC they were widening their search of the area - possibly involving a second location.
Most of the suspects either died during the attacks or were killed in subsequent police raids.
Parts of Brussels were sealed off for days after the Paris massacre amid fears of a major incident.
