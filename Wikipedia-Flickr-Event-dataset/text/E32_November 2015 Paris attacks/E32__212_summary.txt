The New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, said on Sunday that the attacks in Paris represented a “game changer” for law enforcement.
“This is the new paradigm we’re going to have to deal with,” Mr. Bratton said on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” in the second of two television interviews on Sunday.
“That’s something we need to be aware of in terms of protecting our first responders,” Mr. Bratton said.
“We are going to learn from this event, reinforcing that you don’t stay outside waiting as police; you have to get in,” Mr. Bratton said.
But now we’re up against this concept of people equipped with suicide vests, so we’re going to have to train for that.
