Detectives were examining what appeared to be an explosive belt found in a litter bin in the town of Montrouge, south of the capital and not far from Chatillon.
“Maybe he had a technical problem with his explosive belt,” a police source said.
Belgium has been at the heart of investigations into the Paris attacks since French law enforcement bodies said two of the suicide bombers had lived there.
In Belgium, prosecutors said they had charged a fourth person with terrorist offences linked to the Paris attacks.
French police cordon the area after an alleged explosive belt was found in Montrouge, near Paris, a week after a series of deadly attacks in the French capital Paris, France, November 23, 2015.
