Originally reported by Bavarian public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk, a 51-year-old man from Montenegro was stopped by police on November 5.
However, he declined to speculate on any link between the arrest and the Paris assassins.
According to Bayerischer Runkfunk, Bavarian authorities had notified their French counterparts immediately after the incident because they had reason to believe he was travelling to Paris.
Officials in France say that at least 120 people were killed in Paris during a string of attacks across the city on Friday night.
On Saturday morning, French President Francois Hollande blamed the killings on "Islamic State," calling the incident an "act of war."
