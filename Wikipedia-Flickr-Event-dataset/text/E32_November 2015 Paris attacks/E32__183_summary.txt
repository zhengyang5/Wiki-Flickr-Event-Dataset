Poland has signalled it will retreat on an EU-wide quota commitment to relocate migrants across the continent, following Friday night’s attacks in Paris, which killed at least 127 people.
Konrad Szymanski, Poland’s incoming European affairs minister, said his government did not agree with Poland’s commitment to accept its share of an EU-wide relocation of migrants.
In September Poland’s outgoing centre-right government backed a European plan to share out 120,000 refugees across the 28-nation bloc.
Under the plan, the Poland was to take in 4,500 refugees.
The migrant crisis in Europe was a key issue in the Polish election campaign with PiS strongly critical of the government’s decision to accept refugees.
