Chief Volker Kluwe told NDR that authorities "had concrete intelligence that someone wanted to set off an explosive device inside the stadium."
The two tips forced officials to cancel the Netherlands-Germany match about 90 minutes before kickoff.
We did not take this decision lightly, but it was in accordance with the seriousness of the intelligence," Kluwe said of the match cancellation.
However, no explosives were found at the stadium, regional Interior Minister Boris Pistorius said at a news conference Tuesday night.
Later that same evening, two Air France flights headed from the United States to Paris were also diverted because of bomb threats, officials said.
