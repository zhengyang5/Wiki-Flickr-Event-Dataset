Hassan Nasrallah, head of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah movement, condemned the November 13 attacks in Paris during a TV address November 14, urging supporters not to retaliate against Syrian refugees after a November 12 bombing killed 44 in Lebanon (AFP Photo/)Beirut (AFP) - Hassan Nasrallah, chief of Lebanon's powerful Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, strongly condemned Saturday the Islamic State group's attacks in Paris that killed at least 129 people.
"We, Hezbollah, express our strong condemnation and denunciation of the terrorist attack by the criminals of Daesh in Paris," he said in a televised address, using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist group.
Hezbollah is a leading backer of Syria's embattled President Bashar al-Assad, and its militiamen have fought alongside regime forces in the country's civil war.
The movement has said its involvement in Syria will keep Lebanon and the region safe from jihadists, including IS.
On Saturday, Nasrallah said those who thought the attack on southern Beirut would discourage Hezbollah from acting in Syria were mistaken.
