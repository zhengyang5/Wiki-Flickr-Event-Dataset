Syrian President Bashar al-Assad suggested Saturday that French support for opposition forces in his countryâ€™s civil war led to the Islamic State-claimed attacks in Paris that killed at least 129 people.
France backs Syrian rebel groups and has been a particularly vocal opponent of Assad during the nearly five-year conflict.

But the comments are likely to infuriate officials in France, which regularly hosts meetings among Syrian opposition politicians and has called for military intervention against the Syrian president.
World powers convened Saturday in Vienna for discussions on how to end the Syrian war.
