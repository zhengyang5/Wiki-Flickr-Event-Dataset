The authorities have also stepped up security measures and border checks, says Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam.

SINGAPORE: The Republic has raised its alert level and stepped up security measures and border checks in the wake of the Paris attacks, Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.

The attacks, which left at least 120 dead, show that "no country is immune, even when there is a state of heightened security", Mr Shanmugam said in a statement issued on Saturday (Nov 14).

Such attacks aim to strike fear in the community, he said.

"We must therefore continue to build up our social resilience. This will ensure that if an incident were to occur here, we will stand together, recover quickly and emerge stronger and more united," he added.

Mr Shanmugam also urged Singaporeans to report suspicious activities or people to the authorities.

"In this difficult time, our thoughts are with the French people. We pray for their recovery and that they will emerge stronger as a community."

Speaking at the Singapore Civil Defence Force Parade and The Singapore-Global Firefighters and Paramedic Challenge on the same day, Mr Shanmugam described the attacks as a "very, very sad situation".

He said: "Several gun attacks were obviously coordinated to bring war onto the streets of cities in a completely uncivilised, dastardly way ... Essentially the approach of the terrorists is to try and disrupt normal life."
