But after the attacks on Friday in Paris, fears that Islamic terrorists might infiltrate the migrant flow have deepened across the Continent, and the talk has shifted sharply to security over compassion.
And since the attacks by militants, and the discovery of a passport of a recent Syrian migrant near the scene of a suicide bombing, the rising antimigrant sentiment seems poised to substantially shift the conversation.
Since the attacks in Paris on Friday, leaders have stepped up their criticism.
“The migrants’ problems have been overshadowed.”In Poland, already quite cool to the idea of allowing hundreds of thousands of migrants into Europe, the attacks in Paris further hardened attitudes.
The answer to the Paris attacks, said Peter N. Bouckaert, the emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, is not to shut the door on those desperately fleeing war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, including many fleeing from the Islamic State.
