President François Hollande shut France’s borders and declared a national state of emergency on Friday as dozens of people were feared dead and scores taken hostage in a series of violent terror attacks in the capital city of Paris.
Early reports suggested at least 60 people had been killed in the attacks, and an estimated 100 taken hostage in a concert.
French police officials told the AP that of 3 explosions outside the Stade de France, one was a suicide attack.
“This is a terrible test, another assault on France,” Hollande said.
President Hollande has been safely evacuated from the stadium.
