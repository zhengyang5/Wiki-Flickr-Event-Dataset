Investigators are checking if Abrini is also the "man in the hat", the third bomber in the Brussels airport attacks last month, who fled the scene.
The individual in the footage was seen beside the two suicide bombers at Brussels airport.
Prosecutors believe he entered Belgium on 3 October after being picked up in the German city of Ulm by Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam, using a rental car.
On Friday, a US couple killed in the Brussels airport attack, Justin Blake Shults and his wife Stephanie Michele Moore Shults, were buried in Nicholasville, Kentucky.
