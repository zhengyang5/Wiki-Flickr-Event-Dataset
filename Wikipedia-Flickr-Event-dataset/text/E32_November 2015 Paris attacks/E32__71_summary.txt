To avoid a panic, the match continued as successive explosions boomed outside and security officials hustled French president Hollande from the stands.
According to early reports, several of the explosions were the results of suicide bombers — a dubious first in French history.
“As I speak, terrorist attacks of an unprecedented scale are taking place in the Paris region,” French president Francois Hollande declared in a midnight address.
Two of the targets Friday, Le Carillon and Le Bataclan are in the same general neighbourhood as the Charlie Hebdo offices.
French authorities have been particularly concerned about the threat from domestic Islamic radicals who have obtained terrorist training in Syria.
