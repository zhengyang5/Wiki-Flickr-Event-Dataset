Less than a day after the horrific attacks in Paris, Daesh (al-dowla al-islaamiyya fii-il-i'raaq wa-ash-shaam, a.k.a.
ISIS/ISIL) took the Al-Hayat propaganda machine to the Darknet and published a new video celebrating the Paris attacks.
The new website is a collection of propaganda by Al-Hayat Media Center, the media division of Daesh.
The website also contains translations from the recent statement issued by Daesh claiming credit for the Paris attacks in English, Turkish, and Russian.
The new propaganda hub was discovered by researcher Scot Terban, who shared his findings with Salted Hash.
