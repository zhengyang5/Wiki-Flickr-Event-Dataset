Disneyland Paris will remain closed today in the wake of the terrorist attack that killed over 120 people and wounded over 200 in Paris on Nov. 13.

Located in Marne-la-Vallee, a Eastern suburb near Paris, Disneyland Paris claimed it was closing for security reasons and to show some solidarity.

“Considering the gravity of the events that occurred in France and by solidarity for the French government and the victims of these hideous attacks, Disneyland Paris has decided to not open on November 14,” said the park in an official statement. “Our prayers go out to all those who were hurt by these horrific events.” Disneyland Paris will reimburse all the tickets purchased.

Reacting to the unprecedented attacks, Francois Hollande declared last night that the country had been placed under a state of emergency and passed several measures, including the shutting down of borders and the mobilization of all police and military forces on the ground to track down terrorists all across France. So far eight attackers are dead — seven of them blew themselves up — and police say there could be more terrorists on the run and more attacks in the days to come.

Schools and museums are also closed today.
