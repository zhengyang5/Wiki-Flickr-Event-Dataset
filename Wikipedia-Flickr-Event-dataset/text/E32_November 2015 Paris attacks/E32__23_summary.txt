A week after the Paris attacks, an emergency meeting in Brussels of EU interior ministers said all EU citizens entering or leaving the free-travel area, known as Schengen, should undergo “systematic” screening against pan-European databases.
Under current Schengen rules, this is impossible, with EU citizens subject to “minimum” identification procedures, which are generally cursory and perfunctory.
Finalising the new borders regime could take months, however, and is likely to run into legislative infighting in Brussels.
Previous attempts to tighten the borders regime, notably after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in January, petered out.
They demanded a deal with the European parliament within a month.
