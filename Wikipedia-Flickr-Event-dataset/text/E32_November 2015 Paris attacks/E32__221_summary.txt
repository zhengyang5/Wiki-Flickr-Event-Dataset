The World Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, the Fifth Khalifa (Caliph), His Holiness, Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad has condemned last night’s terrorist attacks in Paris.
Speaking from London, His Holiness, Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad has said:“On behalf of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community worldwide, I express my heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the French nation, its people and government following the heinous terrorist attacks that have taken place in Paris.
I would also like to reiterate that all forms of terrorism and extremism are completely against the true teachings of Islam.
