As a series of bloody shootings unfolds across Paris tonight, Nov. 13, leaving dozens of confirmed deaths, support for the city has already begun with the hashtag #portesouvertes.
The hashtag is being used to offer shelter in Paris to anyone in the city who is afraid to attempt returning home or taking public transportation.
