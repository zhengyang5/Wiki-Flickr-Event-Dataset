The Turkish authorities warned their French counterparts twice in the past year about one of the attackers, Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, a 29-year-old French citizen who was known by the authorities as someone who had radical Islamist beliefs, an official said on Monday.

The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, in line with government protocol, said the government never heard back from France and only received an “information request” about Mr. Mostefaï after the Paris attacks.

“On Oct. 10, 2014, Turkey received an information request regarding four terror suspects from the French authorities,” the official said. “During the official investigation, the Turkish authorities identified a fifth individual, Omar Ismail Mostefai, and notified their French counterparts twice — in December 2014 and June 2015.”

European intelligence officials believe that Mr. Mostefaï traveled to Turkey in 2012, and probably then slipped into Syria.

The Turkish official disputed that account, saying Mr. Mostefaï entered Turkey in 2013 and that there was no record of him leaving the country.

Pointing to the lack of communication, the Turkish official said the case of Mr. Mostefaï reflected the importance of sharing intelligence in fighting terrorism.
