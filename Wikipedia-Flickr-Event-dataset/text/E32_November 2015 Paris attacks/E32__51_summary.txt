Three hundred people were hospitalized, according to Paris medical authorities, including 80 people in life-threatening condition and 177 in somewhat critical condition.
"The U.S. government is working closely with French authorities to identify American victims," said Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner.
AFP said that three more attackers were dead outside the Stade de France soccer stadium and one on a street in eastern Paris.
In the wake of the attacks, Hollande said he was imposing border checks and declaring a state of emergency.
The FBI is actively trying to help French authorities, but as of now, U.S. authorities do not know who is responsible.
