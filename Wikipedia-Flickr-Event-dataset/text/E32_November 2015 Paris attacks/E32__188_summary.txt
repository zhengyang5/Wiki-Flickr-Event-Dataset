SOFREP sources reported to us weeks ago that the French National Police were meeting with the German BKA federal police and BND federal intelligence service to discuss an imminent pre-planned terrorist attack in Paris.
Industrial targets were already being probed by suspected terrorists in France, and a bomb which failed to detonate was found in one facility.
The explosives employed were those stolen in a little-publicized theft from a French military armory months prior.
The French and German federal police and intelligence services strongly believed at that time that terrorists were casing soft targets inside Paris and that it was, “A matter of when, not if.” The only point of contention within the French security services was whether or not the target would be soft (civilian) or hard (military, government, industrial) in nature.
