Police in France have been given huge new powers including the ability to put people under house arrest without trial and to block websites.
France's parliament has extended the country's state of emergency for three months, allowing authorities to get access to huge powers that date back to 1955.
The state of emergency was declared on Saturday, just after attacks that left 129 people dead.
Rights groups have worried that the decision could become permanent, allowing for the extension of authorities' powers into normal life.
