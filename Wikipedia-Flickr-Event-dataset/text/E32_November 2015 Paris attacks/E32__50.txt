A massive series of terror attacks in and around Paris left over 120 people dead across six sites Friday, including at least eight attackers with unknown motivations.

At least 100 people were killed at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris' 11th arrondissement, where scores of hostages had been held. Police in Paris told NBC News that several people had also been shot at a restaurant in the nearby 10th arrondissement in Paris.

At the concert hall, the attackers opened fire on a crowd waiting to hear American rock band Eagles of Death Metal perform.

Just to the north, loud explosions reverberated around the national stadium, Stade de France, packed with some 80,000 fans watching France beat Germany in a soccer exhibition match.

The city's police chief, Michel Cadot, said the assailants wore explosive belts, which they detonated.

The Paris prosecutor Francois Molins' office said that eight attackers were dead, seven of them via suicide bombing. The eighth attacker was killed by security forces when they raided the the Bataclan.

A police union official, Gregory Goupil, said the bombings killed at least three people â€” near two of the entrances to the stadium and a McDonald's. The stadium was the first site targeted.

From there, the terror spread across the city. There were 14 people dead on one street, five on another, Molins said.

"The terrorists, the assassins, sprayed the outsides of several cafes with machine guns and went inside," Cadot, the police chief, said. "So there were victims in terrible and atrocious states in numerous places."
