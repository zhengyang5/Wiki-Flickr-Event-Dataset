PhotoThe Bataclan, the storied, 150-year-old Paris music hall where four men with AK-47 assault rifles killed 89 people on Friday, was until recently owned by a Jewish family.
There is some speculation that the terrorists who attacked the Bataclan during a concert by the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal targeted the theater for this reason.
It was sold several months ago, according to a family member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fears for the family’s safety.
The theater, at 50 Boulevard Voltaire, has long been a center of the city’s rock ’n’ roll and counterculture scene.
“It is one of the icons of Paris,” the family member said.
