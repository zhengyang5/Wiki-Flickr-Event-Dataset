In the wake of the Paris attacks, Waleed talks about what ISIL has told us that they want - a world divided against itself.
WALEED Aly has unleashed on Australia’s politicians and Muslim leaders who have preached “hate” in the wake of the Paris attacks saying their actions actually help Islamic State rather than defeat them.
“ISIL don’t want you to know they would quickly be crushed if they ever faced a proper Army on a battlefield.
Bravo to Waleed Aly for dealing with ISIL in the way most needed right now.
“Society tearing itself apart is actually one of the intended outcomes of terrorist attacks done by ISIS; this is what they want.
