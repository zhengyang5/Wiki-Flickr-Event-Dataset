Hasna Ait Boulahcen, the woman labelled "Europe's first woman suicide bomber" did not blow herself up during a police raid on an apartment building in Saint-Denis, new reports have claimed.
Boulahcen is reported to have shouted: “Help me, help me, I am on fire,” prior to the explosion.
After the explosion of the suicide bomb, sporadic gunfire could be heard from within the flat.
Officers eventually arrested three men from inside the building and another man and woman found outside.
Authorities believe they are part of a terror cell set to carry out a second attack, reportedly targeting Charles de Gaulle airport and Paris' financial district La Defense.
