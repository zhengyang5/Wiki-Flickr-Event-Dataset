Three Bombers Attacked the Stadium

Three attackers detonated suicide vests outside the Stade de France, where a soccer match between France and Germany was being played.

Gate D Bomber

The first attacker detonated his explosives at 9:20 p.m. on Rue Rimet, near Gate D of the stadium. One other person was killed.

The attacker was carrying a passport for a 25-year-old named Ahmad al-Mohammad from Idlib, Syria. The passport had been used by a man posing as a migrant who passed through the Greek island of Leros on Oct. 3 and Presevo, Serbia, on Oct. 7. The French authorities believe that the passport may have been stolen, and the French police asked the public on Tuesday for help in identifying the man, using a photo from an identity document that was issued in Greece.

Gate H Bomber

The unidentified second attacker at the stadium detonated his explosives at 9:30 p.m. on Rue Rimet, near Gate H of the stadium. No one else was reported killed. Officials reported on Friday that fingerprints matching the bomber were taken at a check for migrants in Greece on Oct. 3. Fingerprints for the Gate D bomber were taken during the same check. On Nov. 22, the French National Police posted on Twitter a picture without a name, and asked anyone who had information on the person to contact the authorities.

Bilal Hadfi, 20

The third attacker, identified as Bilal Hadfi, a 20-year-old French citizen living in Belgium, detonated his explosives at 9:53 p.m. on Rue de la Cokerie, just outside of a McDonaldâ€™s restaurant about 300 meters from the stadium. No one else was reported killed.
