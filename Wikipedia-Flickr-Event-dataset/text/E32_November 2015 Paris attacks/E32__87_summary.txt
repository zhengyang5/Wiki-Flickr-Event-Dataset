"But the killing of hostages at the theater was a slaughter," said one of the U.S. sources.
Islamic State said in a statement that "youth who divorced from the world and went to their enemy" had targeted "the hearts of the Crusaders" and unleashed "horror in the middle of their land."
French officials, including Hollande, have publicly blamed the attacks on Islamic State.
But the U.S. sources said the multiple sites and soft, crowded targets in the attacks are indicative of Al Qaeda rather than Islamic State.
They stressed that authorities still are trying to pin down which organization was behind the attacks.
