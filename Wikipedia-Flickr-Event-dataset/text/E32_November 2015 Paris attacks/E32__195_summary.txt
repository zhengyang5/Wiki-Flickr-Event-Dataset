Christian Hartmann/ReutersAs attacks continue in France's capital, people are taking to Twitter to figure out what's going on with transportation in Paris.
Despite reports to the contrary, Uber's service has not been suspended in Paris, a rep tells us, but the status of Uber's service in Paris isn't known right now.
Parisian Uber users were alerted with an "Emergency Situation" message when they opened the app.
There are reports that the Paris Metro is closed as well, but there are some Paris taxis that are taking people home for free.
This tweet translates to: "According [to my] friend in [a] taxi: Cabs [are] off the counters in Paris and bring[ing] people home."
