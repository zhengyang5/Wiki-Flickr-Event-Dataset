Mohamed Abdeslam, the brother of two suspects accused of taking part in the Paris attacks, has insisted he is not "in the slightest way" connected to the killings and said he has no idea of the whereabouts of his brother Salah, who is currently the focus of an international manhunt.
His brother Brahim died on Friday after blowing himself up outside a caf√© in Paris' 11th arrodissement, wounding one person in the process.
"My brother Salah still has not been heard from, perhaps he just isn't daring to show himself to the authorities," he said.
Mohamed also claimed that he had no idea that Brahim was even in Paris when he blew himself up.
Police continue to hunt for Salah Abdeslam, and have branded him 'dangerous' and warned the public not to approach him.
