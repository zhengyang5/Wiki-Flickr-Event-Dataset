Muslim leaders around the world have condemned the Paris attacks that left 127 people dead and as many as 80 people fighting for their lives in critical conditions.
Many of the denunciations came before Isis released a statement claiming responsibility for the attacks that have devastated the French capital and left many reeling.
Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani condemned the attacks, calling them a “crime against humanity” and said he would postpone his plan to visit France as part of a wider European trip this weekend.
The foreign minister for Qatar, Khaled al-Attiyah, labelled the atrocities “heinous”.
There is nothing Islamic about such people and their actions are evil, and outside the boundaries set by our faith.”
