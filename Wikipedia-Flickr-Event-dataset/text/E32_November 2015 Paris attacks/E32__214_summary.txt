The attacks came as the Philippines is preparing for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Summit this week.
US President Barack Obama is set to join the leaders of China, Japan, Australia, Canada and 15 others during the annual APEC summit on Nov. 18-19.
Aquino said the Philippine National Police (PNP) was placed on alert and security forces were assessing the situation, including the continuing evaluation of security procedures.
Wilben Mayor said the intelligence units have not monitored any specific threat to the APEC Summit but is still up on its toes for developments.
Mayor added that all possible security scenarios – including possible terror attacks – have already been considered into the framing of the APEC security plan.
