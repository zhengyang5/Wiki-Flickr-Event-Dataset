U2 lead singer Bono has said the Paris massacres, especially the attack on the music concert, was Islamic State’s first “direct hit against music”.
Bono said the bombs and bullets at the Eagles of Death Metal concert showed the attackers don’t like music.
The U2 star added: “When you think about it, the majority of victims from last night’s attacks were music fans.
“So this really is the first direct hit on music we’ve had on this so-called war on terror.
Meanwhile Ulster’s European Rugby Champions Cup clash with French side Oyonnax was cancelled on Saturday due to the killings in Paris.
