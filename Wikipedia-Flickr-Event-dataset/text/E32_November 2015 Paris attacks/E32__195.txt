As attacks continue in France's capital, people are taking to Twitter to figure out what's going on with transportation in Paris.

Despite reports to the contrary, Uber's service has not been suspended in Paris, a rep tells us, but the status of Uber's service in Paris isn't known right now. Parisian Uber users were alerted with an "Emergency Situation" message when they opened the app. Below is the translated message:

Attacks are underway in Paris and its surroundings. The Prefecture of Police of Paris has asked that you stay safely inside. Do not travel unless absolutely necessary. Uber France.

There are reports that the Paris Metro is closed as well, but there are some Paris taxis that are taking people home for free.

This tweet translates to: "According [to my] friend in [a] taxi: Cabs [are] off the counters in Paris and bring[ing] people home."

So far, recent reports say that at least 120 people have been killed and many others injured. Parisians are using the hashtag #PorteOuverte, which means "open door," to find shelter.
