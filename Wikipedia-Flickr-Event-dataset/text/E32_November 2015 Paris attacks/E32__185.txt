During a conversation with Poles on a major social networking site on Friday evening, Beata Szydło said that the time has come to consider whether EU decisions on refugees are the right ones, and if they are headed in the right direction.

“We will convince EU partners that these decisions should be different,” Prime Minister Szydło said.

Szydło stressed that one of the major topics of the online conversation on Friday was the issue of refugees in the European Union.

"From the very beginning of our government, we are being very active [in this area],” PM Szydło said.

The previous Polish government led by former Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz had vouched to take one some 7,000 refugees as part of an EU relocation plan.

Since taking office, the Law and Justice (PiS) government has voiced its opinion that the agreement should be reviewed.

Following the terrorist attacks in Paris, a number of ministers in the government have hinted that Poland could make a U-turn on the decision by the former government.

In Friday's conversation, Beata Szydło explained that both Polish Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz, and Interior Minister Mariusz Błaszczak have conducted high-level talks in Brussels on the future of the EU's security and border control.

On Saturday, the Polish Defence Ministry tweeted that Minister Macierewicz has offered Poland's support to France “in combating the terrorist threat”. (rg/di)
