Yasser Louati, a member of the Collective Against Islamaphobia in France, says the Muslim community is disgusted by Friday's attacks.

He told BBC Radio 5live Muslims now live in fear of a backlash.

"The reports we are receiving from the ground is that now people are being attacked, mosques are being attacked, death threats are being written all over social media.

"Unfortunately less than a year ago when the attacks were carried out against the newspaper Charlie Hebdo and the Jewish supermarket, we provided the wrong answers.

"We added more division to division and we have put Muslims as if they were somehow responsible or somehow connected. I fear for the Muslim community right now. People are calling us worried whether they should send their children to school or not on Monday."
