The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said Abaaoud had played a “decisive role” in the Paris attacks and was suspected of involvement in four of the six terror plots that French intelligence services had foiled so far in 2015.
The French draft resolution does not provide any legal basis for military action and does not invoke chapter seven of the UN charter authorising use of force.
But French diplomats said it would provide important international political support to the anti-Isis campaign that has been ramped up since the attacks in Paris on Friday.
France’s bid came after Russia submitted a revised text of a separate draft resolution that calls for fighting Isis with Syria’s consent.
The text “unequivocally condemns in the strongest terms the horrifying terrorist attacks” by the Islamic State group in Paris and Beirut, and also mentions violence in Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt during 2015.
