PARIS—Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the possible ringleader of last week’s terrorist attacks, has been identified as among those killed in a police raid north of Paris Nov. 18, the Paris prosecutor said.
French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve said they did not know Abaaoud was in Europe until Nov. 16, after the Paris attacks were carried out.
Aitboulahcen died Wednesday as police closed in on an apartment in suburban Saint-Denis, along with Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the man suspected of orchestrating the Nov. 13 attacks across Paris that killed 129 people.
Abaaoud, the son of a Moroccan-born shopkeeper in Brussels, played “an instrumental role in the attacks” in Paris, he said.
French authorities have said most of the Friday attackers — five have been identified so far — were unknown to them.
