(Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande said on Saturday the attacks in Paris that killed 127 people were “an act of war” organized from abroad by Islamic State with internal help.
French President Francois Hollande speaks at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, the day after a series of deadly attacks in the French capital, November 14, 2015.
The attacks at a stadium, concert hall and cafes and restaurants in northern and eastern Paris were “an act of war committed by Daesh that was prepared, organized and planned from outside (of France)” with help from inside France, Hollande said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
Islamic State released an undated video on Saturday urging Muslims to attack France.
Some witnesses in the hall said they heard the gunmen shout Islamic chants and slogans condemning France’s role in Syria.
