"Serious plans for explosions" cancel Netherlands-Germany soccer game, regional police chief tells German media

Stadium was evacuated and German national team "has been escorted to a safe place," according to team's Twitter account

(CNN) "Serious plans for explosions" forced the evacuation of a stadium in Hannover, Germany, on Tuesday night before a Netherlands-Germany soccer match, the police chief for Germany's Lower Saxony region told Germany's public broadcaster NDR.

Chief Volker Kluwe told NDR that authorities "had concrete intelligence that someone wanted to set off an explosive device inside the stadium." The two tips forced officials to cancel the Netherlands-Germany match about 90 minutes before kickoff.

"We do take this intelligence seriously. That is why we proceeded with this protocol. We did not take this decision lightly, but it was in accordance with the seriousness of the intelligence," Kluwe said of the match cancellation. However, no explosives were found at the stadium, regional Interior Minister Boris Pistorius said at a news conference Tuesday night.

Later that same evening, two Air France flights headed from the United States to Paris were also diverted because of bomb threats, officials said. Both flights landed safely.
