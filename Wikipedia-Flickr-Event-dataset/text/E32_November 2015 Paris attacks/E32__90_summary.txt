ISIS has issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attacks in Paris, calling the city a capital of "crusaders" as well as "prostitution and vice."
The statement, below, is not surprising: ISIS often claims credit for terror attacks, whether or not it was actually responsible.
And while there is strong reason to suspect ISIS responsibility for the Paris attacks that killed more than 120, including the fact that French President Fran√ßois Hollande stated as much, the ISIS statement is still a bit odd.
Terror groups, when they claim credit for attacks, will sometimes include details of the planning or execution that establish the group was indeed responsible.
It also includes no biographical information on the attackers, even a name or photo, though terror groups will often lionize its attackers as "martyrs" in such statements.
