Cafe That Was Hit By Paris Terrorism Attack ReopensEnlarge this image toggle caption Charles Platiau /Reuters/Landov Charles Platiau /Reuters/LandovThree weeks after extremist gunmen shot at customers on its terrace, the Bonne Bière cafe reopened for business Friday, serving coffee and pastries to patrons who sat on the sidewalk behind memorials to the attack's victims.
Signs of the attack include a banner over its awning that reads "Je Suis En Terrasse" — I'm on the terrace — a defiant message that spread in the days after the Nov. 13 attack.
And instead of advertising the day's specials, the cafe's chalkboard contains a message of support for those who lost loved ones in the attack.
From Paris, NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports:"Five people died after being raked by bullets as they sat on the terrace of Cafe la Bonne Biere on a mild November night.
One woman said Paris has a wound that will never heal, but she said life must go on."
