Germany’s acting FA president, Reinhard Rauball, has praised France’s players for an “outstanding gesture of camaraderie” after they refused to leave the Stade de France on Friday night in a show of solidarity with their opponents.
Both sets of players spent much of the night on mattresses in the stadium after Germany were advised not to return to their team hotel following the terrorist attacks across Paris.
“The French said that they were staying as long as Germany had to stay,” said Rauball.
Players and staff then flew back to Frankfurt on Saturday morning.
We all looked forward to playing in the Stade de France, to have a great night of football, which ended up turning into a nightmare.
