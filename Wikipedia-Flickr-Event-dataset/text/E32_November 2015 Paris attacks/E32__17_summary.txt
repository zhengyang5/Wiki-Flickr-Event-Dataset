The horrific terrorist attacks in Paris last Friday have focused attention on Europe’s open border policy.
The ease with which terrorists known to the police moved within the EU’s internal borders – and entered the EU’s external borders into Europe – has alarmed citizens.
European Commission officials have pointed out Schengen rules already permit member states to reintroduce border checks in emergency situations, including terrorist attacks.
The main focus of discussion is likely to be on improving surveillance at the EU’s external borders, both of non-EU nationals (those from “third” countries) and EU citizens re-entering the bloc.
In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, a review of Schengen may be the next big policy agenda for the EU.
