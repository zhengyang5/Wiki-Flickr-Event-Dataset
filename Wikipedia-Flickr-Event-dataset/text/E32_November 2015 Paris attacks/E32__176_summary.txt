Marine Le Pen, the controversial leader of France's far-right National Front, is scoffing at Canada's plan to welcome 25,000 Syrian refugees with open arms, calling it "madness."
Le Pen and her party appear to have received a boost by voter concerns about security after the attacks in Paris on Nov. 13.
But he says he refuses to think most French people are like Le Pen.
"The influx of migrants must be stopped," Le Pen told the fifth estate.
In the refugee camps, Le Pen's campaign of fear is unsettling those who have made it this far.
