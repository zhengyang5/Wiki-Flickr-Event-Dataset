Turkey warned France about the threat posed by suspected Paris killer Omar Ismail Mostefai at least twice before the Friday night attacks, a Turkish official told the Guardian.
French authorities did not respond with an information request regarding Mostefai until after the coordinated attacks that killed at least 129 people.
Paris was thrust into turmoil and confusion Friday evening just after 9 p.m. when armed teams drove by cafes and opened fire.
Near the Stade de France, where the French national soccer team was playing Germany, three explosions occurred.
Later, gunmen entered a concert at the Bataclan, where an American band was playing, and began slaughtering the crowd.
