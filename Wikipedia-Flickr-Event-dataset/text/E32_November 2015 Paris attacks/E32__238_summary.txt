Paris terror attack suspect Salah Abdeslam was captured alive Friday, a Belgian counter-terrorism source said.
ET]Belgian police conducted a raid Friday in Brussels that ended with two suspects in custody -- one of whom may be wanted Paris terror attack suspect Salah Abdeslam, a senior counter-terrorism official said.
Belkaid is believed to have helped Paris suspect Salah Abdeslam travel prior to the attacks and transferred money to a female cousin of Paris ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud following the attack, the Belgian senior counter-terrorism official told CNN in January.
Authorities believe the 26-year-old Abdeslam was using the apartment as a hideout following the November 13 Paris attacks that left at least 130 people dead, according to the Belgian counter-terrorism official.
Salah Abdeslam is wanted after allegedly taking part in last fall's Paris terror attacks.
