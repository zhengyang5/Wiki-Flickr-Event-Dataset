U2 lead singer Bono has said the Paris massacres, especially the attack on the music concert, was Islamic State’s first “direct hit against music”.

Bono said the bombs and bullets at the Eagles of Death Metal concert showed the attackers don’t like music.



“Our first thoughts at this point are with the Eagles of Death Metal fans,” Bono told the Dave Fanning Show on Irish radio 2FM on Saturday.

The U2 star added: “When you think about it, the majority of victims from last night’s attacks were music fans.

“So this really is the first direct hit on music we’ve had on this so-called war on terror.

“We know that they don’t like music … and this and the cold-blooded aspect of last night’s attacks are what are really upsetting because it means it could have been any of us.

Meanwhile Ulster’s European Rugby Champions Cup clash with French side Oyonnax was cancelled on Saturday due to the killings in Paris.

Ulster’s manager Bryn Cunningham said he fully backed the European Professional Club Rugby’s decision to cancel Saturday’s game.

“We fully support the EPRC in this decision – a difficult one and that’s why it took a number of hours on Saturday morning to make it.

“However, rugby is fairly insignificant in all of this. Our thoughts, prayers and sympathies go out to the French public.”
