Gunshot woundsThe majority of those wounded in Paris were victims of gunfire, as the attackers fired Kalashnikov automatic rifles methodically into the crowds.
Blast injuriesIn Paris, those who were close to one of the suicide bomb explosions may face different types of trauma.
"Blast injuries typically are associated with concussions, or trauma to the ears, lungs, chest, and occasionally the abdominal area," Stanton said.
When the victims of the Paris attacks were treated in emergency medicine settings immediately after the attacks, Stanton said medical experts likely went through a series of body checks.
But a large percentage, possibly up to 30 percent, will continue to have symptoms, Berkowitz said.
