With over 127 dead in Paris attacks, what has caught the eye of investigators is the similarity to the 2008 Mumbai terror attack.Speaking to NDTV, former Mumbai Police Commissioner D Sivanandan, who also headed Maharashtra's Intelligence department during the 26/11 Mumbai attacks said, "In cities like Paris, New York, Mumbai, Tokyo, the major problem is the exploding population, anonymity and the cities being international in character.
"Such terror attacks are always planned at places with high footfall which are soft targets.
This kind of attack was first seen in Mumbai and today it has been improvised in Paris.
"Hence, within hours of the terror strike in Paris, a high alert was declared in Mumbai.
Immediately after the Paris attack, we have taken necessary steps in Mumbai.
