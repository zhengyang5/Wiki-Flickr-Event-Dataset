A railway station under the headquarters of the European Union’s executive was sealed off early Saturday and all traffic on the Brussels metro system was stopped.
A senior European counterterrorism official said on Saturday that Mr. Abdeslam was believed to be heavily armed with weapons and explosives, and might be seeking to regroup with confederates in Belgium.
“He may be on his last mission,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments.
Mr. Abdeslam is now the target of an intensive manhunt and he has managed to avoid arrest.
He arrived in Turkey from Amsterdam on Nov. 14 — the day after the Paris attacks.
