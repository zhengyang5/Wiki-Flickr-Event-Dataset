Heavily armed New York City police officers with Operation Hercules stand guard across the street from the French consulate on New York's Fifth Ave., Friday, Nov. 13, 2015. Police in New York say they've deployed extra units to crowded areas of the city "out of an abundance of caution" in the wake of the attacks in Paris, France. A New York Police Department statement released Friday stressed police have "no indication that the attack has any nexus to New York City."(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)
