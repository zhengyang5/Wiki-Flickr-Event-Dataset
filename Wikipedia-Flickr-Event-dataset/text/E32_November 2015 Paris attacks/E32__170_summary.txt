PARIS (Reuters) - France’s government published a guide on Friday on how to survive a terrorist attack, coupled with a warning from the prime minister that people must learn to live with the risk.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls gestures as he speaks during the questions to the government session at the National Assembly in Paris, France, November 25, 2015.
“There’s a lasting threat we are going to have to learn to live with,” French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told BFM TV.
Cutting off phone ringers and vibration-alerts on mobile phones is a key recommendation for people in hiding, to avoid alerting attackers.
There, one trapped employee hid for hours below a washbasin used by the attackers and even managed to send text messages to police.
