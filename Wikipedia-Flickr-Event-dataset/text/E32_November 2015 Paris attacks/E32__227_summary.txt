Bomb threat leads to cancellation of Germany-Netherlands 'freedom' football friendlyUpdatedEA friendly football match between host Germany and The Netherlands in Hannover was called off less than two hours before its start over fears of a bomb attack, German police said.
The match, which had been hailed as a "symbol of freedom" after the Paris attacks, was called off and thousands of fans were evacuated, without signs of panic, from the 49,000-capacity arena.
Two Dutch government ministers attending the match — defence minister Jeanine Hennes and health and sport minister Edith Schippers — were returning home.
The victims of the Paris attacks were set to be honoured by candlelight in what has been described as "a friendly in the true sense of the word".
Turkish football fans regularly shout nationalist slogans at matches and it was not immediately clear if the behaviour was more aimed against historic rivals Greece than condoning the Paris attacks in any way.
