About 100 Turkish rockets pounded a group of Kurdish fighters allied with a US-backed militia in northern Syria on Friday as Ankara's attacks against Syrian Kurds continue to intensify.

Ahmad Araj - a political representative for the Kurdish fighters allied to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia - said fighters were now under attack both from ISIL and Turkey.
Ankara's intervention, therefore, also aims to prevent Kurdish forces from gaining more ground in Syria.
