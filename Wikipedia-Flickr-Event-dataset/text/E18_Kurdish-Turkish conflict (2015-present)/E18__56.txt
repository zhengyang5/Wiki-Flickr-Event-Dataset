Security forces have intensified counterterrorism operations in recent months after the PKK terrorist group violated a truce deal in July 2015. Since then, more than 8,000 PKK members have been killed and hundreds more were injured. The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization in Turkey, the European Union and the United States, has been conducting armed violence in the southeastern part of Turkey since 1984. More than 40,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the three-decade conflict.
