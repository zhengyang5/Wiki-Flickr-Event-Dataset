President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan joined Wednesday other Turkish leaders and officials criticizing U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on arming the YPG/PYD in northern Syria in order to defeat Daish.
Touching upon Clinton's comments, "I find Mrs. Clinton's remarks on arming the YPG/PYD very unfortunate, I consider it political inexperience," Erdoğan said.
The YPG/PYD group, which Clinton said was "U.S.'s best partner in Syria", controls large swathes of territory in northern Syria along the border with Turkey, which considers it as a grave national security threat.
Turkey has repeatedly said that arming the PKK/PYD is a source of concern, as the terrorist group poses a threat to Turkey.
Erdoğan also said that Turkey will not allow a "terror corridor" to be formed just south of its borders, and will take necessary precautions to prevent it.
