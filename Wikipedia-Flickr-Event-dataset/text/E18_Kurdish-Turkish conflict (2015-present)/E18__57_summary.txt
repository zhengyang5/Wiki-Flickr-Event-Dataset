DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Three Turkish soldiers and 13 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants were killed on Monday during clashes in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast, security sources said.
Turkish soldiers were on an operation in the Daglica district of Hakkari province, which borders Iraq, when clashes broke out, leaving three of the soldiers and four militants dead, the sources said.
Nine more PKK militants were killed and four were severely wounded in an operation in the Hisar region of Hakkari, security sources said.
The Turkish military said earlier this month that a total of 463 militants had been killed in military operations in the Hakkari province.
In security operations over the past week, 28 PKK militants were “neutralized”, the Interior Ministry said on Monday.
