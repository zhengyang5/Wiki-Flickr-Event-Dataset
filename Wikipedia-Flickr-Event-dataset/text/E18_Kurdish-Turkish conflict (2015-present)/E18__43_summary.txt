What does Erdoğan have to do with ‘Zoroastrians’?
On May 28, Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan spoke to a crowd in southeastern Diyarbakır, the pivotal Kurdish city.
On June 8, zealously pro-Erdoğan daily Akşam came out with a huge headline: “Zoroastrians!
Yet it is not only wrong but also absurd to depict PKK militants as actual “Zoroastrians.” It is also offensive to real Zoroastrians, who now make up tiny minorities in Iraq and Iran.
Nothing good can come out of a policy that does nothing but deepen such dangerous dynamics.
