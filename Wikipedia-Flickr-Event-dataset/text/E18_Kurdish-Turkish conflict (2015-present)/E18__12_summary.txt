Two Turkish police officers have been found dead, shot in the head, in an attack close to the Syrian border claimed by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
The statement goes on to name the policemen killed and said "their weapons/ID documents were seized by an Apoc√Æ team".
Turkish authorities have said they believe the suicide bomber responsible for the attack was a young man recently lured into joining Isil.
On Wednesday, a Turkish official said DNA testing had confirmed that a 20-year-old Turkish man carried out the suicide bombing.
Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish prime minister, on Tuesday rejected accusations that Turkey had tacitly supported Isil and had unwittingly opened the door to the bombing.
