DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkish tanks on Tuesday pounded Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party (PKK) targets in Cizre, a southeastern town at the heart of a military operation that the army said has killed 127 Kurdish militants in a week.
In the town of Sirnak further east, a police officer was killed after militants attacked his armed vehicle, they said.
Security forces launched a new offensive in the mainly Kurdish region last week after President Tayyip Erdogan pledged to root out militants.
Images on state media from Sur have shown Turkish troops patrolling rubble-strewn streets among buildings riddled with bullet holes.
On Tuesday, a Turkish soldier was killed in Bitlis, the army said, during an operation that killed two PKK militants.
