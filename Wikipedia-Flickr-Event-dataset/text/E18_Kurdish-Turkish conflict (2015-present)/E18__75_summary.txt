Germany: Turkey righteous in fight against PKK, but solution is on political groundEmine Kart - ANKARAGerman Ambassador to Turkey Martin Erdmann has voiced Berlin’s unconditional support to Ankara’s ongoing fight against the outlawed Kurdistan workers’ Party (PKK), while underlining that “a final and permanent solution” to the Kurdish issue could only be found on political grounds.“Fighting against the PKK and defending itself against the PKK is Turkey’s most natural right.
The Turkish government’s decision to impose visa requirements for Syrians coming from third countries was the right decision.
We would also welcome Turkey’s imposition of visa requirements for some Africa countries.
But nobody wants to lay this whole problem on the shoulders of Turkey.
Full alignment of our visa policy with the EU vis-à-vis third countries is an obligation we must fulfill following Turkey’s full membership to the EU.
