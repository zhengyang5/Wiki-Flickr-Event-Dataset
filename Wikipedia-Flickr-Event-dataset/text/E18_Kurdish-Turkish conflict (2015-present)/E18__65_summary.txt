Ion Todescu Does Erdogan Intend to Eliminate the Kurds in Turkey?
December seems to have been the worst month of 2015 for the Kurdish minority in Turkey.
The HRW estimates the number of killed civilians at more than 100.
President Erdogan reiterated that Turkey will continue to fight those he called ‘sympathizers of Kurdistan Workers’ Party’ until they are totally eliminated.
Though he benefits from cooperation and oil trade with the Iraqi Kurds, Erdogan seeks to avoid the rise of pro-Kurdish political parties in Turkey.
