The airstrikes came a day after Turkey bombed Isis targets across the border in Syria, the first major show of military force against the group.
PKK declared the ceasefire with Turkey effectively over after Turkish forces launched airstrikes on the group’s camps in northern Iraq.
“The ceasefire has been unilaterally ended by the Turkish state and the Turkish military.
The truce has no meaning any more after these intense airstrikes by the occupant Turkish army,” the PKK said on its website.
Cvernight on Friday, Turkish forces went on to hit PKK targets in the Qandil mountains of northern Iraq, its command centre, the Prime Minister’s office said.
