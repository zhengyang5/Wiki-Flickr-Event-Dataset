"We call for an immediate ceasefire in the southeast and strongly condemn all kinds of terrorism," Mogherini told a joint press conference with Turkish ministers in Ankara.
We have an imminent interest on that because it can affect the security in the region, and in the broader sense, the EU," added European Union Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn.
After a more than two-year ceasefire, fighting resumed last summer between Turkish security forces and the PKK, dashing hopes of ending a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people since 1984.
But Turkey's EU Affairs Minister Volkan Bozkir vowed no let-up in the campaign against the PKK, which has since staged a string of attacks against security forces.
"As a sovereign state, Turkey will continue its struggle against all terrorist organisations, including the PKK, which are threatening its national security," he said.
