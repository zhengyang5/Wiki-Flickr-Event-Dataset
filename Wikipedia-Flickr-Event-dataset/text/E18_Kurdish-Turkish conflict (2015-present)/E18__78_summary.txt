Foreign ministry refutes claim after UN expressed concern at lack of response to requests to conduct research in areaThe Turkish foreign ministry has dismissed a UN statement raising alarm over violence against civilians and alleged human rights abuses in predominantly Kurdish south-east Turkey and said it was welcome to visit the region.
Human rights groups have expressed concern about allegations of torture, ill-treatment and extrajudicial killings in towns and districts under curfew, and said access to the region had become increasingly difficult.
Human Rights Watch said the UN should follow up the ministry’s invitation and conduct independent research in Cizre.
“There have been huge problems of access to some areas in the south-east for human rights monitors and journalists.
The government cannot deny access and then accuse everyone of getting it wrong, and this denial fuels concerns of a cover-up.”
