Violence has gripped the region since a conflict between Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants and state security forces reignited last year.
The blast in Sarikamis occurred after PKK fighters packed a stolen truck with explosives, hoping to store the vehicle for future attacks in the village, security sources said.
Officials initially said the truck exploded as militants loaded it and that they intended to use it to attack security forces.
