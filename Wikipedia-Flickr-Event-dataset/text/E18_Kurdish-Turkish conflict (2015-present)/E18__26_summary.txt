ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish security forces have killed 27 militants in the mainly Kurdish southeast, the army said on Friday, a day after the interior minister said security operations had finished in the town of Cizre where the conflict has been focused.
Buildings which were damaged during the security operations and clashes between Turkish security forces and Kurdish militants, are pictured in Sur district of Diyarbakir, Turkey February 11, 2016.
It said it had retrieved the bodies of another 24 militants killed earlier, along with rifles, machines guns and rocket launchers.
More than 800 militants have been killed in Cizre and Sur since they were placed under a round-the-clock curfew in December, the army said.
Authorities imposed the curfews in a bid to root out armed PKK militants who had dug trenches and erected barricades.
