On Tuesday, officials confirmed that the Turkey’s military carried out airstrikes against PKK militants in northern Iraq.
Turkish air units have carried out operations in Iraq since last July, going after members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara views as a terrorist organization.
Last month, Turkish airstrikes were reported to have killed 67 Kurdish militants across northern Iraq.
The Turkish government’s campaign against the PKK in Iraq coincides with the Erdogan administration’s crackdown on Kurdish communities within Turkey.
A curfew was declared in Turkey’s Silvan district last month, as part of an operation intended to root out PKK militants.
