The Turkish military says over 1,000 members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) have been killed since operations against the militants started in the country’s troubled southeastern regions last July.
Turkey’s pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) has strongly slammed Ankara’s military campaign in the Kurdish-populated areas, saying the Turkish military is slaughtering people there.
The Turkish military has also been conducting offensives against the positions of the group in northern Iraq.
The operations began in the wake of a deadly July 2015 bombing in the southern Turkish town of Suruc.
After the bombing, the PKK militants, who accuse the government in Ankara of supporting Daesh, engaged in a series of attacks against Turkish police and security forces, prompting the Turkish military operations.
