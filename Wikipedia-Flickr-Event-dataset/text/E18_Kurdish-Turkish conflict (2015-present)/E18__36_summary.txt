Turkey's armed forces have killed 23 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighters in the latest clashes in eastern Turkey, including three militants who died in an air strike, the general staff says.
The armed forces' statement said three of the militants were killed in the air strikes.
Turkish warplanes have frequently struck PKK targets since the conflict revived, mainly hitting the group's bases in northern Iraq.
Elsewhere, in the southeast, the army killed eight PKK fighters in Silvan, six in Nusaybin and three each in the towns of Sirnak and Yuksekova on Friday, Saturday's statement said.
More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict since the PKK took up arms in 1984.
