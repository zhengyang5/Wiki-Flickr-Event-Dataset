But now Kurdish guerrillas battling Turkey's security forces may now have shoulder-fired missiles â€” an acquisition analysts say will seriously challenge Turkish air power and potentially intensify fighting in the region.
Turkish authorities on Friday had attributed the helicopter crash in Hakkari province to an unknown technical failure.
The chopper had been dispatched, however, after the militants staged an attack that killed six Turkish soldiers in the area.
The PKK, however, has carried out a number of bombings against both civilians and security forces throughout the conflict.
Since then, PKK and other Kurdish guerrillas have killed hundreds of Turkish soldiers in clashes and other attacks, including suicide bombings.
