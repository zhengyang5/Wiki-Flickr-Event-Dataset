The European Parliament (EP) issued sharp criticism of Turkey on Thursday, warning that the EU candidate country was "backsliding" on democracy, human rights and the rule of law, while calling for an end to heavy-handed military operations in the Kurdish populated southeast.
In what has become an annual tradition, Turkey quickly dismissed the report, calling it "null and void."
The concession over Turkey's EU membership was viewed by many critics as undermining European principles.
Nils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe's human rights commissioner, told reporters after visiting the region's largest city Diyarbakir that "respect for human rights has deteriorated at an alarming speed in recent months in the context of Turkey's fight against terrorism."
The Turkish government has vowed to continue military operations until every last "terrorist" is killed or captured.
