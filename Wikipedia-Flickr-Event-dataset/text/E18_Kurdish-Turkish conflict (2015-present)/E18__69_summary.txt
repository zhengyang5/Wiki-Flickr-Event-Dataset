Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has sharply criticized a group of Turkish academics for their call to end violence in Turkey's Southeast, accusing them of being a fifth column of foreign power destined to undermine Turkey's national security.
"Unfortunately these so-called academics claim that the state is carrying out a massacre.
You, those so-called intellectuals!
You are not intellectuals," Erdoğan went on a tirade against the group, claiming they wouldn't even know where the Southeast is located.
Let him see [the] facts [for] himself, not through those "so-called academics" who act as a fifth column," Erdoğan said.
