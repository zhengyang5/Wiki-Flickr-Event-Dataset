There were no reports of fresh strikes on Islamic State positions in Syria, which began in parallel with Turkish attacks on the PKK Friday.
With NATO now giving strong public support to Ankara, analysts say it will likely embolden the Turkish campaign against the PKK in particular.
But observers say the NATO meeting has ended hope of a de-escalation in the conflict between the PKK and Turkish security forces.
The U.S. is backing Turkey's two-pronged air offensive and artillery strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria and Kurdish rebel targets in Iraq.
Any NATO member country, such as Turkey, may ask for consultations when they believe their territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened.
