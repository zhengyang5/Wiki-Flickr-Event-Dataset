Two Turkish soldiers were killed in two separate PKK terrorist attacks in southeastern provinces of Şırnak and Diyarbakır Friday, Turkish military said.
Turkish General Staff said in a statement the soldiers succumbed to their deaths at a hospital after getting injured in PKK terrorist attacks during security operations carried out in Şırnak's Cizre district and Diyarbakır's Sur district.
"Our two hero comrades were critically injured as a result of an armed attack by [PKK] terrorists and have been killed despite all interventions at the hospital," the statement added.
Last month, the Turkish president said more than 3,100 PKK terrorists had been killed in Turkey and northern Iraq.
The PKK -- considered a terrorist organization also by the U.S. and EU -- resumed its three-decade armed campaign against the Turkish state in late July.
