Supporters of the far-right MHP party chant slogans and make the 'wolf sign' (AFP)Throughout the several nights of anti-Kurdish riots that took place in mid-September, the five-fingered “wolf sign” was a ubiquitous sight among the protesters.
The gesture refers to the Grey Wolves, a far-right paramilitary organisation who have antagonised left-wing activists, Kurds and other minority groups in Turkey for decades.
"Most Grey Wolves outside Turkey live here [Germany], probably about 10,000," said Stephen G Humer, chair of the Terrorism Research Network in Berlin.
"German Police often discovers weapons and solves cases of violence with a clear connection to Grey Wolves and their supporters."
