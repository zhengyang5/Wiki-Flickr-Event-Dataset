Turkish police arrested 12 academics on Friday, after they signed a declaration that opposed the country’s military operations against Kurdish rebels in southeastern Turkey, according to state media.
The detained academics are lecturers at Kocaeli University in northwestern Turkey and police are in the process of completing the paperwork for the arrest of nine other academics, the Anadolu news agency reported.
The possible charges that could be brought against the academics are insulting the state and participating in “terrorist propaganda,” according to the Associated Press.
If found guilty, the academics could face up to five years in prison.
The PKK is designated an extremist organization by Turkey, the EU and the U.S.
