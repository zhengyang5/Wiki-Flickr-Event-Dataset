Turkish military helicopters killed nine terrorist Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) members in strikes near the southeastern border with Syria on Wednesday, security sources said, in a conflict becoming increasingly intertwined with developments in Turkey's war-torn neighbor.
The Cobra attack helicopters launched the assault at around 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) as a group of PKK militants travelled through a mountainous area near the İdil district of Turkey's Şırnak province, the sources said.
Parts of İdil were placed under 24-hour curfew last week as the security forces carried out an operation against the militants.
PKK militants have dug trenches and erected barricades in towns and cities, and the death toll has climbed into the hundreds as the security forces try to flush them out.
On Tuesday, security forces killed six PKK militants in İdil and two others in the Sur district of the region's largest city Diyarbakır, the armed forces said in a statement.
