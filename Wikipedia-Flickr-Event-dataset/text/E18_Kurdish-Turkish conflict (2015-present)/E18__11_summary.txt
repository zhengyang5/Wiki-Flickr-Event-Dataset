Image caption The convoy was attacked in Lice, officials saidA car bomb attack on a military convoy in south-eastern Turkey has killed two soldiers and injured four others, Turkish officials say.
The explosion late on Saturday happened in the town of Lice in Diyarbakir, the province governor's office said.
The attack came after Turkey bombed Kurdish separatist camps in northern Iraq - the first such strikes since a peace process began in 2012.
The PKK's military wing killed two Turkish police officers on Wednesday, claiming they had collaborated with IS in the bombing in Suruc.
He added: "There is no connection between these airstrikes against PKK and recent understandings to intensify US-Turkey cooperation against ISIL."
