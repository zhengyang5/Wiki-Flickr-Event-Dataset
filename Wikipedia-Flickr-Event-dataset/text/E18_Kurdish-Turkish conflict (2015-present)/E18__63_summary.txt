Since December, however, confrontations between Turkish security forces and the PKK – listed internationally as a terrorist organisation – have entered an unprecedented stage.
The state imposed urban curfews to “restore public order” in towns where PKK-backed youth militias were resorting to barricades and trenches to claim control.
Those curfews, lasting for days or weeks at a time, have resulted in months-long battles in towns and city districts throughout the south east.
Both attacks have been claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), an offshoot of the PKK.
The PKK argues that the use of heavy weapons in towns and cities provokes a region-wide backlash against Ankara.
