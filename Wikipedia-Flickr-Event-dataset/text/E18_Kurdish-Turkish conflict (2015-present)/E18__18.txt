Diyarbakir, Turkey : Turkey's pro-Kurdish party leader called for "honourable resistance" against security operations in southeast Turkey on Friday as state media reported 55 Kurdish militants had been killed in three days of urban fighting there.

In Cizre, near the Syrian border, gunfire rattled and smoke rose from buildings, while a helicopter flew over the town, Reuters TV footage showed. A soldier and two other people were killed in the latest clash there, security sources said.

The figures indicated a doubling of the death toll in the last 24 hours after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan promised on Thursday the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighters would be "annihilated".

A two-year ceasefire between the PKK and Ankara fell apart in July, shattering peace talks and reviving a conflict that has afflicted the mainly Kurdish southeast for three decades, killing more than 40,000 people.
