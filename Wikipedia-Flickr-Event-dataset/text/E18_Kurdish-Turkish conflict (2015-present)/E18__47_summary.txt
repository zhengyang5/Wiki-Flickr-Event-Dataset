Turkey’s HDP calls for end to demolitions, sieges, ‘illegal’ round-the-clock curfewsANKARAREUTERS photo“As part of a larger war policy, round-the-clock curfews are still going on in Kurdish provinces despite their illegality.
Hundreds of civilians have lost their lives in months-long curfews in the Şırnak city center and 22 other districts.
The main reason behind the government’s refusal to lift round-the-clock curfews is its aim to completely destroy these civilian settlements,” Demirtaş and Yüksekdağ added.
“The ongoing round-the-clock curfews, blockades and destruction in Kurdish cities and towns should be immediately stopped.
Holding both the president and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) responsible for “destruction and suffering,” the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) has called for an urgent end to “illegal round-the-clock curfews” in Turkey’s predominantly Kurdish-populated provinces of the country.
