12 PKK captured in Mersin preparing for bomb attackTurkish security forces captured 12 terrorists of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), including three women, who were making preparations for a bomb attack in the Mediterranean coast city of Mersin.
Security sources said the operation was launched by the Mersin Police Department and the regional office of National Intelligence Agency (MÄ°T) after getting information about the PKK members' activities in the district.
Security forces have intensified counterterrorism operations in recent months after the PKK terrorist group violated a truce deal in July 2015.
Since then, more than 8,000 PKK members have been killed and hundreds more were injured.
The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization in Turkey, the European Union and the United States, has been conducting armed violence in the southeastern part of Turkey since 1984.
