UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Raad al-Hussein urged Turkey to grant the UN unimpeded access to the affected areas.
The car bomb attack targeted a police bus in the Baglar district of Diyarbakir, Turkish media reported, quoting local officials.
Earlier this year Turkey imposed curfews on Cizre and other parts of the troubled south-east, as its security forces battled PKK fighters there.
"It is essential that the authorities respect human rights at all times while undertaking security or counter-terrorism operations," Mr Hussein said.
Separately, US-based watchdog Human Rights Watch said that in the past two months there had been cases of Turkish border guards shooting and beating Syrian asylum seekers and smugglers.
