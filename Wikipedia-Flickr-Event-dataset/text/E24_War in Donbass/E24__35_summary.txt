DONETSK, Ukraine — Deep strains emerged Thursday in the ranks of Ukraine’s pro-Moscow insurgents as dozens turned in their weapons in disgust at Russian inaction and bickering broke out between rebel factions.
Girkin, a Russian better known by his assumed name Strelkov, has attained hero status among supporters of the insurgency.
The ill will also appears to stem from a feeling among the rebels that Russia has done too little to help them.
While rebels hold Donetsk, the city’s international airport, which has been closed since early May, remains in government hands.
“What awaits them when this is all over and the Ukrainian authorities are here?”Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report.
