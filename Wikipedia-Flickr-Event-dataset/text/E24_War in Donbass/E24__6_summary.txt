The exit of the Chechen fighters, who played a prominent role when Russia instigated the war a year ago, has triggered speculation.
The picture painted by the separatist commander was also backed up by a foreign journalist who witnessed Chechen fighters in detention.
The exact number of Chechen fighters in Donbas is unknown, but members of the Death Battalion – the most prominent Chechen group – have said their group numbers at least 300.
Friction between Chechen fighters and other rebels has surfaced repeatedly in recent months, with news of one Chechen fighter being killed by rebels in a nightclub late March.
Last May, the Caucasian Knot news agency reported that the bodies of dozens of Chechen men had been returned home from Ukraine for burial, citing family members.
