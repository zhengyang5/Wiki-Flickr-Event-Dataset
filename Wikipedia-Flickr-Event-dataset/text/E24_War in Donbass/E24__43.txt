While the advance of pro-Russian separatists across a swath of southern Ukraine stirred alarm Wednesday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the president’s office in Kiev to complain about the conduct of the war in the east of the country, where five battalions of volunteer fighters were reportedly cut off by a rebel counterattack.

Concern about the volunteers stranded in the town of Ilovaysk, outside Donetsk, was fueled by an angry Facebook post from the commander of one of the battalions, Semen Semenchenko, who accused the government of abandoning his men, and by new video uploaded to YouTube that gave a vivid sense of the intensity of the battle there.

The combat footage, accompanying a dispatch from Ilovaysk by a correspondent for the Ukrainian news site LB, showed fighters from the all-volunteer Donbass Battalion treating their wounded comrades on Tuesday in a school they were using as a base, and engaging in a firefight with the rebels.

The protesters in Kiev were called to the streets by Mr. Semenchenko, the battalion’s commander, who was wounded in battle and evacuated from Ilovaysk last week during fighting that also claimed the life of a 55-year-old American volunteer, Mark Paslawsky.

According to Ukrainian activists and independent media reports, President Petro O. Poroshenko told representatives of the protesters Wednesday that the government would send reinforcements to relieve the volunteers trapped in Ilovaysk.

Russian state television broadcast less dramatic video from the other side of the front line in a report from Ilovaysk on Wednesday.

Supporters of the separatists posted on YouTube footage of the rebel counteroffensive there last week, and the difficult conditions for residents trapped by the fighting, including video on the site ICorpus.ru.
