Angry locals surrounded General Vasily Krutov, yelling questions about what he and his troops were doing in their city.
As the crowd surged towards the airfield entrance in Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine, waving a Russian flag on a long branch, the Ukrainian troops inside unleashed a volley of shots into the air.
A similar group of armed men later stormed a government building in Kramatorsk with a flurry of gunfire, although no one was injured.
At one point, a group of men began punching Krutov in the head, knocking off his military-issue fur hat.
Asked if another ultimatum would be given to those who had seized buildings, Krutov said that would be "too humanitarian".
