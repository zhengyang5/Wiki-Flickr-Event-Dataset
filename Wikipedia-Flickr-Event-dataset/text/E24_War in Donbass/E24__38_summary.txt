The army has begun an “advance across all fronts,” Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, told reporters.
The heightened military campaign comes days after a missile downed flight MH17 in the Donetsk region, killing all 298 people on board.
Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukraine is to blame because it ended a cease-fire with the rebels last month.
‘Enormous’ AdvantageWhile the insurgents repelled tanks near Donetsk, Ukraine’s forces have an “enormous” technical advantage, according to Borodai, who said he’s seeking a resumption of cease-fire talks.
The army deployed warplanes and fired Grad missiles in the outskirts of the city of 1 million, he said.
