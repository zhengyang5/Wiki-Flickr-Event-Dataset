Russian tanks have been filmed rumbling through Ukraine as president Barack Obama has laid blame for the conflict squarely with Russia.
A Ukraine security spokesman has also said two columns of tanks from Russia have entered a strategic town.
He called that a conservative estimate and said another 20,000 Russian troops were right over the Russian border.
A Russian diplomatic source said: 'The Russian authorities clearly said many times there are no regular Russian troops there.
The US also warned that an increasing number of Russian troops and ultra-modern equipment were directly involved in fighting inside Ukraine.
