Speaking in a televised cabinet meeting, President Petro Poroshenko said: "According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border.
Ukraine and the west have repeatedly accused Russia of fuelling the five-month pro-Russian rebellion with arms, vehicles and undercover Russian troops.
Poroshenko said parts of east Ukraine would be given special status.
There is no question of federalisation or separation of any Ukrainian territory," he said.
On Wednesday, Poroshenko signed a law allowing Ukraine to impose its own sanctions against Russian firms and individuals deemed to be backing the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
