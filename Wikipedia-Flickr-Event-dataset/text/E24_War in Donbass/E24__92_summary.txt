The National Police on Friday detained eight Spaniards suspected of fighting alongside pro-Russian forces in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
The eight Spaniards belong to several different communist organizations, and had received support from an unofficial pro-Russian European network.
The operation was completed after three of the men returned to Spain during February â€“ the last of the men arrived last week.
Police sources have indicated that another group of young Spaniards, also pro-Russian and linked to communist movements, were preparing to travel to Ukraine.
Combatants have traveled from all of these countries from Ukraine, some of them via the so-called Ukraine Anti-Fascist Support Committee.
