I’m sure you know this perfectly well, but may I point out that if there aren’t Russian military or Russian armament in east Ukraine, you will get nothing that matches your criteria of respectable neutral sources.
But mostly you have things sourced from the Ukraine Ministry of Truth and laundered.
You are not asking for evidence that Russia has invaded Ukraine or has deployed units in Ukraine or is a party to the war.
You are not asking whether Russia is at war with Ukraine.
You are not asking whether Russia is guilty of aggression against Ukraine.
