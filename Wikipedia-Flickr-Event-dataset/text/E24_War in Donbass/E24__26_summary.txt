At least five people were killed in fighting between pro-Russian militiamen and Ukrainian forces near Donetsk.
A plea by Ukraine’s richest man for demonstrations against Russian-backed separatists met with a mixed response Tuesday as many of his own workers stayed on their jobs.
“The main thing is nobody’s shooting.”Minutes after the sirens sounded, Denis Pushilin, a leader of the separatists’ self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, sent out a tweet saying rebels would begin nationalizing the properties of “regional oligarchs” for their refusal to pay taxes to the Donetsk People’s Republic.
He said workers pay lip service to Akhmetov’s calls for pro-Ukrainian support because they owe their salaries to him.
At the burned-out city council building that pro-Russian separatists had previously seized, a dozen supporters of the Donetsk People’s Republic expressed contempt for Akhmetov’s demonstrations.
