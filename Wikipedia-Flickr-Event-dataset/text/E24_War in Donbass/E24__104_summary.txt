The Donbas insurgency was an only partially domestic event.
Kudelia’s attack on those suspecting a “clandestine organization coordinated from a single center” is defeated by Kudelia’s own apolitical narrative.
The earlier take-overs of administrations were directed against one particular Ukrainian political regime and not against the Ukrainian state.
The Donbas insurgency may have, in its early phase, copied the events further west.
