As events unfold in Ukraine, the Ukraine Informational Resistance -- a network of Ukrainian professors and intellectuals in Ukraine and abroad -- will keep The WorldPost readers informed about events from their perspective.
According to our data, for the last three days at total of 250 of "Putin's tourists" and saboteurs from the Transnistrian region entered the territory of Ukraine.
They, as citizens of Ukraine, living in Crimea and recruited by Russian security services, enter the continent one by one or in small groups, disguised as ordinary citizens.
In close coordination with local separatists, they receive weapons upon joining the rest of the extremists in the mainland Ukraine.
Ukrainian security services have also taken measures to neutralize these saboteurs.
