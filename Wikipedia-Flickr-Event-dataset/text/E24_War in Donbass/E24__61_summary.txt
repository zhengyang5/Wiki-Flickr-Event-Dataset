The warring parties in Ukraine agreed Thursday to a February 15 ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front lines in a deal French President François Hollande called a "comprehensive political solution" after marathon talks in Minsk.
French President François Hollande called the deal a "comprehensive political solution" and said it provides "serious hope, even if all is not done".
"We proceed from the assumption that all parties will show restraint in the nearest future, before the start of the ceasefire," he said.
As the deal was being agreed in Minsk on Thursday, both rebels and government troops reported fresh fighting across east Ukraine.
Moscow has denied those accusations, saying any Russians fighting in east Ukraine are volunteers.
