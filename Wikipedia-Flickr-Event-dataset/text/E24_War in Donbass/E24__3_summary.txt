The Cossack renaissance swept through Russia and Ukraine with equal force.
The chairman of the Council of Atamans (village headmen) at the Union of Cossack Organisations in the Donetsk Region was Vadim Zhmurin; he was also head of the Union of Ukrainian Cossack Organisations.
Initially there were almost no Russian volunteers, leading Igor Samus, founder of a sports centre teaching Cossack martial arts in Donetsk, to say that they had been betrayed by the Russian Cossacks.
President Poroshenko does not subscribe to the ideal of Cossack self-ruleGenuine Ukrainian Cossacks, in his words, are 'guardians of their land and family' and they 'support their country.'
'As for Poroshenko, he was elected by Ukrainians; Cossacks respect the choice of their own people,' adds Sergei Shcherbakov.
