Kyiv, Ukraine—A new poll by the International Republican Institute’s (IRI) Center for Insights in Survey Research reveals that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians think the war-torn Donbas region should remain part of Ukraine.
The survey contained an over-sample of respondents from the Ukrainian-controlled areas of the Donbas, a majority of whom also affirmed their wish for the entire region to stay in Ukraine.
Only six percent nationwide and four percent in the Donbas believe that these areas should either be separated from Ukraine or become part of Russia.
Only a combined 10 percent in the Donbas believe the authorities are doing enough—a 14 percent decrease since IRI’s previous oversample of the region in November 2015.
Seventy-two percent of Donbas residents cited job creation and economic improvements as the best ways to keep the Donbas part of Ukraine.
