Outnumbered six-to-one, at least one Ukrainian Donbas Volunteer Battalion member was killed and 20 were wounded in an ambush by 150-200 pro-Russian separatists in the village of Karlivka, 35 kilometers northwest of Donetsk, the quasi-military unitâ€™s press center said.
Reporting from Karlivka, Agence France-Presse stated that at least four separatists were also killed in the same confrontation.
Fighters from the nationalist group Praviy Sektor subsequently joined the fight and succeeded in partially breaking the encirclement to allow the core of the Donbas Battalion to escape, said Praviy Sektor leader Dmytro Yarosh on Facebook.
Meanwhile, the press service of the Right Sector says that four soldiers of the Donbas battalion were captured, or killed.
There were no losses among the Right Sector fighters, but two soldiers received light injuries, Interfax Ukraine reported.
