Ukrainian authorities insist that, in fact, Russian heavy weapons already are deployed and Russian personnel already are fighting in Donbass, as eastern Ukraine is known.
The Ukrainian authorities say it was the Kremlin, specifically Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu, that has coordinated all of Strelkov’s actions.
His army, he claimed, had to purchase its arsenal for “a fabulous sum of money.” Apparently, to win the war, Strelkov also needed more professional fighters to use that newfound arsenal.
Strelkov’s mission in Ukraine, whoever gave it to him, has been bigger than just the defense of the DPR.
If Strelkov pushes too far, he could find himself a lone gunman in a very lonely war.
