KYIV -- Ukraine's parliament has passed a bill that backers, including President Poroshenko, say will help Kyiv restore control over areas in the east that are held by Russia-backed separatists.
It goes to Poroshenko, who backed the legislation and celebrated its passage in social-media posts after the vote.
â€‹The bill labels Russia an "aggressor" and the separatist-held parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces -- part of what is known as the Donbas -- as "temporarily occupied territories."
The pact obliged Kyiv to adopt legislation granting substantial autonomy to the separatist-held regions -- an idea that has come under fire from many politicians in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian military said on January 18 that one soldier had been killed in eastern Ukraine in the previous 24 hours.
