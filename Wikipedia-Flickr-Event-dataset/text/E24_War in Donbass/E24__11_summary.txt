Don't look now but it's been one hell of a deadly month in the Donbas.
Yesterday, three Ukrainian servicemen were killed and three more were wounded.

The war in the Donbas has become the forgotten war.
And in this sense, the forgotten war in the Donbas is serving the purpose that Russia intended it to serve.
