KIEV (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with top security chiefs on Thursday over a “deterioration of the situation” in eastern Ukraine after pro-Russian rebels there accused Kiev of launching a new offensive in violation of a ceasefire.

Rebels say Ukraine has violated the deal by seeking to revoke a law that would have granted eastern regions autonomy.
Kiev says this was a consequence of Sunday’s separatist leadership elections which it says go against the agreement.
