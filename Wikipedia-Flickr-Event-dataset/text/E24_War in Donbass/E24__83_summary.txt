Word spread quickly through the few hundred pro-Russian protesters in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine: "The miners are coming!"
Although many of the protesters occupying the Donetsk administration building wear masks, the miners among them are easy to spot.
But most miners support greater independence from Kiev, according to those present.
A miner's work is tough, especially in the ageing coal mines of the Donbass.
Many protesters see the new Kiev government as dominated by nationalists from western Ukraine, which has a largely agrarian economy.
