Ceasefire talks on Ukraine failed to secure a breakthrough ending hours after Kiev ordered its army to withdraw from a key eastern airport after coming under a ferocious assault from separatists fighters reportedly backed by a Russian army tank column.
“In the Lugansk direction, Ukrainian forces received an order and pulled back from the airport,” Ukraine army spokesman Andriy Lysenko said.
Footage broadcast on Russian state television showed tanks firing as combat raged around the airport building, which appeared to have been heavily damaged during weeks of fighting.
Despite Ukraine’s assertions to the contrary and mounting evidence on the ground of the presence of Russian troops, the Kremlin has repeatedly denied that its military is operating inside Ukraine.
Valentina Melnikova, head of the Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers, the main organisation representing the families of servicemen, said some 7,000 to 8,000 Russian troops are believed to be in Ukraine at present.
