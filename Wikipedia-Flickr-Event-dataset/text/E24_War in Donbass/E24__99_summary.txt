The hearing, entitled "U.S. policy in Ukraine: Russian opposition and stimulating reforms," was held in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the upper house of the U.S. Congress.
Evidence is mounting of heavy Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine since the beginning of the armed stage of the unrest there in April.
Ukrainian soldiers also say that it was largely regular Russian troops who attacked and captured the key strategic town of Debaltseve in Donetsk region, again in breach of the latest February 15 ceasefire â€“ a claim corroborated by interviews published in the Russian media with Russian soldiers who said they participated in the battle.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later admitted that Russian troops had been involved, and awarded some of them medals for taking part in the takeover operation.
Putin has since also admitted that planning for the Russian takeover of Crimea started even before former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had left Ukraine.
