The man who Ukraineâ€™s Security Service (SBU) wants most in eastern Ukraine, alleged Russian Military Intelligence Colonel Igor Strelkov, has emerged beyond command-and-control recordings to give a news conference in the restive city of Sloviansk on April 26, reported Life News, a Russian media outlet.
He is believed to be the chief commander of pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine in charge of Russian Military Intelligence personnel, subversives, militants, and a network of Russian and Ukrainian agents working on behalf of Russia.

Officials in Moscow have denied any involvement in the unrest in eastern Ukraine and claim that Ukrainians are the only ones taking part in a separatist movement.
The SBU has implicated Strelkov in the ambush of a Ukrainian anti-terrorist team on April 13 that left one SBU captain dead.
