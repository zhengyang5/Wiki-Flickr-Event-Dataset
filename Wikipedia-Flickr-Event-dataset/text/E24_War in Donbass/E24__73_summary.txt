Russia has insisted that it is not involved in the conflict, despite extensive evidence that has been sending arms, money and soldiers to support the rebel cause.
PhotoThe protracted negotiations over Wednesday’s prisoner swap involved Viktor V. Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian with close ties to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.
The Russian leader, who is up for re-election in March, saw his popularity ratings in Russia soar after he grabbed Crimea but he has garnered no discernible political benefit from Russia’s intervention in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine was originally supposed to return 306 prisoners to rebel-held territory but said that 40 of these had already been released and did not show up for the exchange, carried out at checkpoint near the rebel-held town of Horlivka.
A further 29 captives held by Ukraine refused to return to rebel-held territory, Ukrainian officials said.
