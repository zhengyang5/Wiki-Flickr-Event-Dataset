They all lived in Madrid, but they met on the front in Ukraine as part of the pro-Russian Donbass International Brigades.
They were paid neither travel expenses nor a salary, but they were received with open arms“Half of them are communists and the other half are Nazis,” they explained.
“We fought together, communists and Nazis alike […].
We all want the same: social justice and the liberation of Russia from the Ukrainian invasion.”At the moment, Spanish police only have proof that one of the Madrileños arrested fought on the front lines.
The police have accused them of compromising the peace and interests of Spain, homicide, and possession of arms and explosives.
