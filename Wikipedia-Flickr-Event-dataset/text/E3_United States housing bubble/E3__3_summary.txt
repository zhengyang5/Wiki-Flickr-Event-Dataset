Countless articles in the financial and popular press have now been devoted to the question of whether we are in a housing "bubble."
Others, who apparently slept through the 80 percent decline in the NASDAQ, don't believe bubbles are possible in a free market economy.
House prices in these zones look remarkably similar to the rise in the S&P 500 during the 1990s stock market bubble (see chart below).
Just as cheerleaders of the high-tech bubble of the late 1990s developed ever more creative explanations for why traditional metrics of valuing stocks no longer applied, the same has been true during the housing bubble.
WHILE THE EVIDENCE OF A HOUSING BUBBLE is overwhelming, it isn't definitive.
