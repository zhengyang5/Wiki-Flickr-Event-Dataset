WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Home prices are back to their March 2004 levels, having dropped in 20 major U.S. cities by 2.2% in October and by a record 18% from the previous year, according to the Case-Shiller price index published Tuesday by Standard & Poor's.
Prices have fallen in all 20 cities compared with both the prior month and October 2007, and 14 of the 20 metro areas showed record rates of annual declines.
"The main force driving house prices down are foreclosures, which are still rising," Newport wrote in a research note.
Prices in cities that are near an equilibrium could still decline because the "number of homes on the market remains high," he addedFor Case-Shiller's original 10-city index, prices fell a record 19.1% in the previous 12 months.
Elsewhere Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence hit a record low in December, as worries increased about current business and labor-market conditions.
