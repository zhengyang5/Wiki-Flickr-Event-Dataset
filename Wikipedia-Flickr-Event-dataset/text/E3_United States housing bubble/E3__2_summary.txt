Housing woes take bigger toll on economy than expected: PaulsonWASHINGTON (AFP) â€” The woes of the US housing market are dragging on longer than expected, and may lead to over one million foreclosure notices this year for homeowners, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Tuesday.
"And it now looks like it will continue to adversely impact our economy, our capital markets and many homeowners for some time yet.
Paulson said home foreclosures are rising sharply, especially on subprime loans granted to people with weak credit histories.
"Current trends suggest there will be just over one million foreclosure starts this year -- of which 620,000 are subprime," Paulson said.
"Despite strong economic fundamentals, the housing decline is still unfolding and I view it as the most significant risk to our economy," he said.
