NEVER before have real house prices risen so fast, for so long, in so many countries.
It is true that, unlike share prices, house prices tend to be somewhat “sticky” downwards.
When house prices had been rising, borrowing against capital gains on homes to finance other spending had surged.
Although house prices did not fall, this housing-equity withdrawal plunged after 2001, removing a powerful stimulus to spending.
Americans who believe that house prices can only go up and pose no risk to their economy would be well advised to look overseas.
