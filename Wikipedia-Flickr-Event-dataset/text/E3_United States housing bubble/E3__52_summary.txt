Collateralized debt obligations, known as CDOs, are structured finance products that bunch together a portfolio of bonds and other fixed-income asset into a new blended security.
This is because the value of CDOs is measured by a "marked to market" technique that pegs them to their value in the market, rather than their book value.
Complicating the situation is the fact that CDOs containing mortgage-backed securities seldom trade, which can mean that their "marked to market" value does not reflect recent events.
"This would force other hedge funds to similarly mark down the value of their holdings.
He further cautioned that the impact of hedge fund losses would be pale in contrast to the likely impact of an open market auction of subprime CDOs.
