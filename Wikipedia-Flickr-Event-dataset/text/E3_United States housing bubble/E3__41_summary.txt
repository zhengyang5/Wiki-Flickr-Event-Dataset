Compared to Japan in the 1990s and even more so America in the 1930s, America today has seemingly absorbed the bursting of a stock market bubble seemingly well.
But the sector that poses the biggest threat to the economy is the household sector which is spending and borrowing at an unsustainable level.
And third, there is always a great risk that asset values will decline, even while debt levels are fixed.
If you look at real interest rates you'll find that they are at historically very low levels.
The conclusion is that Alan Greenspan and George W. Bush did not prevent the stock market bubble of the late 1990s from turning into a crisis.
