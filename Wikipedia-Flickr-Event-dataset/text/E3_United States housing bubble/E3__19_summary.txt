The economic damage this time could be worse than in the past because house prices are more likely to fall in nominal, not just real terms.
In America this could mean the first fall in average house prices since the Great Depression.
Even if prices there initially just flatten rather than fall, this will hurt consumer spending as the impulse to borrow against capital gains disappears.
If house prices actually fall, this boost will turn into a substantial drag.
Of course, by the time American prices begin to fall, probably sometime next year, they will not be Mr Greenspan's headache.
