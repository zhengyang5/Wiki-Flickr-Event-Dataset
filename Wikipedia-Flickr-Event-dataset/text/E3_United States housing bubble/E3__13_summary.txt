WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd said on Monday he asked executives at five big subprime mortgage companies to testify at a Thursday hearing and explain their lending practices.
Executives from HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), New Century Mortgage Corp. NEWC.PK, Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N, General Electric Co.â€™s (GE.N) WMC Mortgage unit and First Franklin Mortgage were invited to testify, Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a statement.
The subprime market is the riskiest segment of the U.S. mortgage market and serves borrowers with poor credit histories.
At least 20 lenders in the subprime mortgage sector have gone out of business as a result.
Dodd has said that regulators bear some responsibility for the recent downturn in the subprime mortgage market, vowing to bring them before the Senate panel to explain how the subprime market has arrived to this point.
