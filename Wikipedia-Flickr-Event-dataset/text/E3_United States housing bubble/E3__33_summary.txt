RON PAUL OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE September 10, 2003 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Subsidies Distort the Housing Market Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing on the Treasury Department’s views regarding government sponsored enterprises (GSEs).
Today, I will introduce the Free Housing Market Enhancement Act, which removes government subsidies from the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and the National Home Loan Bank Board.
After all, if Fannie and Freddie were not underwritten by the federal government, investors would demand Fannie and Freddie provide assurance that they follow accepted management and accounting practices.
No less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed concern that government subsidies provided to GSEs make investors underestimate the risk of investing in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
I hope today’s hearing sheds light on how special privileges granted to GSEs distort the housing market and endanger American taxpayers.
