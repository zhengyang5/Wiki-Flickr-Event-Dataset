Housing and credit troubles took more of a toll on the U.S. economy as prices on pre-owned single-family homes tumbled in the third quarter and consumer confidence in November sank to a two-year low, reports on Tuesday showed.
The S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index also fell 1.7 percent from June, marking the largest quarterly decline in the indexâ€™s 21-year history, S&P said in a statement.

Home prices around San Diego, California, and economically depressed Detroit, Michigan declined by 9.6 percent over the 12-month period.
