A decade ago, the U.S. housing market swelled to a bubble of epic proportions.
They are being driven by a severe lack of supply of homes for sale, as well as near record low mortgage rates.
Also, low rates may make homes affordable, but a sizable number of potential buyers still can't qualify for those low rates and/or cannot meet the down payment requirements.
Home equity, while keeping the housing market healthy, is also driving prices higher.
All these dynamics, unique to today's housing market, continue to put upward pressure on home prices.
