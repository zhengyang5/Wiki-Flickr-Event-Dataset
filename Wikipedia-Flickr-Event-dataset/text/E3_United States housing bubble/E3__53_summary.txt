PARIS, Aug. 9 — The French bank BNP Paribas suspended operations of three of its funds and the European Central Bank injected cash into the financial system, both in the wake of turmoil in the United States mortgage market.
The European Central Bank lent 94.8 billion euros, or $130.1 billion, to meet banks’ needs after demand for cash in the European money markets drove interest rates higher.
The central bank, taking such emergency action for the first time since just after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, said it would provide unlimited amounts at 4 percent, its current benchmark rate.
The actions initiated a sell-off in European markets that spilled over into the United States.
Also today, the Dutch lender NIBC Holding said it had lost $189 million on United States mortgage investments.
