The February reading for the National Activity Index (NAI) fell to -1.04 from -0.68 in January, with all four broad categories in the index negative.
It was the three-month moving average (MA3M) of the index which the Chicago Fed says created the recession signal.
Sixty-five of the 85 national indicators were negative in February, and just 20 made positive contributions.
