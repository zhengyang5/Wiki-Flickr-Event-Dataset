Via Mark Thoma, Economics of Contempt has done [did] a yeoman job [back in 2008] of assembling quotes from pundits/economists who insisted that there was no housing bubble.
As he suggests, some of this was my fault: I said there was a housing bubble, which to them was sufficient demonstration that there wasn’t.
Beyond that, to suggest that there was a housing bubble was to denigrate the wonderful Bush Boom.
One question is whether you can find clear bubble denial, or at least denial that anything really bad was going to happen, from more respectable economists.
Another phenomenon is the curious case of late bubble denial — economists insisting that there was no bubble well after the collapse was already underway.
