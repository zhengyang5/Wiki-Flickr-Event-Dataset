”The bottom line is so many people took the fashionable mortgage rather than the right mortgage,” said Harry Brousaides Jr., president of NorthStar Mortgage Corp. in Westwood.
Buyers struggling to finance a home took on mortgages with low adjustable rates that nevertheless swallowed half their monthly take-home pay, leaving little financial cushion.
The no-down-payment loans got them into the market quickly, before they were locked out by rising prices.
But, as rates increased, these loans, which often carry an adjustable interest rate, become more expensive.
As a last resort in a rising market, he said, people could sell the house and pay off the loans.
