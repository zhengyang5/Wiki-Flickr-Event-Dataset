PARIS, Aug. 9 — The French bank BNP Paribas suspended operations of three of its funds and the European Central Bank injected cash into the financial system, both in the wake of turmoil in the United States mortgage market.

The European Central Bank lent 94.8 billion euros, or $130.1 billion, to meet banks’ needs after demand for cash in the European money markets drove interest rates higher. The central bank, taking such emergency action for the first time since just after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, said it would provide unlimited amounts at 4 percent, its current benchmark rate.

The actions initiated a sell-off in European markets that spilled over into the United States.

BNP is the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several major companies have already announced losses.

A German central bank meeting was under way today to discuss details of a rescue package for the lender IKB Deutsche Industriebank, another victim of exposure to the crisis in subprime lending. Also today, the Dutch lender NIBC Holding said it had lost $189 million on United States mortgage investments.

Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for BNP, said that the credit squeeze in the United States had made it impossible to calculate the value of the underlying assets of the funds and that the bank was obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out or new investors from buying shares.
