That touched off a debate about what that $15.6 billion bailout profit meant.
By my math, that $15.6 billion is only about 1/ 25 of the profit that taxpayers have realized on the bailout.
Thatâ€™s right, $350 billion.
Absent the federal bailout, those firms would have gone into bankruptcy, and their shareholders would have gotten nothing.
And a $350 billion (and growing) profit is a lot better than a $15.6 billion profit.
