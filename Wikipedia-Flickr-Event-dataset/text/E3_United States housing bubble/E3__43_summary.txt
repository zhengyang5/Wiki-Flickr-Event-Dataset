That low interest rates have been the driving force behind real estate's unprecedented rise is not a point of debate among economists.
Yet, many economists have been arguing that higher rates won't hurt housing.

"As you get higher interest rates renting is going to look better than buying," Baker added.
"I'd be most concerned in places where housing affordability is an issue because the effects of rising interest rates are even more pronounced," said Stiff.
