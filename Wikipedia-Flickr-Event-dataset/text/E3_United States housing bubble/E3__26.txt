WASHINGTON Â— The economy is slowing. The question is, how much. In the past several weeks, a slew of data on housing, manufacturing and employment has bolstered Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's forecast for moderating growth and diminishing inflation that should eventually eliminate the need for interest rate increases. But even as stock and bond markets begin celebrating an economic soft landing, a number of economists are crashing the party and trying to bring it down. They warn that growth could plunge far lower or inflation persist at higher levels than the Fed expects. Adding to the uncertainty is Main Street sentiment. An Aug. 7-10 Gallup Poll found only 22% of Americans think the economy is getting better, the lowest confidence level in five years. Recent surveys by Moody's Economy.com and the National Federation of Independent Business indicate executives of both large and small firms generally foresee sustained, though somewhat more muted, growth. Declining confidence is most pronounced in U.S. construction and real estate firms. "The public mood is very apprehensive," says Jim Owens, CEO of Caterpillar, noting that though spending is healthy, people are carrying high debt and are worried about oil prices, international strife and other factors. "Business executives are looking at some pretty strong profits, strong global (economic) growth," says Owens, whose company posted robust earnings in the second quarter. "We're in a world today of relatively low inflation, relatively low interest rates for this stage of the business cycle" and pent-up demand for capital investment, which yields a strong outlook. Why the wide range of views? One reason is the inherent difficulty in forecasting at turning points in the economy. More narrowly, the differences hinge on how economists, executives and consumers gauge key economic factors: the depth and breadth of the housing decline, the outlook for oil prices, the pace of economic growth abroad and whether inflation has spread beyond energy prices. "This soft-landing scenario is a fantasy," says Ed Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast. While he doesn't expect a recession in the next year, he predicts the housing slowdown will be nastier than the Fed projects, hurting consumer spending, jobs and growth. "Anything housing-related is going to feel like a recession, almost like a depression." The University of Michigan's midyear forecast, issued last week, foresees the weakest growth in five years, with the economy held back by higher interest rates, oil prices and inflation. Jim Paulsen of Wells Capital Management says, however, that market indicators that should be flashing red if the economy is in big danger, aren't. Stocks are outperforming bonds, emerging markets and non-energy commodity prices are recovering, and non-auto retail sales are up more than 10% on an annual basis since the end of 2005. Housing is slowing in previously overheated markets but is up in other regions. "Here we are in the midst of a 'slowdown,' and we're coming off a 16% (corporate) profits quarter? What the heck is that?" Paulsen says. "I can't remember a housing cycle that hurt anybody because it only went up at 3%." Then there is a small but growing minority of economists who warn that the downturn could be severe. New York University professor Nouriel Roubini gives 70% odds of a recession by year's end. Merrill Lynch analyst David Rosenberg puts the chances of a recession at 40% to 80% in the coming year, based on models and market conditions. A recent Blue Chip survey of economists pegged the risk at 27%, up from earlier estimates. "This is a tipping point for the consumer and the economy," Roubini says. He spells out a long list of potential risks that could push the country into trouble. Among them: unregulated hedge funds, housing, foreign trade uncertainty, the need to finance the nation's huge trade deficit, Middle East unrest and the potential for terrorism. The Fed's forecast is for growth to moderate but not stall. The central bank expects the economy to expand by a respectable 3.25% to 3.5% in 2006, core inflation (which excludes food and energy) to average 2.25% to 2.5%, and the jobless rate to stay at 4.75% to 5%. Overall, the economy grew 3.2% in 2005, even with the disruptions and high energy prices arising from Hurricane Katrina. The central bank's predicted slowdown has begun. The economy grew at a 5.6% annual rate in the first quarter and a 2.5% pace in the second. Slower consumer spending accounted for most of the drop. Production at factories, mines and utilities in July rose at half June's pace. Long-term interest rates have been below short-term rates, in the past a signal of a downturn. Energy prices remain elevated, with gasoline at $2.92 per gallon on average. Companies are now creating an average of about 110,000 net new jobs per month, down from 180,000 earlier this year. Still, the jobless rate is a tight 4.8%. Existing home sales have fallen about 9% from last year, with new-home sales off 11%. Ginny Ferguson, broker and co-owner of Heritage Valley Mortgage in Pleasanton, Calif., is seeing a higher level of cash-out mortgage refinancing this year, despite slower price growth and higher interest rates, as people use home equity to consolidate existing debt. "As far as having a lot of credit card debt, we're seeing an awful lot of people with that," Ferguson says. "What people may be doing is cleaning up some of the mess they've created for themselves." Some signs of strength The news is not all bad. Economists, including UBS Investment Research, predict the government will revise second-quarter growth figures to above 3%, based on inventory buildup and other factors, though that could dim later expansion. Exports are up. Factories are running nearer capacity, and some businesses are having trouble finding skilled workers. Commercial construction is rising, picking up some of the slack from housing. Retail sales and orders for long-lasting durable goods jumped in July. Mortgage rates are leveling out. Business capital spending has been good. Duke Energy, which provides electricity to homes and businesses in the Southeast and Midwest, is embarking on a multibillion-dollar capital expansion, planning new coal gasification and other plants to serve growing demand. "The economy has been extremely resilient in the face of significant headwinds," says Duke Energy CEO Jim Rogers. "I see the economy being kind of a steady grower, not the growth we had in the late '90s, but more sustainable." High gasoline prices have pinched consumers at the lower end of the income ladder, hurting earnings of big-box chains such as Wal-Mart. Some higher-end retailers such as Nordstrom are doing well. Still, at Exclusive Resorts, where clients pay a one-time membership fee and annual dues for use of 400 high-end homes in the USA and abroad, July sales were 50% above any month since the firm started three years ago. "We expect to have a better year in 2007 than even in 2006," says Exclusive Resorts President Donn Davis. The average net worth of Davis' clients is $5 million. Risks: Oil and housing The energy sector is a huge unknown. Oil prices have dropped to about $72.63 a barrel from a recent high of $77 a barrel. But demand is high, supplies are tight and even a slight disruption could send prices soaring. "There's a lot of risk out there on the downside, and there's not much upside potential for growth," says Ross Gittell, a professor at the University of New Hampshire who also does regional forecasts for the New England Economic Partnership. Stock and bond markets have jumped on recent small dips in inflation that could easily be reversed with another oil shock. The other big variable is housing. After adding to growth in the past several years, the sector has become a drag, with the drop in home construction shaving as much as 1 percentage point off gross domestic product, says economist Peter Morici of the University of Maryland. The impact could be far greater if the market falls faster. The slowing housing market will affect construction, employment and consumer spending, as people are less able to draw on the rising equity in their homes. "Energy prices matter, but they don't play the kind of role that housing is going to play," says UCLA's Leamer. "The Fed can do very little now. ... It made a major error by letting this housing sector get out of control." Others say the correction will not be that steep or disruptive. Frank Nothaft, chief economist at mortgage giant Freddie Mac, doesn't anticipate a recession. Nothaft predicts that home sales (excluding condos) will drop 7.5% from 2005, but that they will still post one of the strongest years in history. Prices should rise about 7% in 2006 and 6.4% next year. Mortgage rates have fallen recently and are about 6.5% for a 30-year fixed mortgage, still low in historic terms. "We see nothing that would suggest housing is going to fall off the cliff; quite the opposite," says Richard Smith, vice chairman and president of Realogy, which includes Century 21 and Coldwell Banker. Smith says there will be a shakeup as investors who got into the market during the boom are forced to exit. But he says many fears are unfounded or media-fed. So far, the impact on consumer spending hasn't been as great as expected, partly because consumers have increased credit card usage. The percentage of homeowners taking equity out of their homes in refinancing transactions in the second quarter was the highest since 1990, Freddie Mac says. Even if the United States does make a smooth transition to slower growth in the short term, the long-term picture is clouded by high trade and budget deficits, low national savings and the pending retirement of the baby boomers, which will put huge stress on federal programs. Schering-Plough Chairman and CEO Fred Hassan's company is doing well, due in large part to healthy world economic growth and expansion in Russia, for example. But over the horizon, difficulty finding skilled U.S. scientists, intense international competition and the high trade deficit are worries. "We are now becoming the wealth storage depot for the world, but how long can you fill a depot with other people's money?" Hassan asks.
