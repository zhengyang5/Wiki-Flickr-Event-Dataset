WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Home prices are back to their March 2004 levels, having dropped in 20 major U.S. cities by 2.2% in October and by a record 18% from the previous year, according to the Case-Shiller price index published Tuesday by Standard & Poor's.

Prices have fallen in all 20 cities compared with both the prior month and October 2007, and 14 of the 20 metro areas showed record rates of annual declines. Also, 14 of 20 areas sustained declines of more than 10% on a year-over-year basis.

Retreating prices are likely to accelerate in coming months due to lower demand for housing, said Patrick Newport, U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight.

"The main force driving house prices down are foreclosures, which are still rising," Newport wrote in a research note. "The Obama administration and the Fed are working on ways to limit the number of 'preventable foreclosures.' Unfortunately, trial and error will be part of this process."

Prices in cities that are near an equilibrium could still decline because the "number of homes on the market remains high," he added

For Case-Shiller's original 10-city index, prices fell a record 19.1% in the previous 12 months.

The largest price drop for October was seen in Detroit, with a fall of 4.5% amid growing troubles for the Big Three automakers.

For the year, Phoenix chalked up the biggest drop -- 32.7%.

Here's how prices in the other 20 cities performed in the 12 months through October:

Las Vegas, down 31.7%; San Francisco, down 31%; Miami, down 29%; Los Angeles, down 27.9%; San Diego, down 26.7%; Detroit, down 20.4%; Tampa, down 19.8%, Washington, down 18.7%; Minneapolis, down 16.3%; Chicago, down 10.8%; Atlanta, down 10.5%; Seattle, down 10.2%; Portland, down 10.1%; New York, down 7.5%; Cleveland, down 6.2%; Boston, down 6%; Denver, down 5.2%; Charlotte, down 4.4%; and Dallas, down 3%.

Elsewhere Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence hit a record low in December, as worries increased about current business and labor-market conditions. See full story.
