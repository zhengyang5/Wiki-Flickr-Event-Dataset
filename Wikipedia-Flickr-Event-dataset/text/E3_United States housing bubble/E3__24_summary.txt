Sales of previously owned homes in March fell 8.4 percent from February, the group reported.
It was the largest one-month drop since sales plummeted 12.6 percent in January 1989, when the country was in a housing recession.
Lereah said that he originally expected the housing market to recover by this quarter but that he now believes it won't happen until summer.
However, at the current sales pace, it would take 7.3 months to get through that supply, up from 6.8 months in February.
In the South, which includes the Washington region, sales dropped 6.2 percent.
