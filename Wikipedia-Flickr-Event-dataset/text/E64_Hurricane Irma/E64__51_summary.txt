Dozens of personnel from the Environmental Protection Agency worked to secure some of the nation's most contaminated toxic waste sites as Hurricane Irma bore down on Florida.
The Associated Press surveyed six of the 54 Superfund sites in Florida before Irma's arrival, all around Miami in low-lying, flood-prone areas.
There was no apparent work going on at the sites AP visited this past week.
Bowman said Tolliver was a new employee and may not have been familiar with the EPA's hurricane procedures for Superfund sites.
That followed an Aug. 26 report by AP that at least seven Superfund sites in the Houston region had flooded during Hurricane Harvey.
