With Hurricane Irma making its way towards Florida, the Florida International Golden Panthers stated they were planning on moving their game against Alcorn State to another location.
Today FIU announced that they will face the Alcorn State Braves at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.
â€œI want to thank UAB Director of Athletics Mark Ingram, the University of Alabama Birmingham and the Birmingham community for their tremendous help and assistance.
The Alcorn State-FIU game was previously scheduled to be televised by beIN Sports.
Alcorn State is a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference in the Football Championship Subdivision.
