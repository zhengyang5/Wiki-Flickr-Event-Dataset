Lake County Property Appraiser Carey Baker’s office has finally been able to assess the impact of Hurricane Irma to the far-flung community of Astor, tallying damage at $438,546.
The newly released breakdown of damage shows that four structures had major damage totaling $119,240, 10 had minor damage valued at $192,118 and 32 were “affected” by the storm, causing $127,188 in damage.
Meanwhile, Baker’s office released updated damage estimates cross Lake County.
A damage report released nine days after the hurricane found more than $33 million in damage to 2,615 homes across the county and $1.85 million damage to 109 businesses.
Those tallies don’t include one of the hardest-hit areas, the Tavares marina and seaplane base, which incurred an estimated $5 million in damage.
