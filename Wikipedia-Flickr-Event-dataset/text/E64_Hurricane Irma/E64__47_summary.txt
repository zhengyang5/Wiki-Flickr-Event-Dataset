Hurricane Irma is forcing Central Florida attractions — including Walt Disney World’s four theme parks — to close to guests for multiple days, starting this evening.
Saturday’s end-of-night finales at Disney parks, such as “Rivers of Light” show at Animal Kingdom and the “Happily Ever After” fireworks at Magic Kingdom, have also been pulled from the lineup.
Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resort also canceled some events, including Saturday portions of Christian music festivals Night of Joy and Rock the Universe.
Orlando Eye, the observation wheel on International Drive, will be closed today and not reopen until the storm passes, a spokeswoman said.
Universal Orlando Resort visitors can reschedule or seek refunds, a spokesman said.
