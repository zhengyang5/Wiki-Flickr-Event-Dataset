Rick Scott (R) has declared a state of emergency affecting every county in Florida in preparation for Hurricane Irma, which has been upgraded to a category 4 storm.
"Hurricane Irma poses a severe threat to the entire State of Florida, and requires that timely precautions are taken to protect the communities, critical infrastructure, and general welfare of this State," the order states.
"As governor, I am responsible to meet the dangers presented to this state and its people by this emergency."
The National Hurricane Center said Monday that Irma had strengthened to a category 4 storm, with winds reaching 130 mph as the East Coast braces for the hurricane.
