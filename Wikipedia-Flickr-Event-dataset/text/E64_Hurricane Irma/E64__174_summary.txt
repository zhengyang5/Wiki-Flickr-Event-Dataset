Mr Johnson said the UK would be there for Anguilla for "the long term" after the island's "hellish experience".
Mr Johnson visited Anguilla's worst hit areas, before heading to the neighbouring British Virgin Islands.
The former attorney general of Anguilla, Rupert Jones, told the Guardian the Â£32m hurricane relief fund was a "drop in the Caribbean Sea".
The Foreign Office said that more than 1,000 UK military personnel in the region helping with the relief effort, with 200 more arriving the next few days.
Hundreds of UK troops have been sent to the British Virgin Islands and Mr Johnson said more would be joining them.
