A new evacuation plan from the Florida Department of Transportation allows motorists to drive on the shoulders of highways instead of the more complicated process of making all lanes one-way.
Florida’s reversible lane plan was inspired by road-clogging evacuations before Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and Hurricane Floyd in 1999.
One wrong-way collision involving a confused driver would slow or stall evacuation traffic and defeat the purpose of the reverse lanes.
“Fewer people are going to get on the reverse lanes to automatically cut the traffic load in half,” he said.
In 2005, about 3 million Houston evacuees fled Hurricane Rita using the interstate to Dallas that was converted to one-way lanes.
