As of 3.30 p.m. local time, no deaths have been reported on Saba and only a few wounded. There has been a lot of structural damage.

Satel is working hard on restoring telecommunication services to Saba. Local landlines are slowly being restored. Outgoing international calls are reportedly possible. Saba seems not to be able to receive incoming international calls.

After Irma Update:

On behalf of Governor Johnson, I would like to inform you that the crisis team has met again. A damage assessment is underway and teams are cleaning up. The curfew has been lifted. People can start or continue cleaning. We advise you not to remove the shutters or boards on your house as more weather may be coming. We ask all people to go inside after dark. People who need shelter can go to the shelters in The Bottom or Windwardside for this night.

More information about the shelters will follow tomorrow.
