Thanks to Hurricane Irma, the Florida State League will have co-champions in 2017.

The High-A league announced Tuesday that its year-end championship series, set to be played this weekend, has been canceled. Florida Gov. Rick Scott already has declared a state of emergency as the Category 5 storm churns through the Caribbean, and evacuation orders may be issued beginning Wednesday in parts of South Florida.

"Safety is our first concern for our players and staff," FSL president Ken Carson said in a release. "After consulting with the major league clubs of the participating teams, it was unanimously decided this was the proper thing to do."

With the final series called off, the winners of the division series being played Tuesday and Wednesday will be declared co-champions. Tampa (Yankees) and Dunedin (Blue Jays) are facing off in one series and Palm Beach (Cardinals) and Fort Myers (Twins) in the other.
