With powerful Hurricane Irma approaching the continental U.S., the Carolina League has decided to cancel the 2017 Mills Cup Championship Series, as two other MiLB leagues have done.
The winners of the two Division Series will be declared co-champions.
After being delayed a day, both Division Series got underway Thursday.
If a third game is necessary in the South, it would immediately follow Friday's 5:05 Game 2 at Myrtle Beach.
In 1999, Hurricane Floyd forced an evacuation of Myrtle Beach during the Mills Cup finals.
