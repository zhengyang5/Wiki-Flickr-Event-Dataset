After the storm passes, those birds that survive face long-term problems.
In the path of the storm, trees and shrubs lose all their leaves, buds, flowers and fruits.
The Bahamas National Trust notes that its flamingoes, for example, will fly away ahead of a storm and some seabirds on the wing will increase their altitude to try to get above the storm.
Some very brave Whimbrels have even been recorded flying directly into a storm â€“ for example, one named Chinquapin, braved Hurricane Irene in 2011.
Some birds are true survivors, but with such a large and powerful storm as Irma, nowhere is entirely safe.
