Max Winds: Estimated maximum sustained (1 min) surface (10 m) winds to occur along the U. S. coast.
RMW: The radius of maximum winds (primarily for the right front quadrant of the hurricane), if available.
Central pressure values in parentheses indicate that the value is a simple estimation (based upon a wind-pressure relationship), not directly measured or calculated.
The winds indicated here are lower than in HURDAT and are lower than they were over Mexico.
In this case, central pressure is given for the hurricane's point of closest approach.
