Tessa Webber, the Disaster Coordinator on Barbuda, said officials from the Barbuda Council, Police and Fire Departments, Matron at the hospital and the Antigua and Barbuda Red Cross have already met and done the preparatory work required ahead of the storm.
â€œSo far, we are intact and ready if the storm decides to come our way.
