An elongated area of low pressure stretching across north-central Florida continues to produce a large area of disorganized cloudiness and thunderstorms extending from the southwest coast of Florida northeastward into the western Atlantic.

Regardless of tropical cyclone development, the low is expected to cause increasing winds and rough surf along the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas through early next week. Heavy rain is also expected to continue over portions of southern and central Florida during the next day or two. Please refer to products from your local National Weather Service forecast office for more information on this system. * Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent. * Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent. 2.
