An updated prediction released by the National Hurricane Center on Thursday afternoon indicates that as Irma shifts west, metro Atlanta and North Georgia could face harsher conditions early next week.
As the hurricane moves north, it should weaken to a tropical storm and bring winds between 45 and 50 mph to metro Atlanta.
North Georgia should see at least 60 mph winds.
South metro express lanes will remain exclusively northbound to accommodate evacuee traffic, State Road and Tollway Authority spokeswoman Jodi Smith said in a release.
