A Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect for Dominica as Hurricane Irma nears the Leeward Islands and the northern Windward Islands.
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, in this case within 24-36 hours.
The center of Hurricane Irma is projected to move over or just northeast of the northern Leeward Islands by Tuesday into Wednesday.
Showers, which could be moderate to heavy at times, thunderstorms, gusty winds up to tropical storm force and dangerous seas are expected to affect Dominica up to Wednesday.
The next Bulletin on Hurricane Irma will be issued by the Meteorological Service at 8p.m.
