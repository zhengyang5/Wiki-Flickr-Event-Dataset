Hurricane Irma's official death toll in Florida stands at 69, nearly a month after the storm pounded a south-to-north path through the state.
The figure, compiled by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the state Division of Emergency Management from county medical examiners, includes nine deaths in Broward County.
Eight residents of The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills died Sept. 13, days after the center lost its air-conditioning system because of Irma.
Irma is also blamed for eight deaths by drowning, four cases of electrocution and 14 deaths involving carbon monoxide.
