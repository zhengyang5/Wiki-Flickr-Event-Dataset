By Ricardo WellsTribune Staff Reporterrwells@tribunemedia.netPRIME Minister Dr Hubert Minnis today made his final plea to residents across the country ahead of Hurricane Irma, urging people to stay indoors and "heed" all warnings associated with the storm's passage.
Specifically to residents of West End, Grand Bahama - an area prone to severe flooding - Dr Minnis urged them not to delay in moving.
Forecasters initially projected a heavier hit across the cross-section of Grand Bahama, however, newer tracks show that much of Irma's wind and rain will publish the community of West End for an extended period time.
"Please, please move now," Dr Minnis insisted.
He added: "West End is under threat of sea surges and flooding that poses a direct threat to life."
