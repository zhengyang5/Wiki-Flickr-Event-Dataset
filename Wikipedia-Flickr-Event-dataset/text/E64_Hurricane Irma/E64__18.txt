Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) has declared a state of emergency affecting every county in Florida in preparation for Hurricane Irma, which has been upgraded to a category 4 storm.

Scott's order signed Monday notes that the National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will be a "major hurricane located somewhere north of Cuba and south of Andros Island in the Bahamas."

"Hurricane Irma poses a severe threat to the entire State of Florida, and requires that timely precautions are taken to protect the communities, critical infrastructure, and general welfare of this State," the order states.

"As governor, I am responsible to meet the dangers presented to this state and its people by this emergency."

Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell√≥ (D) also declared a state of emergency on Monday ahead of the impending storm.

The National Hurricane Center said Monday that Irma had strengthened to a category 4 storm, with winds reaching 130 mph as the East Coast braces for the hurricane.

It's the second major storm sending authorities in southeast states scrambling.

Last month, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas and brought devastating flooding to the region. President Trump visited affected areas in Houston and in Louisiana on Saturday.

Thousands of people were displaced in the aftermath of the storm, and recovery is still ongoing.
