Waterlogged ceiling tiles and blown-down roof shingles. Downed trees and branches blocking school walkways and parking lots. Standing water inside auditoriums and classrooms.

On some level, every one of Lee County's public schools received damage from Hurricane Irma in September, and the district estimates is could cost $21 million to repair it all.

"That includes roofing repairs, flooring repairs, window repairs, ceiling repairs, school cleanup, debris cleanup, etc.," reports district spokeswoman Lauren Stillwell.

While campus damage reports have yet to be released, check back with The News-Press as this story develops.
