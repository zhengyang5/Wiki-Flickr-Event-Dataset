Hurricane Irma has prompted Orlando Pride and Orlando City B to change their games times.

Central Florida could be impacted by the category five storm during the weekend.

The Pride were scheduled to face the Seattle Reign at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, but the clubs will now face off at 8 p.m. Thursday night at Orlando City Stadium.

It will be part of a doubleheader, with Orlando City B facing off against the Richmond Kickers at 4:30 p.m. at Orlando City Stadium. OCB was originally scheduled to play Thursday night, but its game time was adjusted to add the Pride game.

Tickets to the Pride’s match for Saturday will be honored at Orlando City Stadium gates on Thursday. Fans are invited to stay for both matches. Seating for OCB’s match is general admission, while Pride ticket holders will have access to their purchased seats.

Seattle has been training in Orlando this week ahead of the match and the earlier showdown should not have an adverse impact on the club’s preparation.

With a win, the Pride could clinch the first National Women’s Soccer League playoff spot in club history. Orlando is riding a five-game win streak and is on pace to set an NWSL single season goal-scoring record.
