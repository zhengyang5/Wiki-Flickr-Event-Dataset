'I have no doubts' we'll qualify for FEMA assistance: Former Puerto Rico governor 10:24 AM ET Thu, 7 Sept 2017 | 03:00

Former Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla told CNBC on Thursday more than 1 million residents are without power after damage by Hurricane Irma.

"There are no casualties related to the storm to this point but we have right now more than 6,000 in shelters and I know they're working very hard to renew power and the service to people felt in the northeast part of ... islands," Padilla said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."

Padilla said the reactions by residents to the storm went well. "People reacted in the proper way, they knew it was something serious," he said. "We are so used to this ... we will be prepared."

On Wednesday, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority had warned residents could go without power for as long as six months from damages by Irma.

The Category 5 storm pummeled Caribbean islands, including Barbuda and Anguilla, before approaching Puerto Rico on Wednesday.

The hurricane was on track to reach Florida on Saturday or Sunday, becoming the second major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in as many weeks after Hurricane Harvey.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.

Regarding tourism, Padilla said the impact is hard but the island will survive.
