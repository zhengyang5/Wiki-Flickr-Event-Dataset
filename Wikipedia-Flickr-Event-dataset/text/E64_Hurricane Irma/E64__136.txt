Hurricane Irma's official death toll in Florida stands at 69, nearly a month after the storm pounded a south-to-north path through the state.

But the number released Friday should continue to grow.

The figure, compiled by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the state Division of Emergency Management from county medical examiners, includes nine deaths in Broward County.

The deaths in Broward County are listed as being due to carbon monoxide, chronic pulmonary disease, heat exhaustion tied to chronic alcoholism, a diabetic crisis, a subdural hematoma and two cases each of blunt trauma and cardiovascular disease.

Eight residents of The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills died Sept. 13, days after the center lost its air-conditioning system because of Irma.

Four more died after the sweltering facility was evacuated.

Deaths from Irma have been reported in the following counties: Broward (9), Collier (1), Duval (5), Hardee (2), Hendry (1), Highlands (4), Hillsborough (4), Lake (1), Lee (1), Leon (2), Liberty (1), Manatee (1), Marion (3), Miami-Dade (5), Monroe (6), Nassau (1), Okeechobee (1), Orange (6), Palm Beach (5), Pinellas (2), Polk (3), Seminole (1), St. Lucie (1), Taylor (2) and Volusia (1).

Twenty-three deaths across the state are attributed to a blunt-force injury --- typically involving traffic crashes or injuries that occurred during the storm or while people worked on storm preparation or recovery.

Irma is also blamed for eight deaths by drowning, four cases of electrocution and 14 deaths involving carbon monoxide.
