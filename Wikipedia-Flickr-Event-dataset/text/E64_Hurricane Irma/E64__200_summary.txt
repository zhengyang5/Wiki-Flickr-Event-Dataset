As people rebuild from the damage caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, they should also be aware of the public health risks related to flooding, including diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses.
“What people don’t often realize is that there’s a significant health risk from flooding,” William Powderly, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), told Homeland Preparedness News.
“Historically we have not invested enough in public health in the United States over the last twenty to thirty years so we’re always playing catch up when we have these emergencies,” he said.
“The CDC is our first line of public health defense, so we really can’t afford as a country, in our opinion, to under invest in public health because of the consequences.”Powderly emphasized that widespread disease outbreaks after flooding remain uncommon.
If the public water supply is in any way compromised, bottled water must be used as much as possible, Powderly said.
