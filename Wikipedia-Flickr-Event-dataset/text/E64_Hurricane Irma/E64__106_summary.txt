Hurricane Irma churned across the Atlantic Ocean in September 2017, battering several Caribbean islands before moving on to the Florida Keys and the U.S. mainland.
As the clouds cleared over places like the Virgin Islands, the destruction became obvious even from space.
The views were acquired on August 25 and September 10, 2017, before and after the storm passed.
They are among the few relatively cloud-free satellite images of the area so far.
Irma passed the northernmost Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 6.
