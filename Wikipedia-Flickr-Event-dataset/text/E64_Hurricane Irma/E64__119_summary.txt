Northwest farmers, left to fend for themselves, struggled to rebuild, replanting banana, avocado and yam crops to make ends meet.
Charite Louis, an agronomist who works for Haiti’s food security unit, said he suspects at least 30,000 people will be in need of rapid assistance.
As recently as February, the food insecurity unit classified the northwest as being in an economic and food security crisis.
“Whatever the crisis, whatever the shock, whatever the [strength] of the hurricane, it will have an impact,” Nabot said.
“If not a major or visual one like St. Maarten, it will have an impact on their economic security, that’s for sure.”
