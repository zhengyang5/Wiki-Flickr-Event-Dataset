Guests and staff are updated in real time, as a result of Atlantis’ official Hurricane Preparedness Plan.
Six visitors to Harbour Island were due to leave yesterday, while another six in Abaco, 25 in Exuma and 10 in the Berry Islands will remain.
“For example, in Exuma, Sandals is committed to ensure the well-being of any guests who remain on their property.
“We’re implementing our company’s emergency response plan, and ensuring we certainly take care of our guests and ensure their safety, and then our associates.”
