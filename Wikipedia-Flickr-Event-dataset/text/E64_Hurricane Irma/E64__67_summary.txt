The University of Maine’s Sept. 30 football game at the University of Central Florida in Orlando has been canceled to allow the Knights to play an American Athletic Conference game against Memphis.
Central Florida’s game against Memphis was postponed last weekend because of Hurricane Irma and needed to be rescheduled.
Central Florida is a Football Bowl Subdivision team that traditionally pays smaller Football Championship Subdivision schools like Maine to play a home game.
Central Florida has also postponed a second game this Saturday against Georgia Tech.
But we certainly can understand the situation that Central Florida is in.”One possibility is Georgia State, which had its Sept. 30 nonconference game against Memphis canceled.
