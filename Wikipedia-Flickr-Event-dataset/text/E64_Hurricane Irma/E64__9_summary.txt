ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM Hurricane Irma Discussion Number 12 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL AL112017 500 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2017 Irma appears to have weakened a little during the last several hours.
It is interesting to note that a ship (BATFR17) passed within 50 n mi to the west of the center of Irma and has only reported winds of about 40 kt, indicating that the core of Irma is compact.
These more favorable conditions combined with low to moderate wind shear should allow the hurricane to strengthen.
Irma is expected to be a major hurricane when it moves closer to the Lesser Antilles early next week, producing rough surf and rip currents.
It is much too early to determine what direct impacts Irma will have on the continental United States.
