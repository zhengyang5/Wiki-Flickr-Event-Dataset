The ship has been deployed in the Caribbean since July in preparation for the hurricane season, ready to provide support at a moment’s notice.
Tasked by the Royal Navy, she was the UK’s first military response to the Caribbean.
Also on board are the Royal Navy’s Mobile Aviation Support Force – aviation specialists, meteorological advisors and flight deck crews.
RFA Mounts Bay is now making for the British Virgin Islands - 90 miles to the west - to concentrate today’s disaster relief efforts.
Meanwhile, three flights will shortly be departing RAF Brize Norton carrying Royal Marines, Engineers, medical supplies and aid including emergency shelter kits, rations and clean water.
