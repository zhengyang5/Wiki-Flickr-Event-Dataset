VILANO BEACH, Fla. -- Hurricane Irma left many homes torn apart along Vilano Beach in St. John's County where the erosion was already severe from Hurricane Matthew and years of powerful waves.
Senator Marco Rubio, checked out the damage for themselves Tuesday as Building Department officials surveyed the damage.
The walls he referenced worked to protect some homes nearby, but only a handful of houses along Vilano Beach have chosen to build a type of barrier.
They had to block off parts of the beach where decks and 4x4s were left dangling with nothing to hold them up anymore.
They ask residents to be patient and for visitors to the beach to steer clear of the homes as they could still fall with the worsening erosion.
