More than three weeks after Hurricane Irma swept through Central Florida, residents living in low-lying areas are still dealing with rising waters from the powerful storm.
Flooding woes continue in neighborhoods ranging from areas near Lake Harney in east Seminole County to the remote community of Astor in northeast Lake County.
“It’s static; it hasn’t really moved,” Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Mike Ertel, who lives off Whitcomb Drive along the southwestern shore of Lake Harney, said Tuesday.
Astor resident Nancy Brand, 74, said water that poured over the seawall of her canal when Irma hit still laps up to her back porch.
Likewise, Julie Atwell and her family, who live along the Lake Harney shore, canoed to their home after Irma’s rains flooded their property and garage.
