A team of NOAA aviators have been taking aerial imagery of locations affected by Hurricane Irma.
The images are a crucial tool in determining the extent of the damage inflicted by storms and flooding.
Once the aviators shoot the imagery, it is posted online for the public to access.
In addition, imagery is used for ongoing research efforts to test and develop new airborne digital imaging standards.
