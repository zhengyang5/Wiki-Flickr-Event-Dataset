Although the Category Five storm did not pass directly over Haiti, the edge of Irma still caused flooding and mudslides in the northern part of the country.
At least one casualty was reported, and it's estimated that 5000 houses were flooded by Irma with potentially as many as 30,000 affected by the disaster.
Category Five is the highest grade on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and indicates a storm that could cause catastrophic damage.
Irma also destroyed an important bridge which connects Haiti with the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
