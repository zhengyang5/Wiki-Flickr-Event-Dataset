People in the Dominican Republic and Haiti are facing “the day after” Hurricane Irma, which caused widespread damage overnight.
Oxfam teams will immediately asses the needs of the most vulnerable people in the heaviest-hit areas, mainly in the north of both countries.
Thousands of houses have been damaged in the Dominican Republic and people displaced.
Oxfam teams in Cap Haitien, Ouanaminthe and Gonaive, in the northern part of the country, have the necessary stock for cholera prevention.
Oxfam is continuing to monitor the progress of Hurricane Jose following behind, which threatens more damage including to islands already wrecked by Irma.
