COLUMBIA, S.C. -- While South Carolina avoided Irma's eye, the massive storm caused severe flooding and tropical storm-force winds that left hundreds of thousands without power Monday.
At least seven people had to be rescued in Edisto Beach, a town under evacuation orders about 30 miles down the coast from Charleston.
A family of four "decided all of a sudden they'd leave," Edisto Beach Mayor Jane Darby told the Associated Press.
McMaster's order late Friday required people on seven barrier islands, plus Edisto Beach, to begin evacuating Saturday morning.
A massive oak tree fell Monday on a two-story apartment building he owns in Columbia by the University of South Carolina.
