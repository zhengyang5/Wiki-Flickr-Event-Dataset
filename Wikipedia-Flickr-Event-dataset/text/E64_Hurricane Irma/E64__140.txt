The death toll from Hurricane Irma has risen to 22 as the storm continues its destructive path through the Caribbean.

The dead include 11 on St. Martin and St. Barts, four in the U.S. Virgin Islands and four in the British Virgin Islands. There was also one each in Barbuda, Anguilla, and Barbados.

In addition to those 22 deaths, the first storm-related death in the continental U.S. was reported Friday.



Around 10 a.m., a 57-year-old Davie man was installing hurricane shutters on the second floor of a home in the Poiciana development on 136th Avenue and State Road 84 when he fell off the ladder and hit his head on the pool deck.

He was transported to Broward Health Center, where he eventually succumbed to his injuries.

The storm is expected to make landfall in Florida by Sunday morning.



The toll in the Caribbean is expected to rise as rescuers reach some of the hardest-hit areas.

Irma weakened from a Category 5 to a still-fearsome Category 4 on Friday morning with winds of 155 mph (250 kph) as it churns along Cuba's northern coast.

Officials are concerned that Category 4 Hurricane Jose is also looming south of the Caribbean.



"I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to know that further damage is imminent," said Inspector Frankie Thomas of the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda.
