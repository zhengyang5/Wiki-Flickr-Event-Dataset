JOHN’S, Antigua and Barbuda – 8th September, 2017……The first of three Amerijet Cargo planes, with over 120, 000 pounds of hurricane relief for Barbuda arrived on Antigua on Friday from Miami.
“With the kind assistance of our partners and Amerijet, we secured the items in two days from Atlanta; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Arizona; and the Mid-West of the United States, as no hurricane relief items were available in Miami due to the pending arrival of Hurricane Irma,” Boustany noted.
“The other two planes will arrive in Antigua next week and will carry over 145, 000 pounds each of similar items for the relief effort of persons from the sister island which was devastated by Hurricane Irma.
“We are thankful that Ambassador Boustany was able to mobilize so quickly and get these much-needed items into Antigua.
A warehouse has also been secured in Miami for the receipt and storage of items for the Barbuda Hurricane Relief effort.
