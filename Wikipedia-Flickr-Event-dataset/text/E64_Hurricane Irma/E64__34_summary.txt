The foreign affairs ministry yesterday said that it is still trying to determine the extent of the loss of lives, injury and damage as category five Hurricane Irma continues its rampage through the Caribbean.
There are reports that the infrastructure in Barbuda was all but obliterated when Irma hit the tiny island on Wednesday.
Notwithstanding these difficulties, we continue to pay close attention to official reports and to explore different avenues to try to reach [Caribbean] community members.
Meanwhile, French, British and Dutch military authorities yesterday rushed aid to the devastated string of Caribbean islands as Hurricane Irma spun toward Florida for what could be a catastrophic blow this weekend.
Officials said 11,200 people in all had evacuated vulnerable areas, while 55,000 soldiers had been deployed to help the clean-up.
