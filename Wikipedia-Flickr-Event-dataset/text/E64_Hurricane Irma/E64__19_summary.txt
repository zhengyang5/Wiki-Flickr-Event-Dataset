The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed $7.9 billion in Harvey disaster relief as warring Republicans and Democrats united to help victims of that storm in Texas and Louisiana.
The storm's wrath could end up exceeding the $110 billion federal cost of recovery from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
"We're not going to let money get in the way of saving lives," FEMA administrator Brock Long said Wednesday on "CBS This Morning."
So far, FEMA has approved $148 million in aid for more than 180,000 survivors of Harvey, finding more than 50,000 hotel and motel rooms for survivors.
"I won't forget Harvey," Bossert said, as he rushed to join a phone call between Trump and Florida Gov.
