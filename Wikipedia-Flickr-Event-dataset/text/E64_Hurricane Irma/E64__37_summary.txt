Haiti appeared to have escaped the worst of Hurricane Irma as it barreled across its northern coastline Thursday, but authorities cautioned that the vulnerable nation remains in a danger zone.
Earlier in the day as the storm approached Haiti, Pierre and several other mayors said they were forced to dip into their meager coffers to stock shelters.
“We don’t have any equipment.”Christian Joseph, the mayor of Môle-Saint-Nicolas, a city on Haiti’s northwestern tip, amplified Alusma’s concerns.
Like Joseph, Pierre said, she had to use what she had in her own meager coffers.
Pierre also said she had not yet received any food supplies, or noticed any pre-positioned equipment in the region.
