As Hurricane Irma ripped through the Caribbean and the Bahamas this week, it caused immense damage and destruction to homes, businesses and infrastructure on the islands.
It also sucked away ocean water from the shoreline at some beaches in the Bahamas.
Over the weekend, several Twitter users posted videos and photos of what was left after the water seemingly disappeared during Hurricane Irma.
“I am in disbelief right now…This is Long Island, Bahamas and the ocean water is missing!!
Hurricane Irma passed through the Bahamas on Friday and struck other Carribean islands late last week.
