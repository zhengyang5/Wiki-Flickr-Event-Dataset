ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM Hurricane Irma Discussion Number 17 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL AL112017 1100 AM AST Sun Sep 03 2017 The eye of Irma is a little less distinct in geostationary satellite images this morning, which suggests that the intensity of the hurricane may be fluctuating yet again.
The first reconnaissance mission, a NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hurricane aircraft, is scheduled to depart Barbados for tail Doppler radar mission into Irma late this afternoon and should provide additional information on Irma's intensity by this evening.
Residents in these areas should monitor the progress of Irma and listen to advice given by officials.
Direct impacts from Irma are also possible in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later this week, and tropical storm or hurricane watches could be issued for these islands by tomorrow.
It is too early to determine what direct impacts Irma might have on the continental United States.
