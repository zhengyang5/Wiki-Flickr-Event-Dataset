FLORIDA CITY, Fla. - Dozens of people begun heading out on the roads early Monday, hoping to make their way back to the Florida Keys after evacuating for Hurricane Irma.
Drivers were confronted by a roadblock in Florida City as they were hoping to jump on U.S. Route 1 or Card Sound Road to get into the Keys.
The roadblock was set up by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office and Florida Highway Patrol, which shut down all access to the Keys.
And we'll go from there," Florida National Guard Capt.
