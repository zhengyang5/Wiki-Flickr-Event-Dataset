BATON ROUGE -- Most models have Hurricane Irma heading toward Florida or up the East Coast, but New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu isn't taking any chances.
It doesn’t appear that’s going to happen, but because of how these storms move, you have to be prepared."
Tuesday, Landrieu joined Governor John Bel Edwards and emergency officials from across south Louisiana to discuss hurricane evacuation with Irma's projected path taking it dangerously close to the Gulf of Mexico.
"What’s difficult about this storm is that it’s going to turn, but if it doesn’t turn, it doesn’t give us a lot of time," Landrieu said.
South Texas to the west is still reeling from Hurricane Harvey and is out of play as a potential evacuation destination.
