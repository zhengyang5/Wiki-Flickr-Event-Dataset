Usually offering a paradise getaway for sun-seeking tourists, footage from the island shows flooded roads and broken structures.
Despite being first hit by the 185mph winds and category 5 hurricane, rain and powerful winds continue to batter the already shattered island.
Irma also slammed into the Caribbean island of St Bart√©lemy and the larger island of Guadeloupe.
It said the government headquarters in Saint Martin have been partially destroyed and the island is in a total blackout.
