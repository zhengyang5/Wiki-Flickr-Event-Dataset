Here are a few tips to help you:

1. Prepare an emergency plan and discuss this plan with your family and employees.

Develop an Emergency Communication Plan – Determine a strategy with your family as to how you will contact each other in the event of separation from one another during a disaster. Have a Survival/Emergency Kit. Know the location of your emergency shelter and determine the best routes to reach that shelter. Check into your home and auto insurance policies – Confirm that policies are valid and that coverage is appropriate. Make arrangements for pets and livestock.
