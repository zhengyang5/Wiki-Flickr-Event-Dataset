Hurricane Irma is the first storm on record to maintain its Category 5 rating for such a long amount of time, the French weather service has said.
The record comes after the storm sustained maximum wind speeds of 185 miles per hour, becoming the only Atlantic hurricane to sustain such powerful wind speeds for so long.
The last hurricane is maintain such winds for even close to that long was hurricane Allen, which hit northern Mexico and southern Texas in 1980.
Allen had winds of 180 mph and above for around 18 hours.
