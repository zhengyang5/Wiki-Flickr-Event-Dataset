The measure approved Thursday would continue government funding through Dec. 8 and extend the debt limit for the same period.
“What we’re doing in this body today is not draining the swamp,” said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, who voted no.
Before approving the legislation, the Senate rejected a proposal by Mr. Sasse to pass only the hurricane relief measure that had sailed through the House, without the debt limit or stopgap spending measure as part of it.
Still, conservatives unhappy about how the debt limit is being handled will have to decide whether that matter justifies a “no” vote on a measure providing billions of dollars in hurricane relief.
“I want the Senate to be forewarned that this $15 billion package, this is only temporary,” said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida.
