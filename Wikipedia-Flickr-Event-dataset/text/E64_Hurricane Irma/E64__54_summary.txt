(Sept. 10, 2017) Hurricane Irma has strengthened as it heads toward Florida's Gulf Coast.
While Irma raked Florida's Gulf Coast, forecasters warned that the entire state was in danger because of the sheer size of the storm.
Along the Gulf Coast, two manatees became stranded after Hurricane Irma sucked the water out of Sarasota Bay, in Florida's Manatee County.
For days, forecasters had warned Irma was taking dead aim at the Miami area and the rest of the state's Atlantic coast.
