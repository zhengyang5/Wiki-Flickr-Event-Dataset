MIAMI (Reuters) - About 1.5 million homes and businesses in Florida and Georgia remained without power on Friday after Hurricane Irma, including 46 of Florida’s nearly 700 nursing homes caught in the deadly storm’s path.

Florida Power & Light, owned by NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N) and the state’s biggest electric company, said it was working aggressively to restore power to the 23 percent of its customers still in the dark.
A timeline of events issued by the nursing home shows administrators repeatedly called Florida Power & Light and state officials after a transformer powering its air conditioning system went out during the storm on Sunday.
In its status reports, the center indicated that its cooling system was operational for much of the time, according to the state.
