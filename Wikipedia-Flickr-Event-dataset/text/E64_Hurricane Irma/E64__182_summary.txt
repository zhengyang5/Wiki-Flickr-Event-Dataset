Hurricane Irma has caused "huge damage" to St. Martin, devastating its airport and port and leaving the Dutch part of the Caribbean island unreachable, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Thursday.
French authorities say at least eight lives have been lost on the French side of St. Martin.
After holding crisis talks with his top cabinet ministers, Rutte confirmed "there is no power" on St. Martin and the island's "infrastructure is badly damaged."
Images shot by a Dutch naval helicopter over St. Martin revealed the extent of Irma's trail of destruction.
"Our highest priority is to restore public amenities," naval Lieutenant Egbert Stoel told Dutch television RTL from Cura√ßao.
