In the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, Florida is beginning to assess some of the major damage the storm did to the state's farmlands and agriculture industry.
Florida produces almost half of all citrus crops in the U.S. and is the second-largest orange juice producer in the world.
Early estimates say the storm could cause more than $1 billion worth of damage to crops.
Hendry County, which has the most citrus trees in the state, says the storm cost it 60 percent of its orange crop.
The state was already dealing with a drop in citrus production due to an incurable disease affecting its trees.
