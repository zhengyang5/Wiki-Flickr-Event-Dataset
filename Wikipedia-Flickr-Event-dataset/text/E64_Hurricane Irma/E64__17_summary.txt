ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM Tropical Storm Irma Discussion Number 50 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL AL112017 1100 AM EDT Mon Sep 11 2017 Irma continues to weaken while moving over extreme northern Florida with most of the deep convection displaced well to the north and northeast of the center due to strong shear.
The current intensity is set at 55 kt which is in line with the highest sustained winds seen in surface observations.
Shortly thereafter Irma will likely become a remnant low, with complete dissipation by 72 hours as shown by the dynamical guidance.
Irma or its remnant should continue to move along the eastern and northeastern periphery of a broad mid-level cyclonic circulation until dissipation.
There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge flooding along portions of the coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, where a Storm Surge Warning remains in effect.
