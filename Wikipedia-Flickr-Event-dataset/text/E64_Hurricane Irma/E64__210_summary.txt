Irma is now an “extremely dangerous” Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds up to 185 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center.
That makes it the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.

“These rainfall amounts may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,” the National Hurricane Center said.
Because of how strong Irma has become, “preparations should be rushed to completion in the hurricane warning area,” forecasters at the hurricane center said.
