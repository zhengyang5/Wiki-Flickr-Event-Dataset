And of that, just $541 million was "immediately available" for response and recovery efforts related to Hurricane Harvey, according to a spokeswoman for FEMA who asked not to be identified by name.
The agency would be out of funds just as Irma, a category 5 hurricane, might start thrashing the coast of Florida.
In the meantime, FEMA has restricted spending to what it calls "immediate needs" -- what it calls "lifesaving, life-sustaining response efforts" for Harvey and Irma.
But without more money, Zimmerman said, the agency will be hard-pressed to deal with whatâ€™s coming.
Irma comes after Hurricane Harvey, which smashed ashore in Texas Aug. 25 causing widespread damage, power outages and flooding and taking almost a fifth of U.S. oil refining capacity offline.
