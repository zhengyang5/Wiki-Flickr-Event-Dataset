Although residents and business owners have been allowed to re-enter the upper Florida Keys following Hurricane Irma, access to the lower keys remains restricted south of Mile Marker 73.
Thanks to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, aerial views of much of the Florida Keys are available.
Boats tossed from the City of Marathon Marina sit in mangroves following Hurricane Irma as seen from the NOAA satellite imagery website.
The entire length of the Keys, with some exceptions such as uninhabited areas, are now included in the imagery.
