Lake County Property Appraiser Carey Baker’s office has finally been able to assess the impact of Hurricane Irma to the far-flung community of Astor, tallying damage at $438,546.

Astor, an isolated hamlet in northeast Lake County, was not included in original estimates of countywide Irma damage because of flooding that persisted for weeks after the hurricane swept through Central Florida on Sept. 11.

The St. Johns crested 4.3 feet above flood-stage levels in Irma’s aftermath, the National Weather Service says. As a result, some homes in low-lying Astor were swamped by floodwaters.

The newly released breakdown of damage shows that four structures had major damage totaling $119,240, 10 had minor damage valued at $192,118 and 32 were “affected” by the storm, causing $127,188 in damage.

Irma also caused losses to businesses that were hampered by the flooding, but things are getting back to normal.

“Our community is welcoming visitors once again. Our river is open to boaters!!!” says the Astor Area Chamber of Commerce’s website. “Our restaurants are all in full service and welcome your business at this time.”

Hoping to help jump-start businesses stymied by the storm, county commissioners in November OK’d a grant program that provides Astor businesses tied to tourism as much as $6,000 for marketing and advertising to let people know they’re back in business.

Meanwhile, Baker’s office released updated damage estimates cross Lake County.

A damage report released nine days after the hurricane found more than $33 million in damage to 2,615 homes across the county and $1.85 million damage to 109 businesses.

The updated report shows a higher number of residents harmed, 2,999, with damage totaling $36,969,770. It found the number of commercial businesses damaged rose to 112 with damage going up to $2,156,037.

Those tallies don’t include one of the hardest-hit areas, the Tavares marina and seaplane base, which incurred an estimated $5 million in damage. The city wasted little time in moving forward with plans to replace the facilities, which are crucial to the city living up to its billing as “America’s Seaplane City.”

Requests for qualifications for parties interested in designing and rebuilding the marina and seaplane base are due by Jan. 18. The city is requiring “that appropriate planning is included in the design to ensure that future weather events do not result in significant damage.”
