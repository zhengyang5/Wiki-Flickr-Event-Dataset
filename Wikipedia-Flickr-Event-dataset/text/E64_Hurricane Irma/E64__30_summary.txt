Hurricane Irma doesn’t have to be a disaster says TCI's Disaster Management director Virginia Clerveaux H urricanes like Irma which currently poses a serious threat to the Turks and Caicos Islands don’t have to be disasters, they are simply hazards, said Dr. Virginia Clerveaux, Director of the Department of Disaster Management and Emergencies (DDME).
“It’s a lack of preparedness by residents and other entities that make [hurricanes] a disaster," Clerveaux said at a press conference held on Monday, September 4th, 2017 at the Premier’s Office in Providenciales.
Delroy Williams, added that it would be the righter bands of the hurricane which would primarily affect the country.
In terms of rainfall, we’re expecting maximum amount of rainfall throughout the Turks and Caicos Islands.
We just need to ensure now that residents of the Turks and Caicos Islands do their part,” she continued.
