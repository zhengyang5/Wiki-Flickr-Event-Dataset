WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment fell in September for the first time in seven years as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left displaced workers temporarily unemployed and delayed hiring, the latest indication that the storms undercut economic activity in the third quarter.
The department said Harvey and Irma, which wreaked havoc in Texas and Florida in late August and early September, reduced employment last month.
The unemployment rate hit a more than 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent and annual wage growth accelerated to 2.9 percent.
Harvey and Irma did not have an impact on the unemployment rate, which fell two-tenths of a percentage point from August to the lowest since February 2001.
The unemployment rate is now below the Federal Reserveâ€™s median average forecast for the fourth quarter.
