The Hurricane Center had hoisted hurricane warnings for much of South and Central Florida on both coasts, reaching north of Tampa and Melbourne.
“This hurricane is as serious as any I have seen,” tweeted Eric Blake, a forecaster at the Hurricane Center.
“All areas seeing heavy rainfall from Irma will experience a risk of flooding and flash flooding,” the Hurricane Center said.
Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, toured the extensive damage caused by Hurricane Irma on Sept. 6.
It is tied for second-most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane.
