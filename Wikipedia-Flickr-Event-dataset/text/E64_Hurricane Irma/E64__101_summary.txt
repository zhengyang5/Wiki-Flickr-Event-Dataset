Hurricane Irma smashed through the Leeward Islands in the early morning hours of September 6, 2017, as a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane with 185 mph winds.
Serge Brin’s personal weather station (PWS) on St. Barts (ISAINTBA3), after Hurricane Irma had severed the 21-foot pole housing the anemometer.
Before failing, the station measured the highest wind gust ever recorded by a PWS on the Weather Underground network: 199 mph (320.3 kph).
Third place is a 211 mph gust in Cuba during Hurricane Gustav in 2008, and the fourth highest wind gust on record was the 207 mph gust measured in Greenland at Thule Air Force Base on March 6, 1972.
