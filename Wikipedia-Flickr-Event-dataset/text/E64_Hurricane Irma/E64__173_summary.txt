The UK’s response to Irma, which devastated the British overseas territories of the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla, has been found wanting, according to two influential MPs.
Yesterday the government sought to hit back by revealing more about the £32m aid package that will be delivered to the British overseas territories in the Caribbean.
Meanwhile, the National Police Chiefs’ Council confirmed that officers would provide support to the British Virgin Islands force as part of the relief effort.
The officers will support the British Virgin Islands police force to maintain law and order, as well as help find missing people, including any British nationals.
However, the British response has been contrasted with that of France, whose overseas island territories of Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy have also been hit hard.
