As Hurricane Irma closes in, the state is opening the left shoulder of Interstate 4 from Tampa to Orlando to assist traffic fleeing the west coast of Florida.
Only the left shoulder is open to motorists where FHP troopers, police and highway signs indicate.
This is the second time in as many days that Hurricane Irma caused the shoulder of a highway to be used for evacuations.
The left shoulder of northbound I-75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line was temporarily opened up to evacuees Friday to relieve congestion.
