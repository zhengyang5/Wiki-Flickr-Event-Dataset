ATLANTA -- Tropical Storm Irma killed two people in Georgia as storm surge and rain flooded coastal communities Monday, winds sent trees crashing onto homes and the world's busiest airport in Atlanta canceled hundreds of flights as the storm's punch was felt statewide despite its weakened status as a tropical storm.
Tropical storm winds reached more than 400 miles from its center, giving its powerful gusts and drenching rains a far reach.
Almost all of Georgia was under a tropical storm warning.
By Monday afternoon, more than 800,000 Georgia Power and EMC customers mostly in coastal and south Georgia were without power.
Georgia Power spokeswoman Holly Crawford said Monday the areas with the most power outages were coastal Glynn and Chatham counties.
