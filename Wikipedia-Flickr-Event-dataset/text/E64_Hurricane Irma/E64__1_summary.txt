Irma, which hit Florida as a category four hurricane on Sunday, has since been downgraded to a tropical storm.
The storm is likely to have the biggest long-term economic impact in the Caribbean, experts said.
Enki predicts the economic impact could be about $50bn - well below the roughly $200bn the firm predicted early in the storm.
But some small Caribbean islands are looking at damage from Hurricane Irma that is many times higher than their annual GDP.
