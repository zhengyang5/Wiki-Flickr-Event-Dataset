ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM Tropical Storm Irma Discussion Number 2 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL AL112017 500 PM AST Wed Aug 30 2017 Irma is displaying increasingly organized symmetric and interlocking rainbands with a well-defined outflow as seen in the visible and infrared satellite imagery this afternoon.
Irma is embedded within very low tropospheric vertical shear currently and for the foreseeable future, as the tropical storm lies underneath the upper-level anticyclone.
However, in about three days the SSTs and the mid-level humidities that Irma should start to encounter will become cooler and drier.
The official intensity forecast is closest to the ICON consensus technique through three days, then shows no change to day five.
Irma is moving toward the west at about 13 kt along the south side of the deep-layer Azores high.
