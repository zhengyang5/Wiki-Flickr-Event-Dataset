A former Nashville family is pleading for help for St. John residents who have been devastated by Hurricane Irma.
Robert Gonzales worked in Nashville as a lawyer for 20 years, and Brittany worked at a Nashville nonprofit for five years before settling at St. John.
“We are Americans and we need help,” Brittany said in an emotional phone interview.
Robert is staying to help friends and neighbors.
We need help now, and we need the government to step up and come and help us."
