“A group went to complain to their RE teacher saying it was Islamophobic,” a source said.
Two community leaders also reported Abedi over his extremist views in 2015, fearing he was already involved in terror networks.
Four days later, he detonated a suicide bomb in the foyer of Manchester Arena as thousands of young Ariana Grande fans streamed out of a concert, killing seven people.
