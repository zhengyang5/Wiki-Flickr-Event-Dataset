Hashem Abedi, 20, was arrested in Libya shortly after his older brother, Salman Abedi, blew himself up, killing 22 concertgoers at the Manchester Arena on 22 May this year.
The extradition request had been made to the “internationally recognised” government in Tripoli, he added.
Jackson said that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, had agreed to the extradition request being made.
Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, said: “I have consistently said it is imperative that any trial related to the Manchester Arena attack takes place in the UK.
Some 353 people were in the foyer of the concert venue when Salman Abedi detonated his rucksack bomb.
