Jeremy Corbyn attended the huge public vigil in Manchester last night as the city gathered to remember the 22 people killed in Monday’s terror attack.
The gathering was held hours before Theresa May raised the terror threat level to “critical”, the highest band.
Yesterday Corbyn recorded a video message saying Britain was “united in sympathy” for the victims of an “horrific atrocity”.
“Our hearts are broken but our resolve has never been stronger,” he said.
“We are determined that the poison of terror will not be allowed to pollute our democratic politics.
