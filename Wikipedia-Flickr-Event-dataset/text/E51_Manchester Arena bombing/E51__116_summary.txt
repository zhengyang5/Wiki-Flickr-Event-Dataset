A report by Lord Kerslake found poor communication meant chief fire officers were "risk-averse" and kept emergency trained responders away.
The fire service and the control room "felt they had let down the people of Greater Manchester" on the night of the blast, Lord Kerslake's report said.
Lord Kerslake said that "deep down" the errors were prompted by failings in "operational culture".
Lord Kerslake said: "A number were reduced to a frantic search around the hospitals of Greater Manchester to find out more."
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service's interim chief fire officer Dawn Docx apologised "unreservedly" for her service's failures.
