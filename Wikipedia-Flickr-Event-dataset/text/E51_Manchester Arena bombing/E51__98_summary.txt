Manchester Mayor: Bomber Was A Terrorist, Not A MuslimAndy Burnham insisted people should not turn on the Muslim community in the aftermath of the Manchester terror attack.
But the Mayor of Manchester insisted that this man was a terrorist who had noting to do with Islam.
"He does not represent the Muslim community.
"The worst thing that can happen is that people use this to blame an entire community, the Muslim community.
"In my view, the man who committed this atrocity no more represents the Muslim community than the individual who murdered my friend Jo Cox represents the white, Christian community."
