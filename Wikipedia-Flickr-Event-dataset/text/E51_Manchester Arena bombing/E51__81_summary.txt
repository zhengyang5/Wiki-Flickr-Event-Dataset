London (CNN) Hours before he set off a bomb believed to be hidden in a backpack , Manchester Arena suicide attacker Salman Abedi walked city streets toting a bright blue suitcase.
This image of Salman Abedi with a suitcase was taken on the day of the concert attack.
When CNN asked the Home Office for a response to reports the FBI warned MI5 about Abedi, a spokesman declined to comment.
A British counterterrorism official told CNN it was not clear whether Abedi received training with ISIS in Syria.
On Thursday, a US official told CNN the bomber likely received some ISIS training by traveling to Syria in the months before the attack.
