French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb talks to journalists on May 20, 2017 | Philippe Desmazes/ AFP via Getty Images French interior minister: Salman Abedi had ‘proven’ links with Islamic State Abedi had gone to Libya, and ‘probably’ to Syria as well, the minister said.
Salman Abedi, the man suspected of carrying out the Manchester suicide bombing, had traveled to Libya and “probably” Syria and had links with Islamic State, French Interior Minister Gérard Collomb said Wednesday.
Collomb appeared on BFMTV to discuss French President Emmanuel Macron’s move to extend France’s state of emergency, imposed in response to the 2015 Paris attacks, until November 1.
The decision to seek parliament approval for the extension followed a defense council gathering top security officials during which the Manchester bombing was discussed, Macron’s office said in a statement.
Macron also ordered his staff to set up by June 7 a special unit devoted to coordinating intelligence operations against terrorism, which was one of his campaign vows.
