The Prime Minister has set out her plans for a "Commission for Countering Extremism" in the wake of the Manchester terror attack.
Theresa May said that, as well as governments intervening to tackle extremism if it turns criminal, people can do more to stand up for British values, where Islamist extremism undermines them.
"Extremism, especially Islamist extremism, strips some people of the freedoms they should enjoy, undermines the cohesion of our society, and can fuel violence.
The Commission for Countering Extremism is mentioned in the Conservativesâ€™ election manifesto, which was launched four days before the attack in Manchester on Monday night.
The commission would be established as a statutory body, legally compelled to identify extremism in communities where it threatens to undermine British values.
