Salah Suhbi, an MP in Libya who grew up in Sheffield, said Libyans in Manchester had been warning about terrorist recruiters operating openly in the city.
“Manchester has the biggest community of Libyans in Britain and they know exactly what’s happening, there’s a recruitment policy, we’ve been warning about it for years,” he said.
“People have been talking about this for the past three or four years, how ruthless they [the Islamist recruiters] are.
Suhbi said the vast majority are horrified by the Manchester killings, adding: “We are really upset this is happening in the UK.
“What happened in Manchester is tragic on so many levels, the Libyan community in the city is in deep sadness and shock.”He said many Libyans in the UK fear that the spreading of Isis ideology in Libya may expand to Britain.
