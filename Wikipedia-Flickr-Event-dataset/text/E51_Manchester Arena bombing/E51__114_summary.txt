Ariana Grandeâ€˜s star-studded Manchester benefit concert filled with messages of love and resilience raised more than $13 million for the victims of the May 22 attack.
About 50,000 fans gathered in an act of defiance and strength for the sold-out One Love Manchester concert on Sunday.
The British Red Cross said it raised 10 million pounds, which is about $13 million, for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund, the Associated Press reports.
Grande organized the concert in the 13 days after a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured many others outside of her concert at Manchester Arena.
She also offered 14,000 free tickets for the benefit concert for those who attended her May 22 concert.
