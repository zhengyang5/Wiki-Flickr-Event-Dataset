The former Labour MP admitted the city is "grieving" today over the horrifying attack on teenage fans at an Ariana Grande concert in the Manchester Arena.
He offered his support to the families of the victims, and paid tribute to locals who had opened their doors to strangers and offered shelter to those fleeing the Manchester Arena and evacuated areas.
The mayor said this was the "best possible message to those who seek to divide us", and would be the prevailing spirit of Manchester.
Lucy Powell, Manchester Central's Labour candidate and the MP before the election, said the city would "come together and unite in solidarity".
