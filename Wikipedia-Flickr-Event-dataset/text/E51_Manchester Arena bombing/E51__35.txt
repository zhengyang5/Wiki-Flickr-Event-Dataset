I’ve heard lots of stories about how the broader Manchester community has opened up – free taxi rides, offers of accommodation, all the things that a good community will do to try and support in what is going to be the worst possible moment in their lives.

I think that has to be part of the story. It is a tragedy, the loss of life is truly appalling, but as a city, as a community, we will continue to pull together, and we will not allow ourselves to be beaten.

We don’t know what the cause is yet. Clearly there is lots of supposition taking place. But this is not something that we are going to allow to beat us as a Manchester community.
