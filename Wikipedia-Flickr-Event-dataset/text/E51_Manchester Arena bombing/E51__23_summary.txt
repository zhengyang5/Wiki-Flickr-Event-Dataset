ISIS has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, northern England, on Monday evening — but U.S. authorities have not yet verified the claim.
According to the Daily Telegraph, one video showed an English-speaking ISIS supporter holding up a sign reading ‘Manchester’ with the date of the attack.
Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, told Congress that the extremist group frequently claims responsibility for terror attacks, the Associated Press reports.
An daily rundown of military activities released by the group earlier on Tuesday did not mention the Manchester attack.
In addition to ISIS, al-Qaeda and other extremist organizations have also recently urged their followers to carry out attacks in western countries.
