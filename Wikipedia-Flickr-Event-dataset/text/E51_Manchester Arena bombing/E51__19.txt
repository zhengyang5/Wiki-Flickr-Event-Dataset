The UK is on a critical terror alert with military troops set to bolster police forces after the Prime Minster raised the threat level to its highest possible rating.

Theresa May made the sombre announcement in a live television statement from Downing Street on Tuesday evening.

The move comes amid fears the Manchester attacker, Salman Abedi, did not act alone.

It means a terrorist attack is considered imminent.

"It is a possibility that we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack," Mrs May said.
