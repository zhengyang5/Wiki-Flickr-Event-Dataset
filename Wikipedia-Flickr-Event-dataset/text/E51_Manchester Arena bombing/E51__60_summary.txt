The Manchester Arena bomber, Salman Abedi, was not known to the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme, police have said.
“Abedi was not known to the Prevent programme.
Abedi had been examined by security service case officers in the past.
I decided to stay.”Alex Huyton, 30, and Elliot Lowe, 43, who live opposite the raided house, came back from the doctor’s to find their road blocked off.
“I’ve got no idea what’s going on.” Neither of them know who lives in the raided house, which has been under 24-hour surveillance by police since Thursday.
