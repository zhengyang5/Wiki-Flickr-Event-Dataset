May 23, 2017 Police cordon off the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England.
Ahmed Dagdoug, a spokesman for Libya’s counterterrorism Reda Force, said Hashem Abedi was arrested late Tuesday and is suspected of “planning to stage an attack in Tripoli.”Dagdoug said Hashem Abedi had confessed to helping his brother prepare the Manchester attack.
Dagdoug said Hashem Abedi had been in frequent contact with Salman Abedi and was aware of the plans to attack the concert.
Dagdoug described Hashem Abedi as an operative of the Islamic State, which has asserted responsibility for Monday’s blast.
It was unclear whether investigators believed that Salman Abedi’s relatives were a key part of the network planning the Manchester attack.
