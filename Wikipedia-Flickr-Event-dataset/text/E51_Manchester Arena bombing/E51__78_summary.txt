It was a conscious display of unity in the face of Britainâ€™s deadliest terrorist attack since July 7th 2005.
At first it appeared likely that someone other than Mr Abedi made the relatively sophisticated explosive device.
However, the discovery of bomb-making equipment at the rented flat in Manchester that Mr Abedi briefly occupied before the attack now suggests otherwise.
There is also evidence of Mr Abedi shopping for the materials needed to construct the device over a period of several weeks.
There is no evidence yet that the Manchester attack was timed to disrupt the election on June 8th.
