Additional security measures were in place for the Great Manchester Run, where tens of thousands of runners took part, including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham.
Greater Manchester Police have made an appeal to the public for information about the bomber's movements since 18 May, when he returned to the UK.
Police said the investigation - which is "making good progress" - has around 1,000 people working on it and hundreds more officers involved in the security across Greater Manchester.
In total 15 people have been arrested in Greater Manchester, Warwickshire and Merseyside - but a woman and a 16-year-old boy were later released without charge.
