Ariana Grande was spotted arriving back in the United States on Tuesday, May 23, just hours after the suicide bombing at her concert in Manchester, England.
“Mac ran up to give her a hug and kiss right after her plane landed,” an eyewitness tells Us.
As previously reported, at least 22 people were killed and at least 59 were injured in an attack outside the Manchester Arena on Monday night immediately after Grande wrapped up her show.
“Ariana is inconsolable,” a source exclusively told Us.
A source close to the singer told Us an official decision hasn’t been made, noting that Ariana and her team are focusing on the victims for the time being.
