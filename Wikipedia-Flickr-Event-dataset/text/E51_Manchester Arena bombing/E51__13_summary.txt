Sikh temples in Manchester are offering shelter to those affected by the deadly terrorist bombing at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday.
“Sikh Temples in Manchester, UK offering food & accommodation.
They are open for ALL people,” said Harjinder Kukreja in a Tweet, posting the address of Sikh temples located in the area.
Many other local people took to Twitter to offer those affected beds for the night, using the hastag #RoomForManchester.
