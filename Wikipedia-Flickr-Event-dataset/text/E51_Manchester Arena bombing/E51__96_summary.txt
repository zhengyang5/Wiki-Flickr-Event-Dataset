The Question Time debate turns to the leaking of details of the Manchester investigation - including photos from the scene - to the US media.
Amber Rudd says Theresa May has raised the matter with US President Donald Trump, and that she does not think the leaks have damaged the investigation.
The home secretary, who has previously expressed her irritation at the reports appearing in the US media, adds: "It must have been such a terrible thing for the families to see."
Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham says what has happened is "absolutely outrageous".
"It's wrong, it's arrogant of the Americans and it's disrespectful to the people of Greater Manchester and most importantly the families of those who have died."
