A rift between the Trump administration and US security services contributed to a series of leaks by American officials about the Manchester bombing, British officials believe.
Jeffrey Ringel, a former counter-terrorism special agent in the FBI, said daily intelligence sharing with British and other foreign law enforcement agencies had been central to his job.
In that way, he said, it was possible for the intelligence leaks to do permanent damage.
The Manchester leaks came soon after Trump shared top-secret intelligence, apparently provided by Israel, in a White House meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak.
Meanwhile, leaks about the investigation into the links of the Trump camp to the Kremlin are an almost daily occurrence.
