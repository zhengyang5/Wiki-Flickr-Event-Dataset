College students were among those who raised ‘concerns’ about Abedi years ago.
The college confirmed that Abedi joined in 2013 to study Business before leaving to further his studies at Salford University.
In an interview before his arrest, Ramadan Abedi rejected claims he was a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, but added that he supports the organisation, which is banned in the UK.
In the translated interview, shown on BBC, he said: “I condemn anyone who says I belong to Libyan Islamic Fighting Group.
It is unbelievable.”Abedi was previously a student at Burnage Academy for Boys and Manchester College, and had studied at Salford University but dropped out before finishing.
