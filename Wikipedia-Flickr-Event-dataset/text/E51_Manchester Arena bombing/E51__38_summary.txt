A former manager at Didsbury Mosque, where Manchester bomber Salman Abedi and his family worshipped, has said that the 22-year-old was a promising young man who became withdrawn and aggressive in his teenage years.
“He didn't like to talk to anybody but when he did he was really very aggressive,” the mosque manager said.
He is believed to still be in the country’s western capital Tripoli and the mosque manager described him as a Salafist, an adherent to an ultra-conservative school of Sunni Islamic thought.
The Islamic State militant group (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for the suicide bomb attack.
The office for the British Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to say whether the bomber was linked to Islamist extremism.
