The sister of Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi believes her brother carried out the manchester attack because he wanted revenge for US air strikes on Syria.

Jomana Abedi said in an interview her brother was kind and loving and that she was surprised by what he did on Monday.

At least 22 people were killed and dozens seriously injured when 22-year-old Abedi detonated a device as fans left an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena.

Ms Abedi said she thought he was driven by America's military attacks in the Middle East.

â€œI think he saw children - Muslim children - dying everywhere, and wanted revenge," she told the Wall Street Journal.
