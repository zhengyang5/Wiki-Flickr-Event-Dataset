Salman Abedi, the Manchester bomber, reportedly passed through Germany four days before the attack.
Abedi transited through Düsseldorf airport on his way home to Manchester from Istanbul last Thursday, according to police sources.
German authorities are urgently checking whether Abedi met with anyone in Germany, the usually well informed Focus magazine quoted unnamed “security sources” as saying.
Police in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia told the BBC he is not believed to have leaved the airport transit area.
