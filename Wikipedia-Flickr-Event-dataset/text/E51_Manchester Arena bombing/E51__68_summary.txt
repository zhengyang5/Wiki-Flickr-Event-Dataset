In a briefing to the media on Thursday, investigators said that others may have been complicit in helping Abedi.
Abedi visited Abdallah twice, in January and March 2017 at HMP Altcourse in Liverpool.
Abedi was born in Manchester to Libyan parents, who moved back to Tripoli in recent years, along with his younger siblings.
He is believed to have visited Libya shortly before the attack, arriving back in the UK on 18 May.
Jackson said Abedi travelled to Libya a number of times and they were investigating how he obtained the skills to make a bomb.
