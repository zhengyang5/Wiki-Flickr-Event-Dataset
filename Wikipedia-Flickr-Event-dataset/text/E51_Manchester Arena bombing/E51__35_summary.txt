I think that has to be part of the story.
It is a tragedy, the loss of life is truly appalling, but as a city, as a community, we will continue to pull together, and we will not allow ourselves to be beaten.
We donâ€™t know what the cause is yet.
Clearly there is lots of supposition taking place.
But this is not something that we are going to allow to beat us as a Manchester community.
