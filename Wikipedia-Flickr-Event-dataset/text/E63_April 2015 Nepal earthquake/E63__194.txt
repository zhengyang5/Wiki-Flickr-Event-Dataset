NZ aid workers off to Nepal

Two aid workers and an engineer from New Zealand are heading to Nepal to help after the devastating magnitude 7.8 earthquake.

Two New Zealand Red Cross aid workers left for Nepal on Friday after a call from the organisation's international federation.

Donna Collin, a nurse and midwife from Whangarei, will be carrying out health assessments in villages outside the Kathmandu Valley.

Jacqui Dixon, an aid worker from Morrinsville, will be coordinating Red Cross teams' safety and security across Nepal.

More than 6000 people have died and there is concern for the welfare of hundreds of thousands of people after the earthquake on Saturday.

Those in remote areas outside the Kathmandu Valley are facing an unknown fate.

In some areas 90 per cent of the homes have been destroyed, the Red Cross says.

Nepalese-born New Zealand engineer Jitendra Bothara has also left for Nepal.

He is joining a team from Miyamoto Global Disaster Relief Fund, who are global specialists in post earthquake seismic engineering and disaster relief.

The team has experience responding to killer quakes in countries including Haiti, New Zealand, Japan and Italy.

In Nepal they will assist public and international agencies and the private sector in building damage and safety assessment.

"The problem is the building quality and the buildings are extremely, extremely vulnerable," says Mr Bothara who worked on developing a building code for Nepal in the 1990s.

"We have been expecting a big earthquake in the region, the only question was when."

The New Zealand government has pledged $2 million aid.

It has also offered its Urban Search and Rescue team, which is on standby.
