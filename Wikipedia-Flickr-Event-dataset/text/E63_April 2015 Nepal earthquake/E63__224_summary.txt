The latest pledge, which comes after leading UK aid agencies launched a TV appeal for donations, means Britain now tops the league of financial donors.
Nepal has declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake and subsequent aftershocks.
The televised appeal was launched on Tuesday by the Disasters Emergency Committee, an umbrella organisation which brings together 13 UK aid charities to deal with international crises.
An RAF plane carrying aid supplies and Army troops has also been sent to the country.
