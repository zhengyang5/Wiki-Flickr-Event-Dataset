Navesh Chitrakar/ReutersA magnitude-7.8 earthquake hit just 80 kilometres northwest of Nepal's capital Kathmandu on 25 April, destroying buildings and devastating much of the city.
Nature looks at the geological and social circumstances that combined to make the Nepal quake so deadly.
Nepal has a small but experienced community of earthquake professionals, and a national network of seismic and geodetic monitoring stations.
On 12 April, two of them — the National Society for Earthquake Technology-Nepal in Sainbu and GeoHazards International of Menlo Park, California — updated their earthquake scenarios for the Kathmandu Valley.
Assuming that this earthquake is the largest event in this seismic episode, Nepal can expect more than 30 aftershocks greater than magnitude 5 over the next month.
