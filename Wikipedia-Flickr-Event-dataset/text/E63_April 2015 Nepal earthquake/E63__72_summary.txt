The atmosphere at Nepal’s Pokhara airport was one of chaos mingled with relief as planes finally took off from the tourist town where visitors had been trapped since a 7.8 earthquake hit the country on April 25.
A Yeti Airlines aircraft had been on standby in the capital waiting for the green light to begin its shuttle missions.
Those who managed to get on the first Yeti Airlines flights from Pokhara arrived at Tribhuvan to witness the arrival of international rescue teams.
Large planes and helicopters – some from the Indian Air Force – loomed near the runway as the Pokhara flight touched down.
Men in camouflage trooped into a gray helicopter bearing its logo as the relieved travellers made their way from Yeti Airlines craft.
