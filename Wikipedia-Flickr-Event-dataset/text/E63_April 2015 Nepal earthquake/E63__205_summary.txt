SINGAPORE - The Singapore Civil Defence Force is preparing to send a 55-man search-and-rescue contingent to Nepal in the wake of Saturday's earthquake.
The Government added that it is making a contribution of $100,000 to kick-start the Singapore Red Cross appeal for donations.
In a Facebook post on Sunday morning, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) C-130 will ferry the search-and-rescue team to Nepal.
The plane will also airlift aid and ferry a 15-man medical team from the SAF, as well as personnel from Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) Coordination Centre to aid in relief efforts in Nepal.
We share their anxiety and concern for their families, and will do all we can to aid Nepal in this time of need."
