The 7.9-magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal and neighbouring Indian states on Saturday, leaving a massive trail of death and devastation, jolted memories of the catastrophic 1934 tragedy, which had claimed several thousands of human lives on both sides of the Himalayas.
In Nepal, three important cities -- Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan were badly hit, while in India, the region of north- Bihar including Monghyer (now Munger), Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur were practically levelled.
Incidentally, before Nepal schedule, Chandra's team was shooting in Darbhangha, including at the ruins of the 'Naulakha Palace', when Bihar was hit by a massive storm.
The 19th century Dharhara Tower, which too was damaged in the 1934 earthquake, and was rebuilt later, was today practically obliterated.
