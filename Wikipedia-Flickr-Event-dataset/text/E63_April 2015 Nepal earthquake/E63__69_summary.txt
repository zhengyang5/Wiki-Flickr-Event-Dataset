(Wally Santana/Associated Press)KATHMANDU, Nepal â€” Soon after landing at Kathmandu airport, the Thai Airways captain made a bizarre announcement to passengers: Nobody is in the control tower.
We waited while airport officials inspected the tarmac for damage and cracks.
Although the part of the city we drove through appeared largely undamaged, everyone, everywhere seemed to be sitting outside.
This short trip from the airport merely hinted at the devastation this country has felt.
