Landslides in Langtang during and after the Nepal earthquakeThe situation in the rural areas of Nepal after the earthquake is slowly, very slowly, becoming apparent.
It is clear that landslides and avalanches have been a very significant factor in this area, both during the earthquake itself and in the aftermath.
Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.” “This is the latest news that I have as of 5pm on April 28th.”This is the Langtang valley in question:.
I assume that the landslide / avalanche at Langtang is the one that appeared in this tweeted image from early yesterday:.
Heavy snow had been falling near the village, Ghodatabela, and the ground may have been loosened by the quake.
