The Chinese International Search and Rescue Team sets off for Nepal for disaster relief on April 25, 2015.
Because there’s not enough space for equipment, we have to go manual,” said by Fu Yunpeng, the captain of Chinese rescue team.
The China International Search and Rescue Team (CISAR) left Nepal at 6 a.m. Sunday Beijing time following a massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday.
It is the tenth mission the rescue team carry out since its establishment.
The team, taking a chartered plane, arrived in Kathmandu midday Sunday, the China Earthquake Administration announced.
