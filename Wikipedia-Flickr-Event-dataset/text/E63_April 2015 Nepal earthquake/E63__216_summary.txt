Taiwan’s initial offer to send search and rescue teams to Nepal after the devastating earthquake Saturday was declined by the government, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
Search teams from Israel, the United States, Britain, Japan and Finland are already in Nepal or en route.
While its offer to provide a rescue team was declined, Taiwan is providing other aid to Nepal.
A private joint medical team from three Taiwan charities is also expected to arrive in Nepal on Tuesday.
And the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps are also sending medical assistance.
