HKSARG to provide relief and financial assistance for quake victims in Nepal************************************************************

In view of the massive injuries and loss of lives caused by the earthquake in Nepal, a spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) announced today (April 28) that it would apply for a supplementary provision of $50 million from the Finance Committee (FC) of the Legislative Council to enable an injection to the Disaster Relief Fund for making a donation to the Government of Nepal as contribution to their relief work.



The spokesman said the Government will make a submission to the FC as soon as possible for their consideration.



Meanwhile, the Secretariat of the Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee has already contacted a number of local relief organisations and learned that some of them have plans to apply for the Disaster Relief Fund to carry out emergency relief programmes in Nepal.



The Committee would expeditiously process the funding proposals upon receipt of applications so as to enable the provision of early relief to the needy, added the spokesman.
