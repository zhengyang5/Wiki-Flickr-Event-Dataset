"A massive block of Earth's crust, roughly 75 miles long (120km) and 37 miles (60km) wide, lurched 10 feet (3m) to the south Saturday over the course of 30 seconds.
Riding atop this block of the planet was the capital of Nepal – Kathmandu – and millions of Nepalese."
That's the description of Saturday's earthquake from University of Colorado geologist Roger Bilham, a world-renowned expert on Himalayan earthquakes.
The process has created the lofty Tibetan plateau and pushed up mountains that reach nearly 30,000 feet above sea level.
But this one was relatively shallow, which intensifies the surface shaking, and its epicentre was closer to Kathmandu than the 1934 temblor.
