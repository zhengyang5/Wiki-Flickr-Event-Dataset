A Nepal police official says at least 1,910 people have been killed, including at least 721 in Kathmandu.
More than 5,000 in Nepal have been injured as a result of the earthquake, said Home Ministry official Laxmi Dhakal.
The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.
The military experts will determine whether the full disaster-response team should be sent to help Nepal recover.
Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.
