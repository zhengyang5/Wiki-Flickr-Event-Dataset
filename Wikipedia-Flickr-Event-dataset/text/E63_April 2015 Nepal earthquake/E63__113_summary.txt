Now it is drawing conservators racing to fix ominous fissures in the main white-domed stupa as the summer monsoon fast approaches.
According to UNESCO documents, more than 30 monuments in the Kathmandu Valley collapsed in the quakes, and another 120 incurred partial damage.
Statues and carved lintels litter the sites of collapsed temples and shrines, but local communities are policing these areas.
Especially hard hit in the quakes were the structures in the three Durbar squares, as well as Changu Narayan, according to Andolfatto.
Three other important squares in the Kathmandu Valley, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, were hard hit by the quakes, but most are well documented.
