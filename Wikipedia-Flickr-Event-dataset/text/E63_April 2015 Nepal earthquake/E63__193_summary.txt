Dutch rescue specialists will leave Eindhoven Air Base Sunday night on a military jet packed with supplies destined for Nepal, where an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale ravaged the region on Saturday.
Over 2000 people are confirmed dead, the ministry said, with the earthquake also causing fatalities in Bangladesh, China and India.
“Our aid workers have a great deal of experience, and are immediately available.” A unit of 62 people and eight dogs from the Dutch Urban Search and Rescue Team (USAR) was mobilized for the mission.
The USAR team is capable of operating independently, and will not rely on local sources of food or shelter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added.
The Dutch Relief Alliance will manage the cabinet’s financial commitment.
