Jul 30, 2015-Children belonging to Chepang and Tamang communities in the district are suffering from severe malnutrition after the April 25 earthquake, a government study has shown.
The group surveyed 747 children of 40 VDCs in the district and found that 78 among them were severely malnourished while a further 126 suffered from mild malnutrition.
District coordinator of Nutrition Programme Dhiraj Adhikari said that the severely malnourished children were provided with healthcare while the mildly malnourished were given nutritional supplements.
Further, mothers were trained on making nutritious food and pregnant women were given health suggestions, he added.
Children, elderly citizens, pregnant and postpartum women stay under temporary makeshifts and tents in several quake-hit areas.
