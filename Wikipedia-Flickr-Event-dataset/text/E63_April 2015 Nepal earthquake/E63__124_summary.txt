May 2, 2015-Nepal is satisfied with the level of coordination with the Nepal Army and among foreign militaries carrying out relief missions the last few days in quake-hit areas, according to Chief of Army Staff (CoAS) Gaurav SJB Rana.
Given the size of the Great Earthquake and the logistics involved in the subsequent relief operations, coordination was always going to be difficult, said CoAS Rana on Friday at a press briefing organised at the Army Headquarters.
Asked if he was content with coordination among foreign missions and between the Nepal Army and the civilian leadership, Rana said that it was important to be patient.
An International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) team, supposed to arrive within 30 hours of a disaster, had failed to do so, claimed CoAS Rana.
“The Nepal Army and the police moved in immediately,” he said.
