The body of missing Israeli trekker Or Asraf was located in Nepal early Sunday morning, an Israeli relief team announced, over a week after he disappeared following a devastating earthquake.
“We regret to report that during the morning hours the team located a body identified as Or Asraf’s.
Speaking to Israeli media from Nepal, Patrick Asraf said 20 of his son’s friends — who are part of the IDF Egoz unit — were braving dangerous terrain, in the dark, to bring Or Asraf’s body to the closest village.
ZAKA arrived in Nepal last week in a joint task force along with Israeli rescue organizations United Hatzalah and F.I.R.S.T.
to assist in the rescue efforts and attempt to locate Asraf, the last Israeli citizen who remained out of contact since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked the Himalayan nation.
