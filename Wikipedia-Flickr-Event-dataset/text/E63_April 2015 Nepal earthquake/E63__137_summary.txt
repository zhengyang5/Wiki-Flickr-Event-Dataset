Biman Bangladesh Airlines officials said the flight, Boeing 737, was sent to the Nepalese capital at 1:30pm without communicating with the Tribhuvan International Airport authorities.
Failing to get the landing clearance, the Biman flight, which had 83 passengers on board, returned to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka around 4:00pm, officials said.
We should have inquired [about the landing] before sending the flight to Kathmandu,‚Äù said a top Biman official, wishing not to be named.
Biman sent another scheduled flight, Aircraft A 310, to Kathmandu with 105 passengers on board at 5:30pm.
The authorities at the airport in Nepal allowed the flight to land there around 8:00pm as it was carrying some relief materials, said officials.
