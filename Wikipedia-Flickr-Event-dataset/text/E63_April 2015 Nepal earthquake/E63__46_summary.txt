Langtang Village, northeast of the capital, Kathmandu, was obliterated by a massive avalanche and it now appears certain that Habash was there.
Yasmine Habash cried Tuesday as she recounted the terrible destruction to a place that is so beautiful and spiritual.
More than 100 local people continued to dig through the rubble when Yasmine Habash and her boyfriend arrived in Langtang Village.
Yasmine Habash and her mother made annual trips to India and she was with her mother there for five weeks this spring.
“I still want to do everything we can for Nepal and Langtang,” Yasmine Habash said.
