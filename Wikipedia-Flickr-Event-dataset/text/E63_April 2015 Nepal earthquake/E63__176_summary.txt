Kathmandu, Jun 25 (PTI): India on Thursday pledged $1 billion in assistance to quake-ravaged Nepal for its massive reconstruction programme, asserting that it will strongly stand behind the Nepalese government which is seeking help to “wipe the tears” of every Nepali.
Swaraj hoped that a “stronger, united and more confident Nepal will rise” from the debris of destruction.
She said one fourth of the $1 billion assistance will be grant and it will be over and above India's existing bilateral developmental assistance of another $1 billion over the next five years which takes the total assistance to $2 billion.
”We reacted as if a disaster had struck India,” Swaraj said.
Without doubt, from the debris of destruction, a stronger, united and more confident Nepal will rise,” Swaraj said.
