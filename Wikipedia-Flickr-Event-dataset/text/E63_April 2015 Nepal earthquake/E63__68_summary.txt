Not far from Cook is her colleague Christoff Andermann, another GFZ geologist, who is performing maintenance on a broadband seismometer, a device that measures shaking across a wide range of frequencies.
Seismometers are a relatively new addition to landslide studies by the GFZ researchers and their colleagues.
Quake-stricken hills also have an increased sensitivity to rainfall, says Niels Hovius, a GFZ geologist who is leading the Nepal study.
With the seismic data, researchers can model the physics of slope stability and monitor changes in ground properties that might precipitate a landslide.
The Durham sensors are within the area covered by the GFZ seismic array, so the teams will pool their field data.
