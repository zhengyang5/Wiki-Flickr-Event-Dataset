Canada on Monday sent a C-17 military transport plane loaded with emergency supplies to Nepal and ordered 150 troops on standby to travel overseas to help earthquake victims.

"We join the rest of the world in mourning the tragic loss of life that has occurred in Nepal and throughout the region as a result of Saturday's earthquake," Defense Minister Rob Nicholson said.

Ottawa pledged Can$5 million in humanitarian assistance over the weekend, and Nicholson announced Monday that the government would also match individual Canadians' donations, estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars so far.

Ottawa also offered to expedite immigration applications from the devastated region, which was struck by a huge 7.8 magnitude quake on Saturday, as well as extend student, work or visitor visas for Nepalese.

The C-17 is expected to arrive in Kathmandu on Wednesday morning to deliver emergency supplies including blankets, cans, kitchen sets, hygiene kits, search and rescue equipment, tarps, all-terrain vehicles and an ambulance.

But it was not clear if it would be able to land due to damage to the airport in Nepal's capital.

The jumbo jet will also evacuate Canadians in Nepal and India, who number at least 388, according to Canada's foreign ministry.
