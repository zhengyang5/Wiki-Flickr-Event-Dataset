At the end of a dirt track, a few hundreds meters from the former Nepali Prime Minister’s house, locals were spending day three in a self-built camp, writes Anna Codrea-Rado.

Inside an orange tent, Lawang Lama, 35, was laying on a camping matt next to his sister-in-law, Yang Chan Dulkar. The two had been there since the quake, along with five other members of their family.

In an abandoned field usually used as a dumping ground in the Baluwatar neighbourhood of Kathmandu, hundreds of Nepalis were sheltering from the midday sun under tarpaulin and in tents. Men were cuddled around tables playing betting games with cards and children were playing football.

Lama, a trekking guide, had returned to Kathmandu from Annapurna Base Camp where he had been leading climbers, a few days before the earthquake hit.

“We’re scared,” Lama said. The family brought the tent and supplies from their house, but they said they do not have enough food or water. Dulkar, 22, said they have not received any help or assistance from anyone so far. “We would like our government to help with food,” Dulkar said, “We just need the basics.”

She added: “We have no idea when we will go back to our houses.” She said they do not feel safe returning to their homes, which were damaged in the earthquake. The pair said when the rest of the camp starts to go home, they will too.
