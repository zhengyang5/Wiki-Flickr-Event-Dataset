At Koteswor, the thickness of the ~11 kyr BC seismite is limited bythe lithological contrast between the deformed silty level and theunderneath undeformed sandy level.
11 shows the averag e shear stress leve l that would be reach ed atdepth during the ~11 kyr BP and 1833 AD events.
Nonetheless, the ~ 11 kyr seismiteindicates that earthquakes shocked the Kathmandu basin with anintensity greater than MMI X.
The 1255 AD eventThe 1255 AD event badly damaged Kathmandu and is the mostcatastrophic event recorded in the Nepalese historic archives (e.g.
The thick horizontal lines refer to the intensity of 1833 and ~ 11 kyr BC events andto the thickness of the associated soft-sediment deformation.
