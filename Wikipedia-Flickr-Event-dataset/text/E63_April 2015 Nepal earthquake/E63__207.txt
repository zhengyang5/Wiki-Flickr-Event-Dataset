The funds will be secured from the budget reserves and will be provided through the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

The decision was announced by Prime Minister Miro Cerar, who added that Slovenia was also open for other forms of assistance.

A possible form of help would also be to deploy a group of doctors to Nepal. "We will be adjusting to the situation," the prime minister told the press.

The magnitude-7.8 earthquake hit the country last Saturday, so far killing more than 5,000 people, according to official records.
