A Chinese rescue team in Kathmandu has already rescued one victim.

The team was assigned to a group of older residential buildings. The victim, a man in his twenties, was trapped between floors of his building. The team climbed through a narrow opening in the badly damaged building to get to him. The victim appeared to be in stable condition.

“This type of situation, an earthquake of this magnitude, is very difficult for rescue. Because there’s not enough space for equipment, we have to go manual,” said by Fu Yunpeng, the captain of Chinese rescue team.

The team continues to look for more survivors.

The China International Search and Rescue Team (CISAR) left Nepal at 6 a.m. Sunday Beijing time following a massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday.

The CISAR left for Nepal to help with local disaster relief. In total 62 rescue personnel with six sniffer dogs and some emergency relief equipment set off from Beijing Capital International Airport Sunday morning. It is the tenth mission the rescue team carry out since its establishment.

The team, taking a chartered plane, arrived in Kathmandu midday Sunday, the China Earthquake Administration announced.

A massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck Nepal at 2:11 p.m. Beijing time.
