The authorities on Tuesday disposed 7,000 liters of vegetable oil provided by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the victims of earthquake. The substandard oil labeled as ‘Himalaya Refined Vegetable’ was manufactured in India and sent through UAE’s Delhi-based embassy. The oil was disposed at the Department of Commerce and Supply Management (DoCSM) in Kathmandu.

According to Director General of the DoCSM, Shambhu Koirala, the oil was destroyed after the Department of Food Technology And Quality Control division deemed it inedible.

The oil had arrived in Nepal two weeks after Great Earthquake hit Nepal on April 25. The other relief items that were brought along with oil are under scrutiny, Koirala said.
