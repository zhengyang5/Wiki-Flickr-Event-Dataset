JEDDAH: The Kingdom has sent 190 tons of aid to earthquake-hit Nepal, which includes food, tents and medical supplies, according to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The Kingdom also sent medical workers.

Martin Faller, head of operations for the federation, thanked Saudi Arabia for the donations, and said the goods were all of top quality and suited to the environmental conditions in the country.

He said the Kingdom would supply a further 1,200 tents to meet the needs of displaced people, according to a report in a local publication.

"The first of a series of Nepal earthquake registered 7.9 on the Richter Scale on april 26 and left thousands of people dead, wounded and missing. There was almost total destruction of properties in some areas that forced residents to sleep outdoors for fear of another earthquake," said Faller.

Head of the Saudi Red Crescent delegation, Suleiman Al-Hwairini, said the first part of the aid, ordered by Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman, is currently being distributed.

"The aid includes food, medicines and medical supplies to improve the humanitarian conditions of the distressed people," he said.
