"I pray for the victims, those wounded and for all those who suffer because of this calamity," Pope Francis said after reciting the "Regina Coeli" prayer with visitors gathered in St. Peter's Square April 26.
The Pontifical Council Cor Unum, which promotes and coordinates charitable giving, announced April 28 that Pope Francis had sent "a first contribution of $100,000" to assist the victims.
It said Catholic Relief Services, the U.S. Caritas partner, was sending relief materials from north India and working with Caritas Nepal to procure additional relief materials locally and in India.
