Jul 31, 2015-Women have had very little access to relief in the wake of the recent earthquakes that devastated country’s 15 districts, according to a report.
The report released on Thursday by the Inter-party Women’s Alliance (IPWA) says single women faced the most hardship while getting access to relief.
“We found women in general and single women in particular faced more hardship in comparison to men while receiving relief,” said Sashi Shrestha, president of the alliance.
The situation had resulted due to lack of women representation in disaster management committee, the study has found.
The report also suggests distributing relief on the basis of households has not been effective and that it be replaced by counting the number of family members.
