Taiwan’s initial offer to send search and rescue teams to Nepal after the devastating earthquake Saturday was declined by the government, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday.

Nepalese officials told Taiwan that they only wanted to take such aid from neighboring countries.

Taiwan experiences frequent earthquakes and has well trained emergency response personnel. The rejection of search and rescue aid prompted concerns in Taiwan that the offer may have been rebuffed because Nepal did not want to offend the Chinese government.

China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, seeks to limit the self-ruled island’s international recognition. China refuses to have ties with nations that recognize Taiwan, and pressures international organizations not to recognize Taiwan as an independent state.

Andrew Kao, a deputy foreign minister of Taiwan, said Monday that the distance between Taiwan and Nepal, and the lack of formal diplomatic relations contributed to the rejection of Taiwan’s offer.

Tara Prasad Pokharel, a spokesman for Nepal’s Foreign Ministry, said he did not know of the offer.

China, India and Pakistan have all sent search and rescue teams. But such help is also coming from farther away. Search teams from Israel, the United States, Britain, Japan and Finland are already in Nepal or en route.

While its offer to provide a rescue team was declined, Taiwan is providing other aid to Nepal. The Taiwanese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday it was dispatching a team from Taiwan International Health Action, which oversees emergency humanitarian medical aid.

A private joint medical team from three Taiwan charities is also expected to arrive in Nepal on Tuesday. And the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps are also sending medical assistance.
