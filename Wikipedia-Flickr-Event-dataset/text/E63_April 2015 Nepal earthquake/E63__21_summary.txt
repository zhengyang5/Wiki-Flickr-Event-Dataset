more-inThe main fault in Nepal marks where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates crash into each other -- also known as the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) fault.
Recent studies have shown that this fault has a rich history of evident and not-so-evident quakes, and was ripe for another major one.
Other than these “surface rupture” quakes, scientists have also found evidence of multiple “blind thrust” quakes that did not break the surface.
Surface rupture quakes are not only extremely violent, but also they tend to release most or all of the accumulated strain in the fault.
“Blind thrust” quakes are ones that do not break the surface, and tend to be more frequent.
