(Seism Res Lett 87:957–962, 2015) to analyse the distribution of ground motions at near-field and regional distances.
We show that the data are consistent with the instrumental peak ground acceleration (PGA) versus macroseismic intensity relationship developed by Worden et al.
(Bull Seism Soc Am 102:204–221, 2012), and use this relationship to estimate peak ground acceleration from intensities (PGA EMS ).
Ground motions were significantly amplified in the southern Gangetic basin, but were relatively low in the northern basin.
The overall distribution of ground motions and damage during the Gorkha earthquake thus reflects a combination of complex source, path, and site effects.
