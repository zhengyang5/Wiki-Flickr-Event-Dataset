International aid groups, including Turkey's Prime Ministry Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) rushed to respond on Saturday to a massive earthquake in Nepal that claimed more than 1,000 lives as aftershocks and severed communications hampered rescue efforts.
It was reported that AFAD will be dispatching a search and rescue team consisting of 25 people, and a medical aid team consisting of 10 people to Nepal on Saturday.
Another search and rescue crew consisting of 45 people is also expected to be dispatched on Sunday, along with humanitarian aid.
The Turkish Red Crescent has also announced that they will be sending aid consisting of 1000 blankets and 300 food parcels to the victims of the earthquake in Nepal on Saturday night.
In Europe, Britain, Germany and Spain also pledged support and assistance, with Norway promising to provide 30 million krone ($3.9 million, 3.5 million euros) in humanitarian aid.
