The devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday, killing hundreds, has also destroyed several historic landmarks.
Kathmandu's nine-story Dharahara Tower, first built in 1832, was reduced to rubble.
The tower had already been destroyed and rebuilt once before, following a 1934 earthquake.
About 200 people were trapped inside the tower when it collapsed, according to police.
