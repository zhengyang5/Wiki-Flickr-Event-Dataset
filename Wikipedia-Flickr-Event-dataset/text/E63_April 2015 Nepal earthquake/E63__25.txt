In the following discussion, we mainly focus on the role of the

contrast of granulometry and retain that thickness is an increasing

function of intensity for a given lithology.

4.3.6. Comparison of historic and pre-historic seismites in the

Kathmandu basin

The comparison of the seismites developed during the 1833

earthquake and the ~11 kyr BC event is possible because several

conditions are similar during their development: a) the hydraulic

conditions were similar for the seismites associated with the 26

August 1833 seism that formed during the monsoon season in the

ﬂ ooding plain of the Bagmati River and for the paleo-seismites that

developed in the delta plain of the paleo-lake; b) the levels affected by

soft-deformation have the same lithological characteristics at Kotes-

wor, Gokarna and Gothatar sites, with soft-sediment deformation that

mainly affects sandy silt; c) the Bagmati and Koteswor seismites are

located in zones affected by the same ampli ﬁ cation effect of the basin

ﬁ lling as suggested by the distribution of the 1934 damages ( Fig. 2 ).

The Bagmati se ismites have nea rly a ~3 0 cm thickness not

in ﬂ uenced by a litholog ical contrast (see Secti on 3.6.3 ). These

seismites are located in an area where the village of Gokarna was

more strongly affected by the 1833 earthquake than most of the

Kathmandu valley villages (from Campbell, 1833 , printed in Bilham,

1995 ). Therefore, though the gross estimation of the intensity in the

Kathmandu basin varies from MM VIII to X ( Bilham, 1995; Chitrakar

and Pandey, 1986 ), the Gothatar and Gokarna sites have probably

suffered an MM X intensity.

At Koteswor, the thickness of the ~11 kyr BC seismite is limited by

the lithological contrast between the deformed silty level and the

underneath undeformed sandy level. The maximum thickness of the

seismite is 90 cm and gives a minimum value for the thickness of the

soft-sediment deformation level induced by the ~11 kyr BP event.

Because the Koteswor seismite is at least three times thicker than the

Bagmati seismites, we consider that the intensity of the Koteswor

earthquake was much greater than the intensity reached during the

1833 earthquake in the Gokarna area, i.e. greater than MMI X.

Fig. 11 shows the averag e shear stress leve l that would be reach ed at

depth during the ~11 kyr BP and 1833 AD events. Only two constrains

(thick hori zontal lines on Fig. 11 ) allow to buildthe strength curve of the

Kathmand u basin sediment and the wi dth of the unce rtainty doma in

outlines the dif ﬁ culty to go farther in qu anti ﬁ catio n.

4.4. Mega-earthquake occurrences in Himalaya

4.4.1. Paleo-seism record in the Kathmandu basin

The record of paleo -seisms is very d iscontinuous i n ﬂ uvial

sediment since ~ 10 kyr and numerous events, like the 1934 AD or

1255 AD earthquakes, are missing. Nonetheless, the ~ 11 kyr seismite

indicates that earthquakes shocked the Kathmandu basin with an

intensity greater than MMI X. Such intensity could not be related to

earthquakes located at a shorter distance than the 1833 or 1934

events because their ruptures extended at a distance of less than

10 km from the center of Kathmandu ( Bilham, 1995; Chen and

Molnar, 1977 ). A minimum estimation of the ~ 11 kyr earthquake

magnitude is obtained for a rupture that extended beneath the

Kathmandu basin and even in this conservative case, the great

seismite thickness is related to an event with a source magnitude

greater than the 1934 event. The development of mega-seismites in

the Kathmandu Valley during shaking events with magnitude greater

than M 8.1 therefore argues for one interpretation among those

proposed ( Lavé et al., 2005 ) for the more than 14 m-surface slip that

occurred during the ~ 1100 AD earthquake (trench 2 on Fig. 1 ): i) the

14 m-surface slip could be the sum of several surface motions

occurring during a short period and therefore dif ﬁ cult to individualize

from trench dating; ii) it could be related to an earthquake that

released the elastically stored deformation at the tip of previous

ruptures restricted to the northern part of Himalaya; the ~ 1100 AD

earthquake would ﬁ nally deliver to the surface a sum of several

events; ii) medieval-like earthquakes could nucleate below the High

Himalaya, and break through the surface trace of the MFT, leading to

cross-strike distance along the MHT of about 100 km. We favor this

last seismo-tectonic interpretation that agrees with great seismite

thickness and large surfac e displacement, hence M ≥ 8.6 paleo-

earthquakes ( Lavé et al., 2005 ).

4.4.2. The 1255 AD event

The 1255 AD event badly damaged Kathmandu and is the most

catastrophic event recorded in the Nepalese historic archives (e.g.

Shava, 1992 ). Localization of its epicenter from historical archives is

not possible because information is restricted to the Kathmandu area.

In order to precise the location of the 1255 event, a cross-section

through the MFT is described in the following and several

14

C ages

( Table 3 ) are added to a previous study performed in the western

Nepal ( Mugnier et al., 2005 ).

In the western Ne pal, (site 3 on Fig. 1 ), the M FT thrusts above 1225 –

1271 yr Cal AD sediment ( Table 3 and Mugni er et al., 2005 )a n dat e rr a c e

(T5) is folded abo ve the MFT ( Fig. 12 D) with ~ 6 m vertical offset. Six

hundred met ers north of the M FT, T5 is locate d ~ 13 m above the

present-d ay river bed and ~9 m above the T2 ter race ( Fig. 12 C) . The T5

de ﬁ nitiv e abandonment occ urred after 1398 – 1442 Cal A D from a

charcoal sa mple ( Table 3 ). As the ab andonment occu rred after the uplift

related to the ear thquake, the upli ft occurred betw een 1225 and 1442

Cal AD. We thu s suggest that ~8 m slip occ urred along the M FT in

relation wi th the 1255 AD sei smic event and ca used ~6 m uplift of the

hanging-w all; the knick point retre at that controls the upst ream

incision ( Whipple, 2004 ) would occurred at a rate of 3 – 4m / y r i n

order to induce t he abandonment of the up stream part of T5 terra ce

between 139 8 and 1442 Cal AD. An al ternative i nterpretatio n is that the

8 m-surf ace-slip is the sum o f several events and w ould explain the

abandonme nt of several smallterrace levels (T3 and T4) ( Mugnier et al.,

2005 ). Howe ver, complement ary studies indica te that T3 was ascribed

to a debris ﬂ ow of 5 m thick and T4 is of very small ext ension. The post

1832 – 188 5 Cal AD incision of terrace T2 that se als the MFT could either

be related to ent ropic in ﬂ uence or to upl ift above a blind tip of the MHT;

two great eart hquakes of MMI VIII wer e quoted in this area for the 19t h

century ( Kh attri, 1987; Qui tmeyer and Jacob, 19 79 ) and also shocked

Kathmandu ( Chitrakar an d Pandey, 1986 ); w e favor the 1866 AD event

rather than the1833 AD event that occurred eas tward (see Section 2.2 ).
