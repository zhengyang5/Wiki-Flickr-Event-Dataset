Inside an orange tent, Lawang Lama, 35, was laying on a camping matt next to his sister-in-law, Yang Chan Dulkar.
In an abandoned field usually used as a dumping ground in the Baluwatar neighbourhood of Kathmandu, hundreds of Nepalis were sheltering from the midday sun under tarpaulin and in tents.
Lama, a trekking guide, had returned to Kathmandu from Annapurna Base Camp where he had been leading climbers, a few days before the earthquake hit.
The family brought the tent and supplies from their house, but they said they do not have enough food or water.
The pair said when the rest of the camp starts to go home, they will too.
