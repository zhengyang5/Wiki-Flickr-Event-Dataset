"Given the urgency of the search and rescue operation, we have decided to send part of the KDRT first," a ministry official told reporters.
"Around 30 others search workers and medics will be sent on Friday, if possible."
The operation area and specific mission of the South Korean team will be decided through the United Nations, added the official.
South Korea has already pledged US$1 million in initial humanitarian aid for the Himalayan nation.
Citing continued aftershocks, the ministry advised South Koreans not to travel to Nepal and to leave the country if possible.
