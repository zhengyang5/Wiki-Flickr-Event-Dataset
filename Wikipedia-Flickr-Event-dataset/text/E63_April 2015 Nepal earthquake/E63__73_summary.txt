Some of these bodies are of Christian worshippers who were attending services when the earthquake struck around noon on April 25.
Among the worst-hit is Kathmandu Valley, where about 400 churches, including house churches, meet for worship.
At least two churches in Kathmandu, the national capital, are known to have collapsed with believers and pastors in the buildings.
Local Christian volunteers are surveying to find out the extent of damage to Christian buildings and lives.
