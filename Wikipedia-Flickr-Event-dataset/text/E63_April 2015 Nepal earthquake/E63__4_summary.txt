On Jan. 15, 1934 at 2.28 a.m. local time, the strongest earthquake to hit Nepal in 68 years shook the Himalayan nation, killing more than 10,000 people.
Decades later, the impact of that temblor and calculations about population growth since it took place were used to predict what would happen if a similar-sized quake hit again.
Earlier this month, a group of international earthquake experts and social scientists gathered in Katmandu to assess how to prepare the city better for a quake of the same magnitude as the 1934 temblor.
The vast majority (95%) of the water pipes and half of the pumping stations and treatment plants could incur serious damage, the report predicted.
Almost all telephone exchange buildings, 60% of telephone lines and 40% of electric lines are likely to be damaged, it added.
