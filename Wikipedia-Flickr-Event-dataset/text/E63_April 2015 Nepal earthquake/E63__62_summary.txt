At least 90 British citizens are missing after Saturday’s earthquake in Nepal.
At 7.8 on the Richter scale, the earthquake killed more than 3,700 people across four countries – 3,617 in Nepal.
Desperate friends and families of foreigners still missing in Nepal have posted pictures and messages on social media, appealing for information on their whereabouts.
But at this moment we have no reports of any British nationals killed or injured.”“British embassy staff have helped over 200 British nationals who’ve presented at the embassy directly,” he added.
Jon Bennett, from Oxford Development Consultants, had travelled to Nepal two weeks ago on behalf of the UK government to assess how prepared Nepal was for an earthquake.
