This paper tests the hypothesis that spatial distributions of earthquake-induced landslides are determined by both the conditions at the time of the triggering earthquake (time-independent factors) and the legacy of past events (time-dependent factors).
Spatial distributions of earthquake-triggered landslides are determined by a combination of earthquake and local characteristics, which influence the dynamic response of hillslopes.
To identify the influence of a legacy from past events, we first use logistic regression to control for the effects of time-independent variables.
We then assess whether variability unexplained by these variables may be attributed to the legacy of past events.
