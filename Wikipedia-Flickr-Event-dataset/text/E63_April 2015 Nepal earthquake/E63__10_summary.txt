Up to 250 missing after avalanche hits Nepal trekking routeKATHMANDU, April 28 (Reuters) - Up to 250 people are missing in Nepal after an avalanche hit a village in Rasuwa district, a popular trekking area to the north of the capital Kathmandu, District Governor Uddhav Bhattarai said on Tuesday.
Foreign tourists may be among the missing in the avalanche, which hit the village of Ghodatabela.
A powerful earthquake last Saturday with a magnitude of 7.9 set off many snowslides in the Himalayan state.
