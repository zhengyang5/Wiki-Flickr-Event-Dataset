The IGMH Group has on Sunday decided to give an aid of USD 10,000 to Nepal while the country deals with a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit near Kathmandu on Saturday.
The Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH) and Hulhumalé Hospital’s board members and staff had made the decision.
The Group said that Nepal’s health sector works closely with them and that they view assisting the nation during a time of crisis as a responsibility.
“As per the information received by the Ministry so far, Maldivians in Nepal are safe and have not suffered any injuries in connection with this disaster” a statement from the Ministry said.
Asian countries are scrambling to locate thousands of their nationals stranded in Nepal after the quake hit.
