Nepal earthquake: Extra $10m provided by Australia for recovery efforts; search for bodies in Langtang village suspendedUpdatedAn additional $10 million in funding will be provided by Australia to help Nepal recover from last month's devastating magnitude-7.8 earthquake as the search for bodies in the village of Langtang was suspended due to bad weather.
The suspension of the search in the village of Langtang underscores the challenging conditions facing rescuers, soldiers and aid workers two weeks after the quake struck.
Officials remained unsure how many people were in Langtang village, in the heart of a popular trekking and climbing area, when the earthquake and landslide struck.
Mr Rimal said the search in Langtang would resume once the weather cleared and daily avalanches stop.
The bodies of nine foreigners killed in Langtang have been sent to Kathmandu, and bodies of residents have been returned to relatives.
