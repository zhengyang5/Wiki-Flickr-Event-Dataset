This ancient collision had a terrible after-effect this past Saturday: The deadly earthquake, centered in Nepal, which had an estimated death toll of nearly 4,000 people as of Monday evening.
Some 60 million years ago the oceanic lithosphere at the leading edge of the Indian plate was being subducted under southern Tibet (1).
Magma rising above the Indian plate erupted from volcanoes and formed granite intrusions.
Presumably the Indian crust was too buoyant to plunge far under Tibet; as a result a new fault, the Main Central Thrust, broke through the Indian crust.
The straight lines without arrowheads through dots indicate thrust faults.
