Four survivors have been pulled alive from the rubble in Nepal seven days after a deadly earthquake.
Funchu Tamang, 101, was rescued yesterday with only minor injuries and airlifted to a district hospital, a local police officer said.
Police also rescued three women from under rubble today in Sindupalchowk, one of the districts worst hit by the quake.
One woman had been buried by a landslide while the other two were under the rubble of a collapsed house.
Multiple teams of rescuers from more than 20 countries have been using sniffer dogs and heat-seeking equipment to find survivors in the rubble of the capital.
