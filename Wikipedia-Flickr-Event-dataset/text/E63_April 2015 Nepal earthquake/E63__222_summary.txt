British Army Gurkha engineers are due to fly to Nepal to help disaster recovery efforts as the death toll from the country’s worst earthquake in 80 years topped 4,000.
The soldiers from the renowned Nepalese brigade were boarding an RAF C-17 transporter packed with emergency shelters and solar lanterns at Brize Norton on Monday evening.
The dozen troops are expected to be followed by more Gurkha military liaison teams, as the United Nations warned a "massive" aid operation was now needed.
One source said: “They speak the lingo and they have everything they need, from infantry to engineers, within the brigade."
Leigh Daynes, UK director of medical charity Doctors of the World, said Nepal's health system had been fragile before the earthquake.
