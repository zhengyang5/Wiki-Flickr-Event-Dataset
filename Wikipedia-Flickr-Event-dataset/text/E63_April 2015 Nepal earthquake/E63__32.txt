A landslide triggered by Saturday's earthquake has blocked the Bhedetar, Mulghat road section of Koshi Highway.

Transportation to Dhankuta, Terhatum, Sankhuwasabha, Bhojpur have been cut off due to the landslide. One-way transportation was resumed this morning but it too was stopped after another mudslide blocked the road.

Nepal Army team, which has been working to resume the blocked highway said that the removal of the debris may take some time due to muddy roads.
