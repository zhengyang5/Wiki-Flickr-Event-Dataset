more-inAs the death toll in Nepal reached 6,900, local authorities on Saturday ruled out the possibility of finding more survivors in the rubble of fallen buildings.
“We are trying our best in rescue and relief work but now I don’t think that there is any possibility of finding survivors,” Home Ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal said.
“In about a month the monsoon will set in and it will rain continuously for about three months,” he said.
A spokesperson from the UN said the initial estimate for the number of destroyed houses was 70,000; that had nearly doubled now.
There is also increasing tension now between international humanitarian agencies and the Nepal government as the UN accused Customs officials of holding up relief materials coming by truck from across the border.
