Chandra Lye, CTV EdmontonThe family of a St. Albert couple who were missing in Nepal since the earthquake have confirmed the couple’s death.
“It is with our deepest regret and sorrow that we now advise you that our sister Kathy Macmillan (Smith), and our brother Bruce Macmillan have both perished in the Nepalese earthquake.
Bruce’s sister, Louise Bentley, said Fraser had been “essential” to the search process.
The magnitude-7.8 earthquake killed more than 6,840 people, with the death toll continuing to rise as reports filter in from isolated areas.
The UN has estimated the quake affected 8.1 million people -- more than a fourth of Nepal's population of 27.8 million.
