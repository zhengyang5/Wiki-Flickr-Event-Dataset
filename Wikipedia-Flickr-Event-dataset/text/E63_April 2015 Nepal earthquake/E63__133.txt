Tasmanian Government donates $10,000 to Nepal Earthquake Appeal

Updated

The State Government will donate $10,000 to Rotary Tasmania's Nepal Earthquake Appeal.

More than 7,000 people have been killed and thousands more injured and displaced by last month's earthquake.

The Member for Braddon, Joan Rylah, said the Government wanted to help the country to rebuild.

"This is to support the people of Nepal through the devastation they've suffered," he said.

"This is not the first entry money going in, this is long-term aid to redevelop schools and infrastructure projects.

"We believe that this enables a very efficient and excellent long-term way that we can see provision of assistance to the devastation in Nepal."

Rotary Tasmania district governor Ken Moore said the organisation confident the funds will be put to good use.

"We've had a long-term relationship with the Rotary Club of [the Nepalese city] Hetauda," he said.

"We've currently got school-building and water projects under construction.

"We have every confidence in the ability of the Rotarians there to determine what the priorities and needs are following the earthquake devastation."

Rotary Tasmania has also contributed $10,000 towards the appeal and is hoping to raise $250,000.
