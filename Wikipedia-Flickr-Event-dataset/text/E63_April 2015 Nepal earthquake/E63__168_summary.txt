The Indian military has mounted a massive relief operation in quake-hit Nepal, using its fleet of transport aircraft to rush in rescue teams and relief materials and ferry back stranded Indians.
The Indian Air Force has mobilised its Il-76, C-130J Hercules and C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft and Mi-17 helicopters for Operation Maitri, the name for the relief efforts in Nepal.
The NDRF has dispatched 10 teams to Nepal for its first major operation on foreign soil.
The aircraft will carry water, food, army forward hospitals, engineering task forces, NDRF teams, medical personnel and equipment, blankets and tents.
The defence ministry has put assets of the army, air force and Border Roads Organisation on standby for relief operations.
