Image copyright AP Image caption Historic landmarks were wrecked in the earthquakeThe pictures emerging from the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, are shocking.
Nepal is used to quakes â€“ this is one of the most seismically active regions in the world.
The mountains are being built as a consequence of the Indian tectonic plate driving under Central Asia (the Eurasian tectonic plate).
Vulnerable buildingsInitial estimates of casualties, even in the biggest quakes, usually start off small, and then grow.
And the assessment is that much of the population in this region live in houses that are highly vulnerable to earthquake shaking: unreinforced brick masonry and the like.
