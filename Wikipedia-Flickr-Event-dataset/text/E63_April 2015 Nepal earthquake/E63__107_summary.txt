May 27, 2015-The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked the government to take action against the World Food Programme (WFP) for distributing substandard rice to earthquake survivors.
Locals had earlier complained that the quality of rice provided as part of relief material was poor.
The lab report showed that the quality of rice distributed by the WFP was below the criteria set by Nepal government.
The UN agency has distributed food to 1.7 million people in quake-hit districts.
The WFP, meanwhile, refuted the NHRC findings arguing that this is an issue of quality rather than safety.
