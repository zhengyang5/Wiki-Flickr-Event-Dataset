The main runway was temporarily closed to big planes because of damage.
There have been reports of cracks on the runway and other problems at the only airport capable of handling jetliners.
“You’ve got one runway, and you’ve got limited handling facilities, and you’ve got the ongoing commercial flights,” said Jamie McGoldrick, the UN co-ordinator for Nepal.
“You put on top of that massive relief items coming in, the search and rescue teams that has clogged up this airport.
The UN says the quake affected 8.1 million people —more than a quarter of Nepal’s 28m people.
