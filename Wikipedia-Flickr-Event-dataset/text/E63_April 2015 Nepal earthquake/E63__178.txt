Secretary General of the organization Ali Asghar Ahmadi sent a letter to his Nepalese counterpart Ratna Dhakhwa on Sunday to express condolences to the bereaved families of victims and voice readiness to render help to the quake-stricken people.



He said the Iranian Red Crescent Organization is prepared to provide aids to Nepal to help it cope with the critical situation.



President Hassan Rouhani, too, offered condolences to the Nepali people and government for a devastating earthquake which killed over 1,800.



The Iranian president offered his “sympathy and condolences” to the people of Nepal and President Ram Baran Yadav over the deadly earthquake on Saturday.



Earlier in the day, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham conveyed deep sorrow over the earthquake and offered Iran’s sympathy to the Nepalese government and the families of the victims.



International aid groups have rushed to Nepal as rescue efforts have been hammered by aftershocks and severed communications.



A massive earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale shook Nepal near its capital with aftershocks continuing through the region hours later.



According to the country’s Home Ministry, 1,805 have been killed and 4,718 injured by the powerful earthquake so far, but many more are feared dead under rubble as rescue efforts are underway to pull out the victims.



Also according to the country’s information minister, Minendra Rijal, the death toll could reach 4,500.
