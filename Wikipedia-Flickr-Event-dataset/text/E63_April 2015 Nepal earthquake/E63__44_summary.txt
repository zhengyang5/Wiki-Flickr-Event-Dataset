The Vietnamese American from California was among the fatalities at Mount Everest's base camp, the State Department confirmed on Monday.
At least 18 climbers, including the four Americans, died after a series of avalanches also buried the Everest base camp.
New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed when ice and rock crushed the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering.
Dr Girawong was the Level 1 base camp doctor for Seattle-based climbing firm Madison Mountaineering, with a focus on trauma.
All Sherpas and other team members are uninjured and are safe in base camp or in Gorak Shep, a nearby cluster of tea houses and lodges.'
