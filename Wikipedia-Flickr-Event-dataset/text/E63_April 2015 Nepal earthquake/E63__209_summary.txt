The team, comprised of 15 search and rescue workers, 15 medics and two assistants, as well as two sniffer dogs, will join the first batch of South Korean aid workers who arrived in Nepal on Tuesday, bringing the total to 42.
The Korea Disaster Response Team will work in Bhaktapur, about 15 kilometers east of Kathmandu, and the Nepal-Korea Friendship Hospital in nearby Thimi.
South Korea has increased the size of its disaster response team from 40 to 54 to include more medics.
"We expanded the size of the team also in consideration of the demand for search and rescue operations."
