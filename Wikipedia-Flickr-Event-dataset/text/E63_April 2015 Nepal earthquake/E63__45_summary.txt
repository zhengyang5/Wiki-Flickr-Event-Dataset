A ASEATTLE (AP) - The families of two 19-year-old Seattle women missing in Nepal since that country's devastating April 25 earthquake said Thursday their own on-site investigation has convinced them that the teens are dead.
While the families hope for final confirmation from the U.S. Embassy, "and to receive our girls' remains, we haven't, and may never," the statement said.
More than 100 people attended a candlelight vigil for the teens last week on a Seattle beach.
On Tuesday, a magnitude-7.3 quake killed at least 110 people and injured more than 2,300.
The magnitude-7.8 earthquake that hit April 25 killed more than 8,150 people, injured tens of thousands more and left hundreds of thousands homeless.
