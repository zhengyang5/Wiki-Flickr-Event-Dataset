“We’re just gearing up,” said Roger Hodgson, deputy country director in Nepal for Save the Children, an international charity that already has more than 400 people, mostly Nepali, in the country.

“People can’t get blankets, cooking equipment and other supplies in rural villages,” said Mr. Hodgson of Save the Children.
The service had previously been used after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010 and the tsunami that struck Japan in 2011.
Facebook said that it had turned on a tool for people in Nepal to let their friends and family know that they are O.K.
