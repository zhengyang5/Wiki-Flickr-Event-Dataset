The compressive strengths of stone masonry and brick masonry were found to be 12.38 and 18.75 MPa, respectively.
Another well-known devastating earthquake prior to the Gorkha earthquake was the Nepalâ€“Bihar earthquake of 1934 with a Richter magnitude of 8.4.
Similarly, Schmidt hammer tests have also been used for stone masonry structures and brick masonry structures, even though they are not well defined for use with stone masonry.
Therefore, to study stone masonry with mud mortar, we can use mortar strength combined with the compressive strength of the stone.
