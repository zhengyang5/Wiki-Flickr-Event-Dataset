The operation took 15 months and involved law enforcement agencies in Italy, the United States, Canada, Mexico and Guatemala.
Of those arrested in the operation, 175 were arrested in the United States; most were of Mexican origin and were suspected of working for Mexico’s Gulf drug cartel.
Sixteen suspected high-level drug traffickers working for Italy’s ‘Ndrangheta organized criminal clan were also arrested in the United States and Italy.
From there, the cocaine was handed over to ‘Ndrangheta members and trafficked across the Atlantic Ocean to Italy.
Once in Italy, the cocaine was sold via domestic and regional distribution networks on the European market.
