When Ye Gon opened Unimed, he gained approval from the Federal Commission for Protection against Health Risks to import restricted chemicals for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Ye Gon was arrested a year ago at a Maryland restaurant, while dining with a friend.
But authorities seized the shipment, which led to a search of Ye Gon's opulent Mexico City mansion in March 2007.
Lozano rejected the accusation and said he planned to sue Ye Gon for slander in the United States.
While living in the United States, Ye Gon gambled away nearly $126 million in Las Vegas casinos, according to the DEA.
