There has been a full scale drug war raging in Mexico for the past few years. The acts of narco-terrorism caused by the Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTO’s) have cost over 34,000 lives since 2006 in what has degenerated into an armed insurrection in many parts of Mexico. Political officials, police, and innocent civilians have been assassinated or caught in the crossfire as the Mexican DTO’s battle for drug turf in an increasingly fierce battle to see who will control the drug manufacturing, drug trafficking, and human trafficking trades in Mexico. Alliances have been formed with gangs in the United States. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has committed thousands of troops from the Mexican Army to join the counter-narcotics operations of the Mexican law enforcement forces. The Mexican DTO’s have responded by changing tactics into what amounts to an insurgency using asymmetric warfare to combat the Mexican government forces. This presentation examines the current narco-conflict in Mexico for causes, trends, and possible solutions. Recent incursions into the United States by Mexican DTO’s have increased concerns by law enforcement that this conflict could spill over into the United States.
