'Tipping point' Officials say Mexican drug gangs are active in 230 American cities.
Texas Governor Rick Perry has asked for 1,000 National Guard troops.
"We would take all resources short of DoD (Department of Defence) and National Guard troops before we reach that tipping point," he said.
But, he said, his department was engaged in planning with the National Guard and defence department "to make sure they're ready when the time comes".
Last year, a US justice department report described Mexican drug traffickers as America's biggest organised crime threat, a view reiterated by Mr Rufe.
