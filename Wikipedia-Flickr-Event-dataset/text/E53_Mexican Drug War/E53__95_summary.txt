Image caption Police raided the ranch in Jilotlan de los Dolores where the alleged cartel members were hidingPolice in Mexico say they have killed 11 suspected members of the powerful La Familia drug cartel after a shoot-out at a ranch in western Jalisco state.
Two policemen were injured in the raid that led to the arrest of 36 people, including three top cartel leaders.
Police say the arrests will weaken La Familia, which has a reputation for violence but claims to protect local communities and promote family values.
The police commissioner described the Knights Templar as an offshoot of La Familia, which had split from the cartel after the killing by security forces of La Familia leader Nazario Moreno in December 2010.
Fighting between rival factions of the La Familia cartel displaced at least 2,000 people from their homes in Michoacan state this week.
