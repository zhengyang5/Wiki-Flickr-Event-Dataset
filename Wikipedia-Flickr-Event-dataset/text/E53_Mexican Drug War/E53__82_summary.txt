According to the agreement, journalists should “Ignore and discard information given out by criminal groups for propaganda purposes,” and avoid turning criminals into heroes or victims, as this helps them build support with the population.
Curiously, the bloodthirsty group has often claimed to be on the government’s side in the battle against other drug cartels such as the Zetas.
The new agreement is an attempt by Mexico’s media establishment, backed by the government, to fight back against this by limiting coverage of the cartel’s communications.
In a move that foreshadowed the media agreement, earlier this month Juarez Mayor Hector Murguia Lardizabal asked news outlets not to report on narco-banners that threatened new security chief Julian Leyzaola Perez.
Mexico’s DTOs have made new media their own – distributing press releases to blogs, uploading “narco” ballads and posting videos on YouTube.
