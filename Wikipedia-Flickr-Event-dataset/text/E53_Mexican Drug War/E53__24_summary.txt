AP Islamic terrorist groups are setting up shop in Mexico and forming alarming ties with the country's brutal drug cartels, according to a 2010 internal memo from the Tucson Police Department.
As evidence, it points to the 2010 Tijuana arrest of Hezbollah militant Jameel Nasr, who was allegedly tasked with establishing a Hezbollah network in Mexico and South America.
According to Yousef, the weapons were stored in Mexico after being smuggled from Iraq by members of Hezbollah.
The memo warns that consequences of partnerships between Hezbollah and Mexico's drug partnerships could be disastrous for Mexico's drug war, given Hezbollah's advanced weapons capabilities â€” specifically their expertise with improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
The terrorists benefit from Mexico's drug war lawlessness and its porous border with their primary target: The United States.
