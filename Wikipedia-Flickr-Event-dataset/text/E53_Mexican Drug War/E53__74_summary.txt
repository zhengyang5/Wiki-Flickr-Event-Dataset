As sad as it sounds, this situation is something that some families in Mexico have experienced.
It's not new that Mexico is having problems with violence and crime, coming either from drug-cartels or from organized mafias of kidnappers and car thieves, among others.
However, I've always told my friends and colleagues that there are other elements in the equation that also matter a lot, namely, poverty reduction and inequality.
How are inequality, crime and violence related?
The second thing is Progresa-Oportunidades, the conditional-cash-transfer (CCT) program in Mexico that fights extreme poverty by increasing the human capital of people that really need help.
