President Obama has authorized the call-up of as many as 1,200 National Guard troops along the U.S. border with Mexico to assist with border protection and enforcement activities there, officials say.
Earlier this month they wrote a letter to Obama urging him to authorize deployment of Guard troops.
"The governors of Arizona and Texas have requested the deployment of the National Guard, and the governor of New Mexico has deployed his state's National Guard to the border," they wrote on May 17.
President George W. Bush made a similar order in 2006 to send National Guard troops to assist Border Patrol, but they served primarily in a support role.
The U.S. Border Patrol says apprehensions along the Arizona-Mexico frontier are up 6 percent from October to April.
