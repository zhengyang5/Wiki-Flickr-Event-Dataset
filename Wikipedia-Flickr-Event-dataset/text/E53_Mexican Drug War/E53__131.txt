Mexican Soldier in the Acapulco Shootout of June 8, 2009 Mexico's Drug War See also Wars and Conflicts of Mexico The Mexican Drug War is an armed conflict taking place between various drug cartels and organizations and the Mexican government. The government attempted crack down on the drug organizations through arrests of high-level leaders and other figures in the drug trade, but as some cartels are dismantled or become leaderless due to arrest or death, new, often more violent power struggles begin over leadership of the cartels. The current situation is largely a result of the fact that Mexico is a main conduit for illegal drugs flowing into the United States, and the drug-producing and smuggling organizations known as cartels, have become very rich, powerful, and well-armed as they grow and protect their business interests. The Mexican government,led by newly-elected President Felipe Calderón ordered a force of 6,000 armed soldiers on December 11 of 2006, to the state of Michoacán to stop the increasingly violent warfare between rival drug cartels. The cartels responded with violent attacks on Mexican police and military forces. At least 4,100 people, including over 450 government police and troops have died in the Drug War since December, 2006. On June 8, 2009, a fierce gunbattle between the Mexican army and drug cartel gunmen in Acapulco, resulted in 16 dead gunmen and two dead soldiers. The Mexican Drug War raged on througout 2010, claiming 8,528 more lives in 2010. As of October, 2010, the total loss of life in Mexico in this war ran to 27,903.
