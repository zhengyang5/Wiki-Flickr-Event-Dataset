TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Seventeen Mexican drug gang members were killed near the U.S. border on Saturday, their bodies scattered along a road after one of the deadliest shootouts in Mexicoâ€™s three-year narco-war.
In 2007, there were more than 2,500 drug killings across Mexico and there have been more than 900 this year.
Baja California state police chief Daniel de la Rosa said fresh troops from Mexico City were arriving in Tijuana, which borders San Diego, California.
President Felipe Calderon has sent thousands of troops to Tijuana and Baja California state since taking office in December 2006.
Some 25,000 soldiers and federal police are deployed to fight cartels in drug hot spots across Mexico.
