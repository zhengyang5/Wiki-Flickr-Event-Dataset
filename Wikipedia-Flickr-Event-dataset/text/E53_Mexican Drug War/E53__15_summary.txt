By any reckoning, iron ore would seem like a daft thing to peddle if you were in the drugs trade.
Yet on March 3rd Mexican authorities seized nearly 120,000 tonnes of it near the port of L치zaro C치rdenas on the Pacific coast.
By some accounts, they also sent shipments of iron ore and other minerals to China themselves, including gold, which was hidden in containers.
With iron ore shipments from L치zaro C치rdenas rising to 4m tonnes last year from 1.5m previously, the bonanza was reckoned to be worth many millions of dollars.
This latest seizure of iron ore may represent the fag end of a dying criminal enterprise.
