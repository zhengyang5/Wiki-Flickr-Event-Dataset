Indeed, the Mexican state is in important ways both stronger and more successful than many Americans seem to realize.
In the area of public health, and, more broadly, in poverty reduction, Mexico has far more to teach than to learn.
If one takes the long view, the clash between the Mexico of Pemex and the Mexico of Homex may be as important as the war between the cartels and the government.
But the biggest downside to labeling Mexico a failed state may be that it allows us to ignore our own complicity in the countryâ€™s problems.
The danger is not that Mexico will become a failed state, but rather that the experience of this violence will somehow profoundly brutalize Mexican society.
