In 2010, the cartel wars in Mexico have produced unprecedented levels of violence throughout the country.
This resulted in Los Zetas being pushed back on their heels throughout the country, and by June it looked as if Los Zetas' days might be numbered.
However, a chain of events that began with the July 28 death of Sinaloa Federation No.
Two former heavyweights on the Mexican drug-trafficking scene have continued a declining trajectory in 2010: the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization/Juarez cartel (VCF) and the Arellano Felix Organization/Tijuana cartel (AFO).
Because of this, it is likely at some point that the Sinaloa Federation will begin to refuse to pay taxes to the AFO.
