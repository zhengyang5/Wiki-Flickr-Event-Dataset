Abstract: Drug Cartels in Mexico control approximately 70% of the foreign narcotics that flow into the United States. This poster session presents an overview of the major cartels and indentifies the areas of dispute. Extreme violence and social instability are the result. The focus will be on the dispute between the Juarez, Tijuana and Golfo cartels but an overview of other drug organizations will be also presented.
