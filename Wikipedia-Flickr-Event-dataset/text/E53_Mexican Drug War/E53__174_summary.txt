MEXICO CITY A small army of bloggers and tweeters is filling the gaps left by traditional media in Mexico that are increasingly limiting their coverage of the country's drug wars because of pressure from the cartels.
Tamaulipas is one of the most intense battlegrounds of the drug wars being fought in Mexico between the federal forces and at least seven cartels.
Six local journalists in one city disappeared in two days, and there was hardly a word from their terrified colleagues.
This reporting is not just the preserve of citizen journalists and frustrated reporters, all too aware that at least 30 Mexican journalists have been killed or disappeared since the drug wars began in December 2006.
“We just publish the information,” he wrote, adding that the blog sometimes receives 4m visits a week.
