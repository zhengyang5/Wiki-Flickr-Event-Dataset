Mexican drug cartels and their Colombian suppliers generate, launder and remove from the United States $18 billion to $39 billion each year, according to the National Drug Intelligence Center.

The Mexican government in June announced strict restrictions on cash deposits and withdrawals made in U.S. dollars.
