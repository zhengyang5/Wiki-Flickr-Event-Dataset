Drug Wars in Tamaulipas: Cartels vs. Zetas vs. the MilitaryFrontera NorteSurA long-simmering conflict between drug cartels exploded into violence in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, that borders Texas, last week.
Jaime Rodriguez Inurrigarro, Tamaulipas state attorney general, later denied that gun fights had broken out in the capital city.
Presumably authored by Los Zetas, narco-banners subsequently posted in Tamaulipas and four other states sarcastically challenged the purported alliance.
As last week's fighting unfolded, reports surfaced that members of Michoacan's La Familia drug cartel were sent to Tamaulipas to reinforce their allies in the Gulf Cartel.
Coming at a time when the Calderon administration has pledged to invest major resources in restoring order to Ciudad Juarez, the Tamaulipas violence represents a serious challenge to the Mexican state.
