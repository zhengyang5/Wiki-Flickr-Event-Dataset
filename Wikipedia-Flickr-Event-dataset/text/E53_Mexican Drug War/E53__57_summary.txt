IntroductionMexican authorities have been waging a bloody war against drug trafficking organizations for more than a decade with limited success.
Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are the largest foreign suppliers of heroin, methamphetamines, and cocaine to the United States, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
Mexican cartels are also leading manufacturers and suppliers of Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid many times more potent than heroin.
Mexicoâ€™s drug cartels are in a constant state of flux.
In Mexico, cartels have used vast drug profits to neutralize government opposition, paying off judges, police, politicians, and other officials.
