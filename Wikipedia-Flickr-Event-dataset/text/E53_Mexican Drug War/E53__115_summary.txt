At Mexico's Lone Gun Shop, Army Oversees SalesAccording to the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, there are roughly 54,000 licensed gun dealers in the U.S.
Mexico's lone gun shop is on a sprawling military compound in the capital that serves as the headquarters of the Mexican army.
It's sort of as if the only place in the United States to buy a gun was in a back office at the Pentagon.
Even someone near the U.S. border would have to travel here in person to legally buy a weapon.
Inside Mexico's only gun store, they actually have some of these weapons Franco refers to â€” in cabinets that are clearly marked "for government forces only."
