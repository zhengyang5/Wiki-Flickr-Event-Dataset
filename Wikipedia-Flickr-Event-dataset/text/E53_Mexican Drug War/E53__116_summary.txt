ATF officials were not immediately available for comment on the attorney general's statement.
Last April 13, Mexican police detained two Mexican suspects in the state of Baja California who were in possession of 192 inactive grenades, eight bullet-proof vests, and multiple firearm parts.
The two suspects detained in Baja California blew the whistle on another American citizen who was detained August 11 in Mexicali, Baja California.
That suspect, identified by the Mexican attorney general's office as Habib Sayb Mujica, is being held under a 40-day detention order issued by a judge.
Tuesday's statement from the attorney general's office said Mujica gave police information later used to capture Moinssonm in Mazatlan.
