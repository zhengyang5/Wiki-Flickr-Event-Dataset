Heriberto "The Executioner" Lazcano, head of the Zetas drug gang, is seen in this undated police handout file photo.
Just hours after he was killed, in a scene straight out of a movie, an armed group snatched Lazcano’s body and that of another Zetas member from the funeral parlor.
If Lazcano’s men took the body, it would not be the first time something of the kind has happened in Mexico’s drug war.
“Before this one, no president had taken on the drug gangs.
They’re fighting for people’s liberty against the government,” Rafael Benitez, a 21-year-old manual laborer in Mexico City, said of the Zetas.
