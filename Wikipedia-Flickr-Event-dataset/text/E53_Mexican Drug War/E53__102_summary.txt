In the meantime, the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) began to make their mark.
Added to this was a dispute over a distribution route in Chicago between the Sinaloa faction and the BLO.
Using their contacts in the federal government, the Sinaloa Cartel wore down the BLO.
Hector Beltran Leyva regrouped what remained of the BLO and began calling his operation the South Pacific Cartel (Cartel del Pacifico Sur).
However, the October 2014 arrest of the last Beltran Leyva brother still at large means that the BLO faces more challenging times ahead.
