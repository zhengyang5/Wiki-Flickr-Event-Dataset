SHARECitizens of the Mexican state of Michoacan woke on Thursday morning to banners hanging from bridges, monuments, and school gates proclaiming the emergence of a new group, the Knights Templar (Los Caballeros Templarios), who are apparently taking the place of the brutal Familia Michoacana cartel.
More than 30 signs, addressed to the people of Michoacan, declared the group’s intention to take over the “altruistic work” of the Familia.
The Knights Templar were a medieval military-religious order who defended pilgrims in the Holy Land, and were known both for their piety and for being bloodthirsty in battle.
A translation of the Knights Templar announcement is below.
Sincerely, The Knights Templar
