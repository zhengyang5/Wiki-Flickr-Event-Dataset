What's worse, the cartels have now forged alliances with American street gangs, giving these drug cartels a deep reach into American life.
The Mexican army patrolling the streets of the Mexican cities bordering the U.S. report that in the last several weeks, at least 50 criminals and drug traffickers arrested there were members of U.S. street gangs, Mexican cartel gangs and other traditional" prison gangs."
In addition to the "traditional" prison gangs, there are many other lesser known, but none the less dangerous, prison gangs.
A fierce rivalry developed between the two gangs and the Old Mexican Mafia, as well as Mexican Mafia members are subject to attack by the New Mexican Mafia members if they are placed in the prison population together.
The Old Mexican Mafia patterns itself after the organizational structure of the California Mexican Mafia, which includes as its leaders a General, Captains, Lieutenants, and soldiers.
