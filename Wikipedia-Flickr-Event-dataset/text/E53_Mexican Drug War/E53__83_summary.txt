The notoriously brutal leader of Mexico's feared Zetas drug cartel was captured in a pickup truck near the border city of Nuevo Laredo Monday, officials said, in what is the first major blow against an organized crime leader by a Mexican administration struggling to drive down persistently high levels of violence.
"The Drug Enforcement Administration congratulates the Government of Mexico on the arrest of Miguel Trevino Morales," the DEA said in a statement released Tuesday.
Trevino Morales is charged with ordering the kidnapping and killing of the 265 migrants, Sanchez said.
Trevino Morales is expected to be succeeded by his brother, Omar, a former low-ranking turf boss seen as far weaker than his older brother.
That same year, Trevino Morales and Lazcano began pushing for independence from the Gulf cartel after cartel head Osielo Cardenas Guillen's extradition to the U.S.
