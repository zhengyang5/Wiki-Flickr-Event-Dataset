While most of the world is losing its head over new Facebook UI changes, social networking users in Mexico are quite literally losing theirs for sharing information online about drug cartel activity.
The body was found on Saturday morning next to a warning note explaining why she had been killed.
She, like others, had taken to the networking site to post updates and news often censored by mainstream media who have been terrorized into submission by the various cartels.
"Nuevo Laredo en Vivo and social networking sites, I'm the Nena de Laredo, and I'm here because of my reports, and yours," read the note next to her headless body.
The signature Zâ€™s in the message appear to indicate that the murder was the work of the Zetas cartel.
