Mexican drug cartels have seen a business opportunity in the migrants: they are being systematically kidnapped en route, and held to ransom.
Often they have been killed, and Mexico is currently investigating a number of mass graves.
The northern Guatemalan department of Peten - an area through which many migrants cross to Mexico - is vulnerable.
This was apparently revenge for a drug debt, and the killers are believed to be Zetas - the bloodiest Mexican cartel.
Crossing Continents follows part of the migrants' route - from Peten in Guatemala, to the southern Mexican town of Tenosique.
