The propaganda video was sent to media outlets by the newest players in that conflict, the bizarrely named Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar).
Like La Familia, the Knights claim to be pious and patriotic protectors of the Michoac√°n community even as they traffic and murder.
This points to another key problem in Mexico's drug war: when cartel capos are taken down, their lieutenants battle for the crown.
Two weeks earlier, fighting between Knights and La Familia loyalists was so fierce that about 1,000 people temporarily fled their villages.
But one group is miffed about the new gang's name and fame: the official Knights Templar.
