Body count from mass graves in Mexico rises to 145Sixteen police officers are arrested for allegedly providing cover to drug-cartel gangsters suspected in the slayings.
The graves were found near the northern Mexico town of San Fernando, where the arrested officers worked.
All 145 of the bodies have been found in pits around the town of San Fernando, about 80 miles south of Brownsville, Texas, in Tamaulipas state.
The discovery of the Tamaulipas graves over the last week has horrified Mexicans already reeling from years of drug-war bloodshed.
San Fernando was also the site last summer of a massacre of 72 mostly Central American migrants believed slain by the Zetas.
