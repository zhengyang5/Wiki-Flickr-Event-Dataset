The Merida Initiative, proposed by Bush in October 2007, is significant for several reasons.
"This bill includes $465 million for the Merida Initiative, a partnership with Mexico and nations in Central America," Bush said at the signing ceremony.
Originally, the Merida Initiative legislation included a requirement to make Mexico's police operations more transparent and responsive to complaints, and to ensure investigations of reports of abuse.
The Merida Initiative includes funding for nonintrusive inspection equipment, ion scanners and canine units for Mexico and Central America to stop drugs, arms, cash and criminals.
