Nisman's report said Iran's intelligence activities in Latin America are being conducted directly by Iranian officials or through a key surrogate, the Hezbollah Islamic militant group.
From this base deep in the heart of South America, Hezbollah set up illicit enterprises to fund its operations in the Middle East and elsewhere, analysts say.
Security analyst Samuel Logan, the founding director of Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America, sees the same dynamic at work.
"Latin America is home to many Lebanese Shia migrants, but they have diverse religious and political orientations," Cammett testified.
Hezbollah has gained entry into Latin America through Iran, which has strengthened ties with Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua.
