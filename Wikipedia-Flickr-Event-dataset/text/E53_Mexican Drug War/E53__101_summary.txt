Silvano Aureoles, governor of the troubled western state of Michoacan, wrote on Twitter that the helicopter "was downed" during the operation in an area of rough terrain.
But hours later, he told the Televisa network that he "can't confirm that it was downed" and that authorities were investigating the cause of the crash.
The incident took place in Michoacan's Tierra Caliente, a region that has endured years of drug violence and vigilante justice.
If confirmed, it would be the second time that a gang downs a helicopter since 2015.
The pseudo-religious Knights Templar drug cartel terrorized Tierra Caliente until lime growers formed vigilante forces in 2013 to fight back against the gang.
