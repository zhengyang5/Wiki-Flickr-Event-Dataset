"Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters on her plane Wednesday as she flew to Mexico for an official visit.
In Colombia, I saw how the huge, brutally violent Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels threatened to turn the country into the world's first "narco-state."
Money from the drug trade sustains the longest-running leftist insurgency in the hemisphere.
And now Mexico has become the focal point of the drug trade, with its cartels blasting their way to dominance in the business of bringing marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs to the American market.
It's time to put everything on the table, because all we've accomplished so far is to bring the terrible violence of the drug trade ever closer to home.
