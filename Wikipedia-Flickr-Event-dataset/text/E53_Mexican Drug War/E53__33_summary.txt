In an extraordinary public airing of alleged police corruption, a Mexican general has identified several law enforcement officers whose criminal activities include kidnapping, drug smuggling and operating protection rackets.
Aponte, who heads the anti-drug offensive in Baja California, made the revelations in a letter published Wednesday in the Tijuana newspaper Frontera.
Aponte said corruption existed in every major Baja California city and extended from municipal departments to federal agencies.
There were many more corruption examples, Aponte wrote, but he couldn't fit them all in the newspaper.
"What a shame for the society of Baja California," Aponte wrote.
