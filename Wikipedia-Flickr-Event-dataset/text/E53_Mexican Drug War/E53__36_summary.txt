President Calderon has said that the United States demand for drugs fuels violence in Mexico.
It is clear that the availability of high-powered guns in the United States for Mexican criminals is hurting bilateral security.
We would hope to see an overwhelming response from the United States government to prevent these guns from getting into Mexico.
We have the Merida Initiative and the most important part of it is that it recognizes our [Mexico and the United States] shared responsibility.
We have also opened 330 drug rehabilitation centers and implemented drug prevention programs in 20,000 schools around the country.
