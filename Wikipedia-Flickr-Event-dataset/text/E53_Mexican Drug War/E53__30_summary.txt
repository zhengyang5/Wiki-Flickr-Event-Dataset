REUTERS/Roberto ArmentaMexican drug cartels control vast swaths of the US drug market, but that influence remains heavily slanted in favor of the vaunted Sinaloa cartel.
The Sinaloa cartel is the oldest cartel currently operating in Mexico, and it controls significant chunks of that country, particularly on the Pacific coast.
It's important to note that the Sinaloa cartel doesn't function quite like a traditional, hierarchical cartel.
The Sinaloa cartel is thought to control the majority of the US drug market.
According to the DEA's assessment, however, the amount of US territory controlled by Mexican cartels has shifted slightly from 2015 to 2016.
