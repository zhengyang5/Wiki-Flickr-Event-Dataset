President Felipe Calderon said Wednesday that Mexico's cartels in many cases have moved beyond drugs as their main money-earner and are even trying to supplant the government in parts of the country.
Speaking at an anti-crime conference, Calderon said gangs are imposing fees like taxes in towns they dominate, extorting money from both legitimate and unauthorized businesses.
"They are trying to impose a monopoly by force of arms, and are even trying to impose their own laws."
Calderon said cartels may even be taking money from churches.
"I do not doubt that they are also extorting money from priests and pastors in this country," he said.
