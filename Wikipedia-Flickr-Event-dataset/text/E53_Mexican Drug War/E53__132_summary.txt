While engaging in law enforcement activities, the armed forces have committed serious human rights violations, including killings, torture, and enforced disappearances.
One of the main reasons military abuses persist is because soldiers who commit human rights violations against civilians are almost never brought to justice.
Criminal Justice SystemThe criminal justice system routinely fails to provide justice to victims of violent crimes and human rights violations.
Women who have suffered human rights violations generally do not report them to authorities, while those who do report them are generally met with suspicion, apathy, and disrespect.
Human Rights DefendersHuman rights defenders continue to suffer harassment and attacks, sometimes directly at the hands of state officials.
