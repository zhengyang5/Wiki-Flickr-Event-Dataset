"We have received credible threats that the group 'The Zetas' are planning an attempt on the life of President Alvaro Colom," said Jesus Galeano of Guatemala's Secretariat of Strategic Intelligence.
The Zetas, who were founded in 1999 by 40 former soldiers who deserted from Mexican Special Forces, began as a death squad employed by the established Gulf Cartel.
But they have since evolved into a cocaine trafficking cartel in their own right and their threat to President Alvaro Colom suggests that they have ambitions to consolidate their hold of narcotics trafficking in neighbouring Guatemala.
But by then the Zetas had become the most deadly and disciplined force in the Mexican underworld.
They announced their arrival in Guatemala a year ago with a massacre in which 11 suspected drugs traffickers were killed in Zacapa, east of the capital, Guatemala City.
