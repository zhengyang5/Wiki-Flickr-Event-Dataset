Lawmakers from Arizona and New Mexico are ratcheting up their demands that the Obama administration deploy hundreds of National Guard troops and Border Patrol agents to the Mexican border after the killing of a prominent southeast Arizona rancher.
McCain called on the administration to "immediately" reconsider sending National Guard troops to the border.
"We must make the security of our borders one of our top national security priorities," he said.
Jan Brewer also renewed her calls for additional National Guard troops, calling the Krentz killing a "horrible and unnecessary tragedy."
Tancredo, in a statement through his Rocky Mountain Foundation, said the National Guard should be sent in to aid the Border Patrol.
