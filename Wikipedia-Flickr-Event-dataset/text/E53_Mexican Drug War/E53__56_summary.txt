The acts of narco-terrorism caused by the Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTO’s) have cost over 34,000 lives since 2006 in what has degenerated into an armed insurrection in many parts of Mexico.
Alliances have been formed with gangs in the United States.
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has committed thousands of troops from the Mexican Army to join the counter-narcotics operations of the Mexican law enforcement forces.
The Mexican DTO’s have responded by changing tactics into what amounts to an insurgency using asymmetric warfare to combat the Mexican government forces.
Recent incursions into the United States by Mexican DTO’s have increased concerns by law enforcement that this conflict could spill over into the United States.
