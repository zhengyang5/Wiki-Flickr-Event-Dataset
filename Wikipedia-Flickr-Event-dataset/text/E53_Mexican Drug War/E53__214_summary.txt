Why is Iran conspiring with Mexican drug dealers?
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for one, remarked, "The idea that [Iran] would attempt to go to a Mexican drug cartel to solicit murder-for-hire to kill the Saudi ambassador, nobody could make that up, right?"
Moreover, Iran and Hezbollahâ€™s ties to Mexican drug cartels are nothing new.
For years, they have been involved in drug smuggling and people smuggling in Mexico and across the U.S. border.
To be sure, trying to arrange the assassination of a foreign diplomat on U.S. soil represents an ominous turn in Iranian strategy against the United States.
