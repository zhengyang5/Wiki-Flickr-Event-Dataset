The cornerstone of Project Gunrunner is intelligence-led firearms trafficking investigations.
In September 2010, ATF announced plans to expand Project Gunrunner by opening additional Gunrunner offices in Sierra Vista, Arizona, and Brownsville, Texas.
These steps will allow for more timely and effective collaboration among the various law enforcement partners dedicated to Project Gunrunner.
Today, there are nearly 4,500 active Project Gunrunner investigations throughout the United States.
To date, Project Gunrunner investigations have resulted in the seizure of over 10,000 firearms and nearly one million rounds of ammunition destined for Mexico.
