The alliance with the Zetas is only the tip of the Iranian iceberg in Latin America.
The Zetas have shot their way to prominence ever since, in turf wars with other gangs and in a number of spectacular massacres.
This past August, the Zetas conducted a mounted raid on the Casino Royale–yes, the Casino Royale–in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon.
In addition to the Quds Force, Iran often operates through Hezbollah, which has established networks in the Lebanese communities that have long-standing enclaves in the trading and port cities of South America.
No one has tracked the increasing strategic cooperation between Iran, other anti-America states, international criminal, and narco-gangs than Douglas Farah of the International Assessment and Strategy Center.
