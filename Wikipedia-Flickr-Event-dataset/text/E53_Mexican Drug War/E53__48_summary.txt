About 12,000 people were slain last year in Mexico’s surging drug violence, according to grim tallies reported Monday by the country’s leading media outlets.
More than 50,000 people have been killed during President Felipe Calderon’s U.S.-backed military confrontation with organized crime and drug trafficking, which began in 2006.
La Jornada counted 11,890 deaths in 2011, which it says is an 11 percent decrease from the previous year.
In the Reforma count, the number of bodies that showed signs of torture grew to 1,079.
Reforma also found that women increasingly were victims of drug violence, with more than 900 slain last year.
