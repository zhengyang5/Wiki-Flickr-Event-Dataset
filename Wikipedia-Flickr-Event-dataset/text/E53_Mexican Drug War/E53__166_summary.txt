Abstract Aims To identify factors associated with receptive syringe sharing among injection drug users (IDUs) and elucidate the association between syringe possession arrests and syringe sharing.
Arrest for used syringe possession was also associated independently with receptive syringe sharing (AOR = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.76, 4.69).
Because of its cross-sectional design, we cannot establish definitively temporality between arrest for syringe possession and receptive syringe sharing.
increasing number of arrests for syringe possession was not associated with increased likelihood of receptive syringe sharing.
This study found a direct relationship between arrests for syringe possession and receptive syringe sharing among IDUs in two Mexican border cities.
