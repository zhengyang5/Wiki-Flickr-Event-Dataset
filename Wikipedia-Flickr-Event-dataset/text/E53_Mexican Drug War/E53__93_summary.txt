Mexican authorities say they gunned down notorious cartel leader Nazario Moreno Gonzalez on Sunday.
Critics said the Mexican government had never proven that Moreno had been slain after the 2010 announcement.
Cartel founder 'known for his dangerousness'Moreno -- nicknamed "The Craziest One," "El Chayo" and "The Doctor" -- was "known for his dangerousness," Rubido said Sunday.
On Sunday, Mexican authorities said fingerprint tests had confirmed that Moreno was really the one they killed this time.
'Spiritual leader'A Mexican government dossier released in 2010 described Moreno as the brains behind many killings.
