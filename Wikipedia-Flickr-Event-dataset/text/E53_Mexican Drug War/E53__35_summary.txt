Four Gunmen Die in Clash with Mexican TroopsMEXICO CITY Â– Four gunmen died in a battle with Mexican soldiers near a city just across the border from Brownsville, Texas, the defense department said.
The troops returned fire, killing four of the attackers, and seized one of the vehicles, a stolen SUV found to contain four rifles and 730 rounds of ammunition.
President Felipe Calderon, inaugurated in December 2006 for a six-year term, has deployed 50,000 soldiers and 20,000 federal police to a dozen Mexican states to battle the drug gangs.
His government has scored some high-profile victories against the cartels, including the killing of kingpin Arturo Beltran Leyva in December.
So far this year, drug-related violence has claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people, Mexico City daily El Universal says.
