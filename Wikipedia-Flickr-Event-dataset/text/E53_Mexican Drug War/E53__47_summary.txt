The growth rate of killings between September 2010 to September 2011 was 11%, compared with 70% between 2009 and 2010, the agency said.
Some 70% of the killings reported so far for 2011 happened in just eight states, the agency said.
But if the last quarter of 2011 averages the same number of killings as the first three quarters, then Mexico would surpass 17,000 deaths for the year, a new record.
Adding the new statistics, from the beginning of President Felipe Calderon's term in December 2006 to September 2011, at least 47,515 people have been killed in drug-related violence.
The statistics are broken down by state and municipality, which helps shed some light on the problem areas in Mexico.
