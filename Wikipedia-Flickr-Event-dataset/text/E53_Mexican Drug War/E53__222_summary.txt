With only approximately $1 billion seized per year, domestically, by all Federal agencies combined, no one can claim to have discovered the “holy grail" of drug financial investigations.
Accordingly, DEA “financial investigations” focus on identifying and interdicting those drug proceeds flowing back to the source of drug supply.
To ensure maximum effectiveness, DEA money flow investigations are designed to be compatible with, not competitive with, the long-term asset-tracing type investigations that have traditionally been the norm.
The FITs are not expected to conduct all DEA financial investigations.
As part of our strategy to employ regulatory measures against money laundering systems that facilitate drug money laundering, DEA works closely with the FinCEN and other law enforcement agencies.
