PrefaceThe National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) prepared the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment (NGTA) to examine emerging gang trends and threats posed by criminal gangs to communities throughout the United States.
Gang members on some Indian Reservations are associating with gang members in the community to commit crime.
Native American gang members on reservations are also involved in gang-related activity with gang members in communities outside of reservations.
Gang members have been reported in every branch of the US militaryn, although a large proportion of these gang members and dependent gang members of military personnel are affiliated with the US Army, Army Reserves, and National Guard branches.
