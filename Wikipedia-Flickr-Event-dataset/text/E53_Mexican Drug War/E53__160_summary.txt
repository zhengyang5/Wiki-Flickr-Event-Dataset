Education Is Latest Casualty In Mexico's Drug WarEnlarge this image toggle caption Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the coastal Mexican city of Acapulco, teachers are out on strike — not over wages, working conditions or pensions, but because of crime.
Over the last two years, drug cartels fighting for control of Acapulco have terrorized the once-popular tourist resort.
As Mexico's drug war drags on, and the government cracks down on narcotics trafficking, there's been a spike across the country in kidnapping, car theft and extortion.

Longtime residents of Acapulco say crime in what used to be one of Mexico's leading tourist resorts is out of control.
