The Sinaloa Cartel, along Mexico's Pacific coast, is reputedly led by fugitive Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, Mexico's most-wanted man.
While it's in better shape than the Gulf organization, the Sinaloa group until recently was allied with the Beltran Leyva and Juarez cartels (forming the Sinaloa Federation), but both have split off.

The Beltran Leyva Org­an­ization has become one of the most powerful drug traffickers in Mexico since splitting from the Sinaloa Federation in 2008.
Tourism has been battered over the past year – largely by swine flu but also by drug violence.
