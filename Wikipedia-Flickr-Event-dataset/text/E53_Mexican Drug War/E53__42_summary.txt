Over the course of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the number of civilian deaths has been staggering.
In Afghanistan, more than 26,000 civilians are estimated to have died since the war began in 2001.
In Iraq, conservative tallies place the number of civilians killed at roughly 160,500 since the U.S. invasion in 2003.
To be sure, the homicides documented in Mexico cannot all be linked directly to the drug war, and distinguishing drug-war violence from the raw totals can be fraught with challenges.
Some counts have blamed the drug war for as much as 55 percent of all homicides.
