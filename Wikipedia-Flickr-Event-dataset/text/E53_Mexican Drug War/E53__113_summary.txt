Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, aka "Ugly Betty," was captured in the western state of Nayarit, Notimex said.
The report did not describe the circumstances of his arrest, nor did it say when it happened.
Last month, Mexican authorities arrested Mario Armando Ramirez Trevino, a suspected leader of the country's Gulf Cartel.
Notimex reported that Carrillo Fuentes is the brother of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who died in 1997 as a result of undergoing plastic surgery to alter his appearance in an effort to avoid capture.
