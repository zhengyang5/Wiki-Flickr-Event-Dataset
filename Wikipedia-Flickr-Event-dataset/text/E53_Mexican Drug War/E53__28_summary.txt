Iron Triangle of Terror: Iran, Hezbollah, and Los Zetas?
On December 15 it was revealed in an indictment that Hezbollah has a substantial drug connection to the Mexican drug cartel Los Zetas.
The sheer volume of this transaction is cause for concern, but the fact that Hezbollah and Los Zetas are working together is far worse.
A blog post called “Debunking the Iran Terror Plot” may provide a counterpoint to the theory that Hezbollah and Los Zetas are coordinating.
Despite this there are no conclusive links to show an iron triangle between Iran, Hezbollah, and Los Zetas.
