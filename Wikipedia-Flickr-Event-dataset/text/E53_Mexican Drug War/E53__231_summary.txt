Shortly after taking office in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderón dispatched the military to tackle the drug trafficking organizations’ operations head on.
Since then, roughly 45,000 soldiers and 5,000 federal police have been deployed to eight Mexican states to strengthen Mexico’s counternarcotic law-enforcement capabilities.
The extradition had the unintended countereffect of unleashing a turf war and power struggle among the major Mexican drug cartels.
What is also needed is an actual commitment in the United States to reduce domestic demand for drugs.
Until the United States manages to reduce its drug consumption levels, drug trafficking organizations are simply going to find another way to get their drugs to the lucrative U.S. market.
