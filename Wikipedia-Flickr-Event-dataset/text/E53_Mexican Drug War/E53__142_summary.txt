Mexico says the leader of the feared Zetas drug cartel has been been killed in a firefight with soldiers in the northern Mexican border state of Coahuila.
The navy said fingerprints taken from the body before the corpse was taken away have matched the records of Lazcano, known as El Lazca, confirming his death.
Al Jazeera's Adam Raney, reporting from Mexico City, said it appeared the government may have been "embarrassed" by the loss of Lazcano's body.
The US had offered a $5m reward and Mexico an additional $2.3m for information leading to Lazcano's arrest.
Jose Luis Vergara, Mexican navy spokesman, said Salvador Alfonso Martinez Escobedo was arrested on Saturday in Nuevo Laredo, across from Laredo in the US state of Texas.
