MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexicoâ€™s attorney general said on Friday fewer drug-related killings at home and rising narcotics prices in the United States showed his government is winning the war against cartels.
Cocaine and methamphetamine prices are rising across 8,000 U.S. towns and cities and purity is falling, showing fewer drugs are getting into the United States, he added.
Mexico is the main smuggling route for South American cocaine into the United States.
Mexican kingpins dominate the international drug trade, also shipping synthetic drugs from Asia and home-grown marijuana into U.S. and European markets.
Turf wars between cartels in Mexico vying for control of the lucrative drug trade have killed more than 1,600 people this year and some 2,000 people in 2006.
