Image caption The fight against drugs is exacting a heavy tollMore than 30,000 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon took office four years ago, the government says.
Almost 12,500 have been killed so far this year, a sharp increase on 2009.
Mexico's attorney-general said the number of deaths was "regrettable", but showed that the security forces were having success in their fight against the drugs gangs.
President Calderon has sent thousands of troops to battle the cartels.
The border city of Ciudad Juarez alone has seen 3,000 killings so far this year, ten times more than in 2007.
