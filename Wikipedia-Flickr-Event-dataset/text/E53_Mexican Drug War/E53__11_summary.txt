SHAREAuthorities captured an alleged link between Colombia trafficking organization the Rastrojos and Mexico drug cartels in Panama.
The suspect had been granted political asylum in Panama, underscoring the diverse networks and reach maintained by the Rastrojos and their Mexican counterparts.
Alex Antonio Moreno Delgadillo, alias “Alex Caballo,” was arrested in Panama City, where he had been living since 2011.
According to Colombian police, Alex Caballo acted as the Rastrojos’ link to Mexican cartels, among them the Zetas.
Police comments about the arrest of Alex Caballo would suggest the Rastrojos continue to work with more than one cartel in Mexico, maintaining diverse networks and staying out of Mexico’s internal turf disputes.
