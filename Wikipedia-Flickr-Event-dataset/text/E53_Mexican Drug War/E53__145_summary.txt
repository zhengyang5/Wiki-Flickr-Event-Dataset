But adding to the confusion, two Mexican newspapers reported the next morning that the corpse had suddenly gone missing.
First, there should be no question that this is a big victory for the Mexican navy/marines and the Calderón administration.
Calderón can say one of the founders and top leaders of Los Zetas was killed on his watch, and this will no doubt be a big morale booster for the military.
But we do know that Miguel "Z-40" Treviño Morales, the Zetas' #2 man, in effect took control of Los Zetas some time ago.
However, it also means Los Zetas aren't significantly weaker as an organization as a result.
