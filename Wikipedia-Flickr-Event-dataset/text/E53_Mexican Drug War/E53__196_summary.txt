Analyst warns failed state in Guatemala could augur drug cartel domination of Central America.
US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Janet Napolitano reported a rare piece of good news late last week in the battle against runaway drug cartel violence on the Southern border.
The seizure was part of the major transnational cooperative effort to combat international drug smuggling and deter drug-related violence along the US-Mexico border.
“Over the past several weeks, we have stepped up our efforts to stop Southwest border violence at its source—the trafficking of drugs, guns and cash,” declared Secretary Napolitano.
“In fact, the experts may have missed their target by little, for the term would have been better employed in describing neighboring Guatemala.” Guatemala has long been a crucial transit point for north-bound narcotics.
