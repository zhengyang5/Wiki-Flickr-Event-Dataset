Mexico cracks down on violence Troops sent to state terrorized by drug killingsMEXICO CITY -- Mexico's new government announced Monday that it was sending more than 6,500 soldiers, marines and federal police to the western state of Michoacan to crack down on a wave of execution-style killings and beheadings that have left hundreds dead.
Federal investigators say the violence in Michoacan, Calderon's home state, stems from a turf war between a local gang called Los Valencia and the northern Mexico Gulf cartel, whose bloody enforcers are known as the Zetas, a group of ex-Mexican army operatives turned hit men.
About half of Michoacan's more than 500 killings this year are linked to the turf war, investigators say.
Security officials said police and soldiers will arrest drug traffickers, mount checkpoints and burn crops of marijuana and opium poppies grown in Michoacan's rugged mountains.
Naval ships also will seal off the state's small Pacific coast, along which smugglers carry drugs on their way north to the United States.
