Authorities investigate the tunnel that Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman used to escape from a maximum-security prison.
Now a massive manhunt is underway to find Guzman, Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto said.
He vowed that his government would recapture Guzman, step up prison security and investigate whether any prison workers helped the kingpin break out.
'The world's most powerful drug lord'Guzman heads the Sinaloa Cartel, which the U.S. Justice Department describes as "one of the world's most prolific, violent and powerful drug cartels."
It says Guzman was "considered the world's most powerful drug lord until his arrest in Mexico in February 2014."
