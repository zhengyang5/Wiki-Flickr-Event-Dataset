MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities were searching Wednesday for two politicians accused of belonging to the Familia Michoacana drug cartel, which is blamed for killing more than 30 federal police officers in a series of attacks since Saturday.
Drug violence is up in Michoacan state, shown by recent attacks on police in at least a half-dozen cities.
Authorities also said they are searching for Saul Solis Solis, alias "El Lince," who lost his bid for a congressional seat this month.
Solis sought election as a member of the Green Ecological Party of Mexico.
