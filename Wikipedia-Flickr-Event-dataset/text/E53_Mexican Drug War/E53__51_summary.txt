Mexico has recorded its most violent year on record, after at least 23,000 people were murdered in 2017.
That means that on average, one death was reported in Mexico every 20 minutes over the past year.
The staggering figure - the highest since the country began keeping records two decades ago - is being blamed on corruption, a weak judiciary and violent drug cartels.
Mario Gonzalez Roman, an expert on security, trafficking and crime in Mexico, told Al Jazeera he was "not surprised" by the increase in deaths, however.
"This is the result of a failed policy," Gonzalez Roman told Al Jazeera.
