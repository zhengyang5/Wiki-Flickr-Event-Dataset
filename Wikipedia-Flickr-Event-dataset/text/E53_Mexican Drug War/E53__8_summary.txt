Loya Castro stated he had informed the Mexican attorney of his intention to meet with DEA agents and U.S. prosecutors.
Loya Castro reported that the Mexican attorney advised Loya Castro to cancel the meeting.
Loya Castro said that the Mexican attorney expressed fear that Loya Castro would say something to jeopardize defense counsel’s strategy.
