Over the past year, an uprising of armed citizens has taken on a powerful drug gang and pushed them back.
The drug gang in this conflict is unusual, even by Mexican standards.
They formed self-defense groups, took up arms and started killing the gangsters.
Global Post reporter Dudley Althaus has spent much of the week with the self-defense groups in Michoacan.
"To some extent, what this shows is the weakness of Mexican institutions; of Mexican law enforcement and criminal justice institutions," he says.
