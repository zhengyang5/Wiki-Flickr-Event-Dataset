This study examined barriers to over-the-counter (OTC) syringe purchase among IDUs in Tijuana, Mexico.
Factors independently associated with refusal/overcharging were homelessness, receptive syringe sharing, >5 uses per syringe, and number of lifetime abscesses.
IDUs reported syringe sharing, syringe reuse, and searching through unsecured medical waste for syringes in response to failed purchase attempts.
Although HIV prevalence remains somewhat low among Tijuanaâ€™s IDUs syringe sharing is common, with 59% reporting receptive syringe sharing in the past 6 months [ 27 ].
Finally, we found that experiencing barriers to syringe purchase is associated with higher odds of syringe reuse and abscesses.
