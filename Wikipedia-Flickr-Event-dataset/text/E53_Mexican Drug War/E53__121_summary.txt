This means that almost 90 percent of the guns seized in Mexico in 2008 were not traced back to the United States.
Still, the numbers do not indicate that 90 percent of guns in this category come from the United States.
They are also dangerous to obtain in the United States due to heavy law enforcement scrutiny.
As noted above, China has become an increasingly common source for military weapons like grenades and fully automatic assault rifles in recent years.
To really understand Mexico's gun problem, however, it is necessary to recognize that the same economic law of supply and demand that fuels drug smuggling into the United States also fuels gun smuggling into Mexico.
