PHOENIX - Weapons linked to a questionable government strategy are turning up in crimes in Valley neighborhoods.
We’ve discovered assault weapons linked to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ controversial "Fast and Furious" case strategy have turned up at crime scenes in Glendale and Phoenix communities.
THE HISTORYPhoenix ATF agents recently testified during a Congressional hearing that they knowingly allowed weapons to slip into the hands of straw buyers who would then distribute the weapons to known criminals.
One of the recovered weapons, another Romarm/Cugir WASR-10 rifle, appeared in an official ATF Suspect Gun Summary document in February 2010.
ATF documents show the weapon had been entered into the ATF Suspect Gun Database in January 2010.
