David Michael Hartley is another American who is presumed to have been killed in Mexico.
Yet, as the Hartley case gained national notoriety, it seems as though Torres’ death and many others were forgotten, said Congressman Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo.
According to the U.S. Department of State, 92 Americans have been reported as victims of homicide in Mexico from June 2009 to June 2010.
Cuellar said it’s a shame that all cases aren’t treated with the same seriousness and aggressiveness as the Hartley case.
The death of Hartley gained national coverage when his wife, Young-Hartley began calling on American officials to do something to help her.
