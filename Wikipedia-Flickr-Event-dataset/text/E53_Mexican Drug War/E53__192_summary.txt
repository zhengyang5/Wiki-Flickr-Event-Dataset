By Sarah GraingerGUATEMALA CITY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Guatemala, scarred by years of civil war and rampant street gang crime, is suffering a new scourge as violent Mexican drug traffickers put down deep roots in the country.
"They are moving in because Guatemala is a paradise for drug traffickers.
Scores of Mexican traffickers are operating in Guatemala, including members of the Sinaloa cartel run by top fugitive Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman and the rival Gulf cartelâ€™s armed "Zetas" wing, officials say.
Guatemala has also arrested dozens of drug suspects and torched huge marijuana and poppy fields, but is struggling.
The U.S. government has sent speedboats and night-vision goggles under a regional drug aid package, but much more is needed.
