A total of 34,612 people have died in drug-related killings in Mexico in the four years since President Felipe Calderón declared an offensive against cartels shortly after taking office, officials said tonight.
Killings reached their highest level in 2010, when there were 15,273 deaths, up from 9,616 the previous year.
About half the killings took place in three northern states: Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas.
Poire said drug-related killings peaked in the third quarter of 2010 and declined by almost 11% in the fourth quarter.
La Familia cartel is based in the western state of Michoacán, but apparently has ties with traffickers in northern border states.
