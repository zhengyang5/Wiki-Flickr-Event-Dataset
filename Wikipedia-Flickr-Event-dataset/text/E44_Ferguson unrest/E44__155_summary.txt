On August 9th Mr Brown was shot several times and killed by a policeman in Ferguson, a suburb near St Louis, Missouri.
On August 13th a man pointed a gun at a police officer, who then shot and injured the gunman.
The shooting comes not long after Eric Garner, another black man, was killed during a choke-hold arrest in New York.
But since local police departments are not obliged to keep detailed statistics, it is hard to discern the national picture, says David Klinger of the University of Missouri, St Louis.
The FBI is investigating the Ferguson shooting, and the Justice Department is looking into the possibility that Mr Brownâ€™s civil rights were violated.
