Civil Rights Attorneys Sue Ferguson Over 'Debtors Prisons'In a new challenge to police practices in Ferguson, Mo., a group of civil rights lawyers is suing the city over the way people are jailed when they fail to pay fines for traffic tickets and other minor offenses.

He ran a background check and saw an arrest warrant for multiple unpaid traffic tickets in Ferguson.
