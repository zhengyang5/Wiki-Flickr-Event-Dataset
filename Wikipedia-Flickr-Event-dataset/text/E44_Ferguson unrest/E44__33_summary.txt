CLOSE Two reporters were arrested inside of a McDonald's when police clad in riot gear tried to clear the premises.
As a protest escalated, officers in riot gear moved in to close a McDonald's restaurant where reporters were writing and charging cellphones.
Lowery tweeted, "Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of."
Los Angeles Times reporter Matt Pearce tweeted that when he contacted Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson and asked about the arrests of the reporters, Jackson responded, "Oh God."
Pearce said he spoke to the chief a second time and Jackson said he asked the riot command to release the reporters.
