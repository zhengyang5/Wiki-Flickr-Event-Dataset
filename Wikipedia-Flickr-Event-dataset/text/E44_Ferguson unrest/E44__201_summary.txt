North Korea, however, had remained silent on the subject – until today.
The U.S. has "suffered disgrace" from Ferguson, KCNA says, and become "a laughing stock of the world."
In February, a United Nations report on human rights in North Korea concluded that the country was committing human rights violations “without any parallel in the contemporary world.” Months later (as with the Ferguson coverage, there was a significant lag), KCNA released its own list of "human rights abuses" by the United States.
Still, that doesn't mean that the criticisms of America's human rights record are without merit.
This may be one rare instance where many people in the U.S. actually agree with North Korea.
