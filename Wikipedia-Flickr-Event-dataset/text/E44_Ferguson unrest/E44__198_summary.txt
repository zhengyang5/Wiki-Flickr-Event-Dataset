Egypt's Foreign Ministry Spokesman said on Tuesday Ban's aforementioned statements "reflect the international community's stance on the matter."
He added that Egypt is closely following up with the "mounting protests" in Ferguson.
The highest death toll of last summer's violence was reported on August 14, following the forcible dispersal of two pro-Mursi camps in Greater Cairo; the Rabaa al-Adawiya and Nahda sit-ins.
The sit-ins' dispersal alone left at least 817 protesters killed, according to an HRW death toll provided in the report.
Official figures meanwhile put the death toll at 627.
