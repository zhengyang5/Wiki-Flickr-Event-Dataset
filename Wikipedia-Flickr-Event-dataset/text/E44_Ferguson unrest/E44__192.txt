Dozens of people gathered Sunday in downtown St. Louis in a show of support for the police officer involved in the controversial shooting of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Mo., while protests continued in the suburb about 12 miles away.

The Guardian reports about 150 people gathered as a show of solidarity with Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown during an encounter on Aug. 9:

"He was doing his job," said Kaycee Reinisch, 57, of Lincoln County, Missouri. "And now because of public uproar in Ferguson, he is being victimized. He is being victimized by the whole city, the state and the federal government." Reinisch said she had relations in law enforcement who would be "frightened to do their jobs" if Wilson were punished for the incident.

Those at the rally held signs and signed posters in support of Wilson, reports KSDK Channel 5 in St. Louis. A two-person counter-protest was held across the street.

Some supporting Wilson were selling T-shirts for $7 each with a police badge on the front and the saying "Officer Darren Wilson, I stand by you", according to the Telegraph. More from the Telegraph:

A man who would give his name only as Randy said the demonstration was not about picking sides but about showing support for officers doing a difficult job. "There are enough law enforcement groups investigating and that will take time," he said as passing cars honked their horns. "The police have a job to do and many people do not understand how hard it is." All were concerned about the risk to Wilson's family after his house was pictured on a local TV station, KSDK.

KSDK reported the rally was organized by the Support Darren Wilson Facebook page, which has more than 19,000 likes.

Meanwhile, on Saturday Yahoo! News published a photo of Wilson receiving a commendation six months ago for "extraordinary effort in the line of duty".
