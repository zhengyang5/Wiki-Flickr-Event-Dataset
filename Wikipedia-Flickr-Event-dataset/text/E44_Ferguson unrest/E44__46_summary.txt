gathered on Wednesday for another round of protests over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager who was killed over the weekend by a police officer.
Mr. Brown’s death has triggered days of protests that have brought national attention to racial tension between the police and the African-American community in the St. Louis suburb.
A man narrating the video said the protest was peaceful and the attack was unprovoked.
Fox 2 St. Louis, the local television station, shared a similar video clip.
By nightfall, the scene had grown tense as protesters refused to comply with the police’s demands that they leave the streets, and the police responded with force.
