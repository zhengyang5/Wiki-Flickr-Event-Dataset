But unlike the violence that erupted in Ferguson on Monday night, the protests across the country Tuesday night were largely peaceful.
"Now it's not clear where we're going," said CNN's Miguel Marquez, who was interviewing protesters as they continued marching after midnight.
And demonstrators gathered outside of the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, Officer Sara Faden said.
Some protesters had also gathered outside CNN Center.
Martin Luther King Jr., also saw emotional reaction Monday night when about 200 students gathered at Morehouse College to hear the grand jury's decision.
