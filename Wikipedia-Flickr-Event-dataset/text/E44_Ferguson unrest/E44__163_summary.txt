St. Louis Municipal Court on Monday cancelled 222,000 arrest warrants for traffic offenses after the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson exposed systemic disparities in local law enforcement.
The warrants were automatically eliminated and offenders will now have three months to get a new court date to face those previous charges, according to the city.
The killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri uncovered a regional criminal justice system rife with inequality and vast racial disparities.
As recently as earlier this year, the municipal court established a week in which people with warrants for non-violent ordinance violations to receive a new court date rather than be arrested.
People will have until Dec. 31 to get a new court date.
