Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly Wednesday, President Barack Obama cited the racial strife in Ferguson, Missouri, as an example of where America has "failed to live up to our ideals."
Obama was giving a much-anticipated address on global leadership, where he laid out his justification for the United States targeting terrorists in Syria and Iraq.
Ferguson made international news after a white police officer shot Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, on Aug. 9.
"America is not the same as it was 100 years ago, 50 years ago, or even a decade ago," he added.
Attorney General Eric Holder visited Ferguson last month, and the Department of Justice has been conducting an independent investigation into Brown's death.
