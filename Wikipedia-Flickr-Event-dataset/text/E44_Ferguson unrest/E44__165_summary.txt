The agency manager in Kansas City then asked a St. Louis County police official if the restrictions could be lessened so nearby commercial flights would not be affected.
“I have no problem with that whatsoever.”Brian Thouvenot, the news director at KMOV-TV in St. Louis, told The A.P.
“Only relief aircraft operations under direction of St. Louis County Police Department are authorized in the airspace,” the notice said.
Brian Schellman, a county police spokesman, denied that the no-fly zone was to prevent news helicopters from covering the events.
The flight restrictions remained in place until Aug. 22, federal records show.
