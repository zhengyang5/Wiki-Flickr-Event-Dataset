Remarkable footage from St. Louis station KSDK shows a SWAT team in Ferguson, Missouri, overnight firing tear gas at a TV camera crew from Al-Jazeera, then dismantling the crew's equipment after they've fled.

Police in Ferguson arrested two reporters and a St. Louis alderman Wednesday night, reportedly for being too slow to leave a McDonald's in the first case and getting out of a car in the second.
