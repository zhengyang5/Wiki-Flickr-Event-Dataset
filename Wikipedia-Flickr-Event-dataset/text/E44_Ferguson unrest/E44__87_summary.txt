The St. Louis police have said Mr. Myers used a stolen handgun to fire on the officer, but Mr. Myers’s supporters have said he was not carrying a weapon.
“We will close this place until our demands are met,” Kennard Williams, the protest’s leader, said.
“We will, I promise you, be listening to you,” Mr. Rainford told Mr. Williams.
“You will be part of the discussion and part of the debate.”Mr. Williams said protests would resume at City Hall if municipal officials did not agree to the demonstrators’ requests.
As night fell, more demonstrations took place at three Walmart stores, at a National Football League game in St. Louis and outside a political fund-raiser for a county executive candidate.
