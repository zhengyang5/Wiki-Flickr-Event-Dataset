In the past month, four unarmed black men, one as young as 18, who were murdered by police have made the headlines.
A healthy response by the local police and government agencies in Ferguson and St. Louis County would have been to immediately announce a full investigation of the shooting and a review of police policies and practices.
Instead, the response by police in Ferguson has been to inflict greater trauma and instigate anger.
Last night, the police aggressively cleared the streets and shops and kettled residents, preventing them from getting to their cars.
Counseling of officers who experience PTSD and testing and treatment for anabolic steroid abuse would also be helpful.
