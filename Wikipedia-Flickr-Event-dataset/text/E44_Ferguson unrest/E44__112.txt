Ferguson, MO (NNCNOW.com) -- Two police officers are in serious condition after they were shot while standing in front of the Ferguson Police Department just after midnight Thursday morning.

The officers, one from St. Louis County and the other from Webster Groves, were rushed to Barnes-Jewish Hospital for treatment and are listed in serious condition.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters outside the hospital at least three shots were fired, and the officers were targeted.

"I would have to make an assumption right now that based on the fact that these officers were standing together, and there were several officers standing right there when this happened, that these were shots that were parallel to the ground, not up in the air, they weren't skip shots. And I would have to make an assumption that these shots were directed exactly at my police officers," said Belmar.
