Three Missouri police officers are off the force in the wake of the Ferguson protests.
One, who was filmed pointing a rifle at journalists while threatening to gun them down, has resigned.
Officer Matthew Pappert of Glendale was fired Thursday after writing that Ferguson protestors should be 'put down like rabid dogs,' on Facebook.
