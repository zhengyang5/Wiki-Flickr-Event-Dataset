Protesters observed a minute's silence before marching down Oxford Street and making their way to Parliament Square.
They were joined by Carole Duggan, whose nephew Mark was shot dead by a Met police officer in 2011.
Ms Duggan told the crowd on Wednesday evening "we know the pain of losing somebody at the hands of the police".
She went on: "They've come to a point in Ferguson where there is no turning back.
It follows the decision not to charge white police officer Darren Wilson with the death of Michael Brown who was shot dead on 9 August in Ferguson.
