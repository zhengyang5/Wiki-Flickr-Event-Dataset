More than a week after Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, protests have been marred by confrontations with police, looting and violence.
The grand jury will hear testimony from witnesses and decide whether to return an indictment against Wilson, McGee said Monday.
Officials were working to line up witnesses but he wasn't sure if that would be done by Wednesday, he said.
He was briefly taken to the hospital following the confrontation with Brown for treatment of an injury that left his face swollen, according to Jackson.
The family and critics of the department have accused police of trying to damage Brown's character.
