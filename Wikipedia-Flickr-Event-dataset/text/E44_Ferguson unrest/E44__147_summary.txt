-- St. Louis County election officials say an error led them to significantly overstate the number of newly registered voters following the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black teenager.
That's a far cry from the 3,287 new Ferguson voters the county reported last week, according to CBS station KMOX in St. Louis.
The killing sparked weeks of civil unrest, and some activists led voter registration drives in an attempt to reshape local government.
2010 Census Bureau statistics show that two-thirds of the people who live in Ferguson are black.
The grand jury investigating the Brown case has six white men, three white women, two black women and one black man.
