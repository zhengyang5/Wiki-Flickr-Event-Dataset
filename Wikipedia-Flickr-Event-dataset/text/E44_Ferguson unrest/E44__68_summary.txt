Mr Holder has promised a "full, fair and independent" investigation into the killing of Mr Brown, 18, who was unarmed when he was shot.
Reports suggest that Mr Holder is considering opening a broader investigation into policing in Ferguson in general, following several allegations of police misconduct.
The New York Times reports that under Mr Holder, the justice department has ordered more than twice as many such department-wide investigations as before.
