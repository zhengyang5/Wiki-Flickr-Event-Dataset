There will be no curfew in Ferguson, Mo., on Monday night, Gov. Jay Nixon (D) announced Monday.

This news comes two days after he first said a curfew would be put in place between midnight and 5 a.m., which he described as an attempt to restore peace after two nights of intensifying clashes between residents and police in Ferguson.

The decision comes after Nixon had announced early Monday that the Missouri National Guard was being called in to help secure the city.

“With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard,” Nixon said in a statement.

The National Guard will operate in Ferguson under the command of the highway patrol. On Thursday, after days of standoffs that were becoming increasingly tense as tear gas and rubber bullets were fired at protesters, Nixon had placed the highway patrol in charge of security in Ferguson.

For the first night after the highway patrol took command, hugs and calm replaced tear gas and fear on the streets of Ferguson. But that did not last, with protests, looting and tear gas returning the following night.

On Saturday, Nixon announced the curfew. But on Saturday night and again on Sunday night, there were standoffs between police and residents. On Sunday night, a violent outburst erupted hours before the curfew was set to take effect, with police reporting multiple shots fired and residents and protesters again encountering tear gas and threats from police officers.
