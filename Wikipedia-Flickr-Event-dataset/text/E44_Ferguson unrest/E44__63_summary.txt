(Reuters) - Missouri Governor Jay Nixon lifted the curfew for the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on Monday and began deploying National Guard troops to help quell days of rioting and looting spurred by the fatal shooting of a black unarmed teenager by a white policeman.
REUTERS/Joshua LottNixon, who had declared a state of emergency for the town on Saturday and ordered that the streets be cleared for a curfew that ran from midnight to 5 a.m., said the National Guard would fall under the supervision of the Missouri Highway Patrol.
But retired local business owner Marshall Tucker said: “It ain’t getting no better with the National Guard coming in.
President Barack Obama said he told the governor that the National Guard use should be limited and urged healing instead of violence.
“Moreover, at my direction, an additional medical examination is being performed on the body of Michael Brown,” Holder said.
