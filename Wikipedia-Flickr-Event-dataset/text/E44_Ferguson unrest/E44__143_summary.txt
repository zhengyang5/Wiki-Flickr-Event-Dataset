(Reuters) - The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, the site of a year of occasionally violent protests over the police killing of an unarmed black teen, will remain under a state of emergency for at least another night, county officials said on Wednesday.
Young men wait to see to see what happens during another night of demonstrating in Ferguson, Missouri, August 12, 2015.
“I am pleased to report our law enforcement officers have established order while preventing further acts of violence in Ferguson,” said County Executive Steve Stenger, in a statement.
Police shot and critically wounded an 18-year-old black teen they said had fired at them during Sunday night’s protests, when windows of businesses along the commercial stretch were smashed.
Others in Ferguson have said he might not have realized that he was firing on plainclothes police officers.
