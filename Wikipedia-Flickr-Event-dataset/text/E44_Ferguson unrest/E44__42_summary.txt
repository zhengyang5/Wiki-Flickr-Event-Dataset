Edgartown, Massachusetts12:49 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, everybody.
We also knew that ISIL terrorists were killing and enslaving Yezidi civilians in their custody, and laying siege to the mountain.
Without food or water, they faced a terrible choice -- starve on the mountain, or be slaughtered on the ground.
Over the last week, the U.S. military conducted humanitarian air drops every night â€“- delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water.
Our military was able to successfully strike ISIL targets around the mountain, which improved conditions for civilians to evacuate the mountain safely.
