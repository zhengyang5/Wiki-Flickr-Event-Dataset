ISIS radicals and their supporters are hoping that social media will encourage protestors in Ferguson to embrace Islamic radicalism and rebel against the U.S. government.

Jihadists in Syria and Iraq and their sympathizers in the west have voiced their support via Twitter for the hundreds of people who have taken part in protests following the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown. Using the hashtag #FergusonUnderISIS, the group is attempting to get young men in Ferguson to join the Islamist group.

Twitter user Amreeki Witness has led the pack of western ISIS supporters on the social media platform. He claims to be from Minneapolis-St. Paul, but says he is based in “the horn of Africa”. One tweet reads: “So how is democracy treating you guys? #FergusonUnderIS #Ferguson.”

Other tweets served more as a call to arms, encouraging other ISIS supporters to converge on Ferguson. Amreeki said, “May be time to organize the Muslims in America upon haqq and mobilize to #Ferguson. Defend the oppressed, start jihad here.” This tweet drew a large response with an Islamist who called himself Amarka Al-Ahlam replying: “Preach, brother. We must organize brigades in preparation for the oncoming storm. #FergusonUnderIS #JihadinFerguson.”
