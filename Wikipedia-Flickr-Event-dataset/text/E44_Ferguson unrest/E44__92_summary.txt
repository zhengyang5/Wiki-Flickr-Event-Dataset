NEW YORK -- Trey Yingst, a journalist arrested during November protests in Ferguson, Missouri, has settled a civil rights lawsuit filed against St. Louis County and the commanding officer involved in the incident.
"We are gratified that St. Louis County acknowledges that they should never have been arrested."
The St. Louis County Police Department, however, tweeted after the incident that Yingst was detained for “failure to disperse” and had “refused” orders from commanding officers to leave the street.
In the police department’s account, Yingst was standing in the street with protesters and impeding the flow of traffic when ordered to move to the sidewalk.
Yingst said he was shocked by the police report, which to him raised the troubling question of how others arrested in Ferguson may have been treated.
