Nearly a week after the shooting, police said Brown was the primary suspect in a robbery that occurred just before the shooting. Hours after releasing that information, Ferguson's police chief said Wilson did not know Brown was a robbery suspect, but stopped him because he was walking in the middle of the street. The police chief later said Wilson was aware that cigars had been taken in the robbery of a store nearby, but did not know Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, might be suspects. The chief said Wilson then saw cigars in Brown's hand and realized it might be connected. Police said Brown did have stolen items with him.
