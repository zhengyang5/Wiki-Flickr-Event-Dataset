-- After police vehicles pulled up beside demonstrators here overnight, most protesters and observers who had gathered at a local intersection were just watching and waiting.
Soon after this activity began, another group of demonstrators congregated by the door of the market, with others posted at different locations nearby, in an attempt to keep the looters out.
As time went on, the storeâ€™s guard team began to wear thin, eventually dwindling down to nobody.
Witnesses say the looting activity moved away from the police line and down West Florissant Street, possible to a nearby Wal-Mart store.
Meanwhile, the door to Ferguson Market remained wide open, and a handful of looters made their way in, one at a time.
