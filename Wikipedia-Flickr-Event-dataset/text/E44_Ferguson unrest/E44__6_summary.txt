Just about every branch of Ferguson government -- police, municipal court, city hall -- participated in "unlawful" targeting of African-American residents such as Hoskin for tickets and fines, the Justice Department concluded this week.
Justice Department laid out statistics to support their accusations of civil rights violations.
Officers competed "to see who could issue the largest number of citations during a single stop," the Justice Department said.
A fine for "weeds/tall grass" was $5 in one nearby city, but Ferguson's fine ranged from $77 to $102, the Justice Department found.
Defendants have been required to pay an entire fine at once, regardless of ability to pay, the federal report said.
