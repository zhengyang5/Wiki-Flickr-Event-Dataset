A veteran Miami police officer with two decades of experience dealing with the news media and community leaders will take over as police chief, hoping to help this St. Louis suburb heal after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014.

The hiring of the officer, Maj. Delrish Moss, 51, was announced Thursday. It put a black man in charge of a mostly white department that serves a town where African-Americans make up two-thirds of the residents.

“We understand the past 18 months have not been easy for everyone, but the city is now moving forward and we are excited to have Major Moss lead our police department,” Mayor James Knowles III said in a statement.

Mr. Brown, 18, who was black, was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, on Aug. 9, 2014. The shooting prompted months of sometimes violent unrest and helped ignite the Black Lives Matter movement.

Mr. Moss said in a telephone interview that he looked forward to working with all segments of the Ferguson community and that the “Police Department should be much more reflective of the community it serves.” “I certainly plan to hire more people of color, more women. I’d like to hire people from Ferguson who are actually committed to what happens there.”
