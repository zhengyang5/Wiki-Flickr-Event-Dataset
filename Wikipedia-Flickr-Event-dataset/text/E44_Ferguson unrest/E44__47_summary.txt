A large coalition of media and press freedom groups have written to police forces in Ferguson, Missouri to protest the harassment of journalists covering the protests there.
Reporters have been arrested, assaulted, teargassed, and threatened repeatedly in the days following the shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson.
"As organizations that cover news and defend the rights of journalists to gather the news, we write to express our deep concern over the unwarranted detention of two journalists on Wednesday and with other reports of police intimidation and harassment of journalists in Ferguson," they wrote.
The letter focused particularly on journalists who were harassed or threatened merely for covering what was happening on the ground in Ferguson.
"Officers on the ground must understand that gathering news and recording police activities are not crimes," the organizations wrote.
