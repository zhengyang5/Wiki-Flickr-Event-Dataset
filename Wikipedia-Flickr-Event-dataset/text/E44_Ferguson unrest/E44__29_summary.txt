Police responding to reports of armed men and gunfire shot a man in Ferguson who they said had pointed a handgun at an officer early this morning.
He said an officer shot him when he attempted to flee.
"Don't be a traitor to Michael Brown in the name of 'you mad,'" he said.
Following Brown's death in Ferguson, social media sites were abuzz with tributes to black men killed by police.
LaQuanda Brown, 28, has spent her entire life in Ferguson, and lives in the same housing complex where Michael Brown — unrelated — lived.
