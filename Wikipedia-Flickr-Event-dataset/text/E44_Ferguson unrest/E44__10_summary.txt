Mr. Brown’s family issued a statement expressing sadness, but calling for peaceful protest and a campaign to require body cameras on police officers nationwide.
He described an altercation inside Officer Wilson’s vehicle, after which Officer Wilson had Mr. Brown’s blood on his weapon, shirt and pants, the prosecutor said, as well as swelling and redness on his face.
Mr. McCulloch also pointed to inconsistent and changing statements from witnesses, including observations about the position of Mr. Brown’s hands.
In a private ceremony in October, he married his fiancée, Barbara Spradling, also a Ferguson police officer, court records show.
Another investigation, a federal civil rights inquiry into the case, continues, though federal officials have said that the evidence so far does not support such a case against Officer Wilson.
