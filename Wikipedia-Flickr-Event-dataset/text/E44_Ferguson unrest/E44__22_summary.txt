The tensions erupted after a candlelight vigil Sunday night for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times the previous afternoon after a scuffle involving the officer, Brown and another person in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of the city.
Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.
People also took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store.
