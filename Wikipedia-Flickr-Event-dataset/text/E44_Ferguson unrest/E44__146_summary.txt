She said 128 people have registered to vote in Ferguson since Michael Brown died Aug. 9.
The result: 4,839 people in St. Louis County have registered to vote since the shooting; 3,287 of them live in Ferguson.
"It's a great move when people come out and register in mass like that," said Anthony Bell, St. Louis 3rd Ward committeeman.
During local elections in April, just 1,484 of the 12,096 registered voters in Ferguson cast ballots.
