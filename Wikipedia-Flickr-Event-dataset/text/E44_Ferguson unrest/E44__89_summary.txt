Oct 20 (Reuters) - A Missouri state senator was arrested on Monday night outside the police department of the embroiled city of Ferguson, authorities said, in another night of protests following the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black teenager in August.
State Senator Jamilah Nasheed was taken into custody by Ferguson police officers, said St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman.
KDSK reported that Nasheed was arrested after standing in the street and blocking traffic, then failing to move despite repeated warnings from police.
Demonstrations have gripped the St. Louis area almost daily since the Aug. 9 killing of unarmed black teenager, 18-year-old Michael Brown, by white police officer Darren Wilson.
Protesters want Wilson arrested immediately and have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor.
