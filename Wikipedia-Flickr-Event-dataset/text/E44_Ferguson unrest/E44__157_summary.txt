It happened fictionally in Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing, when an Asian-American business owner was forced to defend his store from rioters.
“Their rights may have been placed on a lower priority for the people in charge of protecting them.”Local Asian-American business owners, however, say they don’t think looters targeted them because of their race.
Even as the protests continue, many of the owners are already back in their stores, rebuilding and serving Ferguson residents.
“We support this community and this community supports us,” said Priyanka Patel, daughter of the Ferguson Market owners.
Among Asian-American business owners in Ferguson, and other business owners in the St. Louis suburb, there is a deep concern over whether insurance will cover the damages from the looting.
