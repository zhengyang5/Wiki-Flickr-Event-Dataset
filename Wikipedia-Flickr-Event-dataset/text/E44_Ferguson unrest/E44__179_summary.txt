The recording devices were first used at a Saturday march protesting the death of Michael Brown, and training for the entire police force is nearly complete, officials told NBC affiliate KSDK.
Two private security firms donated the cameras amid an uproar over police tactics in the St. Louis suburb.
Despite some privacy concerns, the gadgets have won the support of law-enforcement officials and civil libertarians.
"Documentation, accountability, transparency is part of what we do now, and it should be," Chief Mark Metdker told NBC News.
