The hiring of the officer, Maj. Delrish Moss, 51, was announced Thursday.
It put a black man in charge of a mostly white department that serves a town where African-Americans make up two-thirds of the residents.
Mr. Brown, 18, who was black, was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, on Aug. 9, 2014.
The shooting prompted months of sometimes violent unrest and helped ignite the Black Lives Matter movement.
I’d like to hire people from Ferguson who are actually committed to what happens there.”
