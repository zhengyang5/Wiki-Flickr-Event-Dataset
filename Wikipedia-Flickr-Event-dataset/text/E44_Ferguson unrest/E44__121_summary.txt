(Reuters) - St. Louis County Police released a video on Tuesday they said showed a suspect, charged with shooting at police in the strife-torn city of Ferguson, drawing a pistol from the waistband of his pants.
Prosecutors have charged Tyrone Harris, an 18-year-old black man, with four counts of assault on law enforcement, five counts of armed criminal action, and one count of shooting at a vehicle over the incident that took place on Sunday during evening protests.
