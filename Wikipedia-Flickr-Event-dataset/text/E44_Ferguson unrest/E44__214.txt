“The Secretary-General calls on the authorities to ensure that the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are protected,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters.

“He calls on all to exercise restraint, for law enforcement officials to abide by U.S. and international standards in dealing with demonstrators,” Dujarric said.
