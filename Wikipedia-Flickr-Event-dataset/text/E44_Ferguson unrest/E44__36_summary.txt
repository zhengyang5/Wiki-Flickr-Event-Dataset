Following a fourth night of racially charged demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri, during which police fired tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse crowds of protesters, President Obama urged Americans to unite under the United States’ common values.
“Now’s the time for healing, now’s the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,” Obama said Thursday afternoon during a televised appearance in Martha's Vineyard.
Protesters have gathered every night since Saturday when 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by police in the mostly black suburb of St. Louis.
Police “should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs,” Obama said.
Jay Nixon also spoke Thursday afternoon, stressing the importance of safety as protesters expressed their anger and frustration.
