Mr Brown's mother said the officer had been "disrespectful" in his comments and that she did not believe his account of events.
Mr Brown's supporters said he was attempting to surrender to Mr Wilson when he was shot.
The decision means Mr Wilson will not face state criminal charges over the shooting.
However, the US Justice Department has also launched a federal investigation into whether Mr Wilson violated Mr Brown's civil rights.
