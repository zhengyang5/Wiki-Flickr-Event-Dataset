-- Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal confronted Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson during a press conference Wednesday, asking why she was tear-gassed during a nonviolent protest.
Chappelle-Nadal, a Democrat, said she had been tear-gassed while peacefully protesting the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed African-American teenager shot to death by a police officer on Saturday.
I Just wanted to know if I'm going to be gassed again?"
She continued: â€œI'm the senator for the area, and I felt threatened.
I don't tell people when I'm out with these kids, 'Hey, I'm your senator.'
