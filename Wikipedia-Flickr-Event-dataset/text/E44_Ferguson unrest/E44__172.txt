The Federal Aviation Administration is diverting some St. Louis-bound flights to other airports because of reports of gunshots fired into the sky in Ferguson following a grand jury's decision not to indict the white police officer who fatally shot a black 18-year-old.

The FAA says about 10 flights had been rerouted from Lambert-St. Louis International Airport as of 11:30 p.m. CST Monday. The reason cited was "to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities."

The airport posted on Twitter that only inbound planes, not departures, are affected. The facility remains open.

For two weeks after the August shooting, the FAA restricted flights on 37 square miles of airspace, including for news helicopters. The FAA says media aircraft currently are flying just above the flight restriction zone over Ferguson.
