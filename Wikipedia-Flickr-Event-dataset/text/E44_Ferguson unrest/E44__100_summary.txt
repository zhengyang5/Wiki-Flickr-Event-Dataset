FERGUSON, Mo.
-- The body of a man discovered dead in a car Tuesday in Ferguson, Missouri was burned and shot in the head, according to St. Louis County police.
Joshua's body was found Tuesday morning at the wheel of a 2004 Pontiac parked near the apartment complex where Brown was killed.
Officials say it appears an accelerant was used in an attempt to light Joshua's body on fire.
His body had apparently been in the car for several hours before it was discovered, police said.
