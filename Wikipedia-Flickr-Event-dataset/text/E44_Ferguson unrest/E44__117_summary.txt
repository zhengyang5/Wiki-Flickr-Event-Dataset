The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Tyrone Harris Jr. of St. Louis, remains in critical condition, according to St. Louis County police.
On Monday afternoon, prosecutors issued 10 charges against Harris â€” including four counts of first-degree assault on a police officer.
The unrest prompted officials to place St. Louis County in an immediate state of emergency.
The order puts St. Louis County police Chief John Belmar in command over all police emergency management in Ferguson and surrounding areas.
The chief estimated that 40 to 50 shots were exchanged between rival groups before Harris turned on police.
