Turkish officials have rained down criticism on the US police for detaining a correspondent of the state Anadolu news agency while he covered protests in Ferguson, Missouri, calling it unacceptable and against the freedom of press.
Anadolu reported on Tuesday that its reporter Bilgin Şaşmaz was threatened by a police officer, beaten and detained for five hours while covering the Ferguson protests.
The agency said on Wednesday that a police officer had threatened to kill Şaşmaz and was suspended.
In messages on his Twitter account, Deputy Prime Minister Emrullah İşler said the detention of Şaşmaz was unacceptable.
Another deputy prime minister, Bülent Arınç, said in remarks to Anadolu that the threat against the reporter and his subsequent detention were unacceptable.
