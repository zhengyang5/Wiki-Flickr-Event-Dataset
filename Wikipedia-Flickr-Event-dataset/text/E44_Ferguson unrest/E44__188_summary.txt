ET): @theanonmessage, A Twitter account affiliated with Operation Ferguson has released the name of a police officer who it claims shot Michael Brown.
“There was no debate—everyone on the team embraced the idea.”It has been a busy few days for Operation Ferguson.
Other Anonymous ops have uncovered criminal evidence or the names of suspects.
On Tuesday afternoon, one Anonymous Twitter account threatened to release information about the police chief’s daughter unless he disclosed the name of the officer who’d killed Brown.
“We are not exactly known for being ‘responsible,’ nor for worrying overly much about the safety of cops,” Fawkes told me.
