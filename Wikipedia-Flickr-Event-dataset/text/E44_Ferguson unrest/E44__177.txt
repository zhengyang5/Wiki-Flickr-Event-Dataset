Schools cancel classes after police shooting Posted: Monday, August 11, 2014 3:19 PM EDT Updated: Monday, August 11, 2014 3:20 PM EDT

JENNINGS, Mo. (AP) - A school district located near the St. Louis County community where police shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old black man has canceled its first day of classes out of concern for students' safety.

The Jennings school system told parents Monday that it will wait until Tuesday to open its doors for the new school year after the Saturday shooting in Ferguson of Michael Brown.

The Jennings district borders parts of Ferguson where a Sunday night candlelight vigil turned violent, with widespread looting, dozens of arrests and several attacks on journalists.

Classes in the combined Ferguson-Florissant School District are scheduled to begin on Thursday.
