Vonderrit Myers, an 18-year-old black man shot by an off-duty St. Louis police officer last week, had gunshot residue on his hands and clothing, a Missouri State Highway Patrol report released Tuesday said.
The report said gunshot residue was found on the chest and sleeves of Myers' shirt and “on the inner entrances to the front and back pockets” of his jeans.
“The presence of gunshot residue on a person’s hands could mean the individual discharged a firearm, was near a firearm when it was discharged or touched an object with gunshot residue on it.
“The presence of gunshot residue on the jeans and shirt could be from being in the environment of a discharged weapon or coming in contact with an object with gunshot residue on it,” the statement said.
“Whereas gunshot residue is unlikely to persist on an active person’s hands for more than eight hours, it is not known how long gunshot residue may persist on clothing.
