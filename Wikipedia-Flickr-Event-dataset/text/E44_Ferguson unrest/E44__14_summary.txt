WASHINGTON â€” Ferguson, Mo., is a third white, but the crime statistics compiled in the city over the past two years seemed to suggest that only black people were breaking the law.
They accounted for 85 percent of traffic stops, 90 percent of tickets and 93 percent of arrests.
In cases like jaywalking, which often hinge on police discretion, blacks accounted for 95 percent of all arrests.
It describes a city where the police used force almost exclusively on blacks and regularly stopped people without probable cause.
Racial bias is so ingrained, the report said, that Ferguson officials circulated racist jokes on their government email accounts.
