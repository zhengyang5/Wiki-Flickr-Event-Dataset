Update, 5:25 p.m.: The officer seen in the video has been “suspended indefinitely,’’ according to a statement from the St. Louis County Police Department.

“On Tuesday, August 19, 2014, shortly before midnight, an incident occurred wherein a St. Ann Police Officer pointed a semi-automatic assault rifle at a peaceful protestor after a verbal exchange,’’ the statement reads. “It was at this time a St. Louis County Police Sergeant walked over and immediately took action, forcing the officer to lower the weapon, and escorting him away from the area.

“The unified command strongly feel these actions are inappropriate, and not indicative of the officers who have worked daily, to keep the peace. The St. Ann Police Officer involved in the incident has been relieved of duty and suspended indefinitely.’’

The statement does not name the officer.

Original story: The high tensions between protesters and police in Ferguson, Missouri were captured on video Tuesday night when an officer was recorded pointing his weapon at protesters and yelling obscenities.

As the officer approaches the protesters, he says “I will f—ing kill you, get back!’’

After some crosstalk between protesters, a man asks the officer: “What’s your name, sir?’’

The officer’s response? “Go f— yourself.’’

On Saturday, Aug. 9, a white police officer fatally shot unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black, in the St. Louis suburb. Brown’s funeral is scheduled for Monday morning at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church.

Despite the hostile environment evident from the video, the protests were reportedly “more subdued’’ Tuesday night, with no tear gas employed and no reports of gunfire.
