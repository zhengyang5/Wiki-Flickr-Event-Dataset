â€” A man accused of shooting two St. Louis-area police officers in March during a protest in Ferguson, Mo., pleaded not guilty Wednesday to seven charges.
Prosecutors accuse Williams of shooting and injuring a St. Louis County officer and an officer from suburban Webster Groves on March 12 during an early morning rally after the Ferguson police chief, Tom Jackson, resigned.
Ferguson has been the site of frequent protests since Aug. 9 when white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed.
The St. Louis County officer was shot in the shoulder and is back on duty though he isn't expected to resume full duties until August.
