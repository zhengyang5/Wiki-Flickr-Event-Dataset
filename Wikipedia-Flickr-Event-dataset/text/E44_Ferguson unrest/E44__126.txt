A US policeman has been stood down for threatening to kill a peaceful protester in Ferguson, the suburb in St Louis, Missouri, that has been rocked by unrest since an unarmed black teenager was shot dead by a white police officer this month.

Lieutenant Ray Albers was caught on film pointing an automatic rifle at a protester in a dark street on Tuesday night, shouting "I will f---ing kill you. Get back, get back."

When another protester asked his name, Lieutenant Albers shouted: "Go f--- yourself."
