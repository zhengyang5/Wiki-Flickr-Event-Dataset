More than two hours before a second midnight curfew was set to begin on Sunday night, police fired tear gas and flash grenades in an attempt to disperse the crowd.
The crowd was ordered to disperse, and when they failed to do so, police in riot gear fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and flash grenades.
Tear gas, armored vehicles, flares.
Others claimed that people headed to the McDonald’s to take refuge from the tear gas, and one woman was photographed being treated with milk from the restaurant.
