The incident occurred late Tuesday night amid civil unrest over the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.
At roughly 11:55 PM CDT, a Ferguson police officer was spotted randomly pointing an assault rifle at protesters.
This event was captured by the citizen journalist Rebelutionary_Z.
When asked for his name by Rebelutionary_Z, the officer responded “Go fuck yourself.”The officer pointed his rifle at Rebelutionary_Z’s companion, identified as Josiah (an African-American), and said “I will fucking kill you, get back.”When asked for his name by Rebelutionary_Z, the officer responded “Go fuck yourself.”The full video is here: http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/51598475The clip begins at around the 20 minute mark.
