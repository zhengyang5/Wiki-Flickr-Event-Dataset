Amnesty International is calling for an investigation of the police tactics used by police in Ferguson, Missouri, where local law enforcement have clashed with protesters following the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.
â€œOur delegation traveled to Missouri to let the authorities in Ferguson know that the world is watching.
In a Time op-ed last week, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) condemned Ferguson police's recent conduct, blaming "unprecedented expansion of government power" for the use of military-like tactics by law enforcement.
On Thursday, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) announced his plan to introduce legislation aimed at scaling back the militarization of police.
This bill will end the free transfers of certain aggressive military equipment to local law enforcement and ensure that all equipment can be accounted for."
