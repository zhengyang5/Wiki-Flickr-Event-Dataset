One case in point is this tweet from libertarian-leaning Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), posted last night as reports of police arresting members of the media began to circulate:Images & reports out of #Ferguson are frightening.
Is this a war zone or a US city?
It used the exact same rhetorical formulation as Amash’s, but this time took the form of a statement instead of an answer:This is America, not a war zone.
