North Korea, which is regularly condemned by Washington and others over allegations of gross human rights abuses, said the US had no right to pass judgement on others.
"It should not seek solutions to its problems in suppressing demonstrators, but bring to light the real picture of the American society, a graveyard of human rights, and have a correct understanding of what genuine human rights are like and how they should be guaranteed," the spokesman said.
Impoverished but nuclear-armed North Korea has been ruled for more than six decades by the Kim dynasty, which has zero tolerance for political dissent.
"The US had better... mind its own business, instead of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries", the spokesman said.
China's state media said that "even in a country that has for years tried to play the role of an international human rights judge and defender, there is still much room for improvement".
