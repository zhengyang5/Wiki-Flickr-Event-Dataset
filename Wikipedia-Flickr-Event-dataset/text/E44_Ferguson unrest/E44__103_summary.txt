TORONTO -- Thousands braved freezing temperatures in Toronto on Tuesday night to hold a vigil for Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager slain by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in August.
Protest leader Lena Peters said the immediate issue was that the grand jury made the decision not to take the "murder" of a black man to trial.
"We believe that it is part of a larger system that doesn't value black life."
Peters and others also used the occasion to vent their anger against police in the Greater Toronto Area for alleged racial profiling and brutality against black people.
The protest in Toronto was organized through social media by an online forum called Black Lives Matter.
