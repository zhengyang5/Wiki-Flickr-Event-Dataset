A group of exiled Tibetan monks have joined the protesters at Ferguson, Missouri, where a curfew has entered its second day, after an unarmed black teenager was shot to death by the police last week.
However, now with the Tibetans joining in to support the Ferguson protesters, it is time that the White House realised that the situation has turned into a major human rights violation.
Recently, Twitter users from Gaza also compared the situation in Ferguson to the unrest in their country.
Tibet, a country that has been occupied by China for decades, is facing one of the world's longest-standing human rights crisis.
And despite the human rights violations, the Tibetans have been protesting with non-violent means against the Chinese government.
