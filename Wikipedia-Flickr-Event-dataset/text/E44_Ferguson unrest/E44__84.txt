Around 12:14, the cameraman, Mustafa Hussein of Argus Radio, tells a woman that he is a former Marine, but she doesn't believe that he's a veteran.

The footage doesn't get better — At 16:43, a Cardinals fan screams "Africa! Africa! Africa!" and others chant "USA!" to drown out the Michael Brown demonstrators. Less than a minute later, another Cardinals supporter chants "remove your hat" and an older white man tells Ferguson protesters to "pull up your pants." The Ferguson protesters counter with chants of: "This is what democracy looks like."
