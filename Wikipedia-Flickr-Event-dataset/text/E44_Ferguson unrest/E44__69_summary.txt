Earlier Wednesday Attorney General Eric Holder met with the parents of Brown, a black unarmed 18-year-old who was shot dead by a white police officer on August 9.
Brown's remains are undergoing three separate autopsies -- by local authorities, the family and Holder's Justice Department.
This is something that has a history to it and the history simmers beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson."
As Holder met with locals, police said that one of its officers was suspended after pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle late Tuesday at a peaceful protester following a "verbal exchange."
"We want due process," said Heather Arcovitch, the senior pastor at the First Congregational Church of St. Louis, speaking to the crowd through a bullhorn.
