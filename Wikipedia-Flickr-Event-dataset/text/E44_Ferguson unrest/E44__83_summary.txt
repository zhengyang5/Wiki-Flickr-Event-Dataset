(Robert Samuels/The Washington Post)Ferguson, Mo., police chief Thomas Jackson ceded responsibility for managing protests in the city to the larger St. Louis County police department on Friday.
A “lack of resources and manpower were the main driving force in Chief Jackson’s request,” according to a county press release.
Brian Schellman, spokesman for county police, added that Jackson made the request via a phone call to County Police Chief Jon Belmar.
With 460 members, the county police department is nearly 10 times the size of the police department in this suburb of 21,000.
Meanwhile, community leaders in Ferguson have consistently criticized the handling of nightly protests as being arbitrary and unnecessarily aggressive.
