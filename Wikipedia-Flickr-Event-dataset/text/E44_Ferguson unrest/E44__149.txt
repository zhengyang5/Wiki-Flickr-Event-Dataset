Associated Press - FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) - A Ferguson convenience store that was looted and burned after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown will be rebuilt as a job training center.

The Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis said Friday that the center is part of its "empowering communities" effort.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the center will house the new Save Our Sons program. St. Louis area companies have contributed $1.2 million toward the effort, meant to give young jobless or underemployed men a month's training before matching them with area jobs.

The center will be located on the site of a former QuikTrip that rioters set fire to Aug. 10, a day after ex-Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot and killed Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old.

More details will be announced Monday.
