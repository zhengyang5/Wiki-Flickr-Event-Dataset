The Guardian reports about 150 people gathered as a show of solidarity with Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown during an encounter on Aug. 9:"He was doing his job," said Kaycee Reinisch, 57, of Lincoln County, Missouri.
Those at the rally held signs and signed posters in support of Wilson, reports KSDK Channel 5 in St. Louis.
Some supporting Wilson were selling T-shirts for $7 each with a police badge on the front and the saying "Officer Darren Wilson, I stand by you", according to the Telegraph.
KSDK reported the rally was organized by the Support Darren Wilson Facebook page, which has more than 19,000 likes.
News published a photo of Wilson receiving a commendation six months ago for "extraordinary effort in the line of duty".
