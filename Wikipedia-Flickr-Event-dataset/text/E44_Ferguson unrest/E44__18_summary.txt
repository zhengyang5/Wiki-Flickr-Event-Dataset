Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer, has patrolled suburban St. Louis for six years and had no previous complaints filed against him, Jackson said.
Brown's relatives said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up.
Family attorneys said Brown's parents were blindsided by the allegations and the release of a surveillance video from the store.
The police chief described Wilson as "a gentle, quiet man" who had been "an excellent officer."
According to police reports released Friday, authorities received a 911 call at 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market.
