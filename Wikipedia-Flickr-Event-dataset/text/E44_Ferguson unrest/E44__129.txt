If a 20-year veteran police lieutenant acts like this, we are all in trouble…

(FERGUSON) Those of us watching a Livestream feed from protestors Wednesday night saw the most disturbing video clip, of a rogue police officer with an assault weapon thrashing around and threatening to kill peaceful, non violent demonstrators.

The officer pointed his rifle at Rebelutionary_Z’s companion, identified as Josiah (an African-American), and said “I will f*cking kill you, get back.”

20-year police veteran Lt. Ray Albers, 46, was caught on film by livestreamers yelling at protesters and journalists, “I will fucking kill you, get back, get back,” with his rifle aimed on them, urging the crowd to disperse from the area. The incident occurred late Tuesday night amid civil unrest over the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

At roughly 11:55 PM CDT, a Ferguson police officer was spotted randomly pointing an assault rifle at protesters. This event was captured by the citizen journalist Rebelutionary_Z.

When asked for his name by Rebelutionary_Z, the officer responded “Go fuck yourself.”

The clip begins at around the 20 minute mark. The video quality is better on the original; my apologies. I don’t really know what I’m doing.
