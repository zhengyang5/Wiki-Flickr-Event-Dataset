The FAA says about 10 flights had been rerouted from Lambert-St. Louis International Airport as of 11:30 p.m. CST Monday.
The reason cited was "to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities."
The airport posted on Twitter that only inbound planes, not departures, are affected.
For two weeks after the August shooting, the FAA restricted flights on 37 square miles of airspace, including for news helicopters.
The FAA says media aircraft currently are flying just above the flight restriction zone over Ferguson.
