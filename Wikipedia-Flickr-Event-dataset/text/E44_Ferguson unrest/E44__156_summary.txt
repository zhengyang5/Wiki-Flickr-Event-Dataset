(at the 00:15 mark):What's in dispute about the first weekend's protests— Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told reporters that Saturday's protest at the crime scene "probably bordered on riot conditions."
It's become the unofficial motto of the Ferguson protests.
Police told protesters to "go home," but several residents protested that they were trapped in cul-de-sacs while the main road was closed off.
— Nixon noted that the FBI's civil rights investigation into the Michael Brown shooting is "being beefed up" with investigators now on the ground in Ferguson.
— Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, has been put on paid administrative leave while the investigation is conducted.
