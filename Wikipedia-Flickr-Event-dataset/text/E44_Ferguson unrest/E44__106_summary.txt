Denis and Rasim are younger brothers to the late Zemir Begic, 32, who was beat to death Sunday in St. Louis.
"Justice for Zemir is all I want," said youngest brother Rasim, 20, a pre-med student at the University of South Dakota.
Begic's father, with two of his own brothers, trekked to St. Louis to retrieve his son's body.
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay this week issued a statement to try to calm his city's Bosnian community.
