In the streets of Ferguson, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media.
Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street.
The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.
Suhr reported from St. Louis.
