The Federal Aviation Administration issued a no-fly zone over Ferguson, Missouri, Tuesday at the request of the St. Louis County Police Department.
The St. Louis County Police Department told TIME it asked the FAA for the flight restriction after a police helicopter was fired upon “multiple times” during civil unrest Sunday.
The FAA order restricts flights over the Ferguson area below 3,000 feet to first responders only, including medical and police helicopters.
The Ferguson restriction, however, may make it more difficult for news media to get aerial footage of the town as the Brown story continues to develop.
“If we feel that order is restored we can request ran early termination,” St. Louis County police spokesperson Bryan Schellman told TIME.
