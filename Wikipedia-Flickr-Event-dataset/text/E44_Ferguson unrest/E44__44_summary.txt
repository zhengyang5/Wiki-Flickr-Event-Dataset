The full statement:This morning, I met with President Obama to discuss the events in Ferguson, Missouri.
Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died.
By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them.
Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.
All the while, the federal civil rights investigation into the shooting incident itself continues, in parallel with the local investigation into state law violations.
