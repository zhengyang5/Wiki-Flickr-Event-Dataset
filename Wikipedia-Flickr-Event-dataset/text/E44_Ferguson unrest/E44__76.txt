A memorial to Michael Brown, the unarmed black teen shot to death by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, burned to the ground Tuesday morning, a fire official said. The Ferguson Fire Department was called at 6:45 a.m. CT to Canfield Drive in the St. Louis suburb, a spot close to where Brown was killed on Aug. 9, Capt. Jeremy Corcoran said. Firefighters used portable water extinguishers to put out the fire in a small area where people had placed mementos in memory of the 18-year-old, who was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, Corcoran said.

It was not immediately clear what the cause of the fire was, but Corcoran said there was evidence that candles had been part of the memorial.
