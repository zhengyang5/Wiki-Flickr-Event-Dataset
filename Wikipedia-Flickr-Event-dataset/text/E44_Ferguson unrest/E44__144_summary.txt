Darren Seals, a well known leader of the Ferguson protests, was found shot and killed inside of a burning car early Tuesday morning in Missouri.
“We have lost a great champion of civil rights in our community,” said Bassem Masri, a friend who had live-streamed the Ferguson protests, sometimes with Seals walking behind him to protect him as he filmed.
Some activists were understandably frustrated with the way Darren Seals went about his protest but he was truly dedicated to improving his community.
His friends still hope to raise enough money to open the Darren Seals Youth Community Center in his honor.
Seals' death is eerily similar to the 2014 murder of Deandre Joshua near the street where Michael Brown was gunned down, though police say the two crimes appear unrelated.
