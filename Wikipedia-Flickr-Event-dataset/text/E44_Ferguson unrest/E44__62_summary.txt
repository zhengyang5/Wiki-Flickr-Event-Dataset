There will be no curfew in Ferguson, Mo., on Monday night, Gov.
The National Guard will operate in Ferguson under the command of the highway patrol.
On Thursday, after days of standoffs that were becoming increasingly tense as tear gas and rubber bullets were fired at protesters, Nixon had placed the highway patrol in charge of security in Ferguson.
For the first night after the highway patrol took command, hugs and calm replaced tear gas and fear on the streets of Ferguson.
On Saturday, Nixon announced the curfew.
