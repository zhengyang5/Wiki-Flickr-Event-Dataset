The St. Louis County Police Department said the hacking group Anonymous has identified the wrong shooter of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.
Thursday morning, Anonymous released the name of the man it believes to be the police officer who shot and killed Brown over the weekend.
In a brazen act of protest, vigilantes claiming to be members of Anonymous gave the Ferguson police department an ultimatum: Release the name or we will.
The "Operation Ferguson" group went through with its promise Thursday morning, publishing a man's name, his photograph and his conversation with a friend on Facebook.
County police responded to Anonymous on Twitter, denying that the man works for St. Louis County or Ferguson police.
