However, the St. Louis County Police Department responded that the name the group posted is false.
The department tells the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the name Anonymous released is not a Ferguson or a St. Louis County police officer.
Ferguson, a predominantly black city of roughly 21,000 residents, is about 10 miles northwest of St. Louis.
Witnesses say Brown had his hands raised when the officer repeatedly shot him.
Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.
