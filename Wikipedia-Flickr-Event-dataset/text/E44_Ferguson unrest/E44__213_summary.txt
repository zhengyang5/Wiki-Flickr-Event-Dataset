(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg)You can understand if President Obama would rather talk about the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq, where he has scored some victories, than talk about the unholy mess in Ferguson, Mo.
Surprisingly, though, ISIS militants are following developments in the St. Louis suburb, and some of them would rather focus on that.
The Islamic State and other jihadist movements are using the events outside St. Louis as propaganda against the West.
“What has happened in Ferguson today, can also happen anytime in France, Germany or Britain,” said Abu Sameer.
“The anti-Muslim sentiments are there and became normality and we tell the youth, communism has failed, the Islamic State is your only solution.”
