The tension in a St. Louis suburb following the shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager by a police officer was thrown into stark relief Sunday night in a video captured by CNN of a police officer yelling a derogatory phrase at protesters.
On Saturday, Michael Brown, 18, was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis.
The Ferguson Police Department has asserted that Brown assaulted the officer, whose name has not yet been released.
"Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess," Ferguson Mayor James Knowles (R) told KTVI-TV in St. Louis.
"Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.
