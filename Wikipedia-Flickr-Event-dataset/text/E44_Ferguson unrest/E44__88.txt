FERGUSON, Mo. â€” Missouri state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed was arrested Monday night on the streets of Ferguson.

Video provided to KSDK-TV by CNN showed Nasheed, a Democrat who represents parts of St. Louis, being handcuffed in the middle of the street outside the Ferguson Police Department.

Nasheed yelled, "No justice," and her fellow protesters shouted back, "No peace," as police led her and an unidentified man into the police station.

Police did not indicate what charges they'll file against Nasheed, but said she was standing in the middle of the road blocking traffic, and would not move after repeated warnings by authorities.

Since Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed teen Michael Brown of Ferguson on Aug. 9, thousands of protesters have called for Wilson's arrest.

Police say Brown struggled with Wilson inside his police car and reached for the officer's weapon. Brown's family says the teen was killed as he raised his hands to surrender to the officer.

A grand jury is hearing the case and will decide whether to charge Wilson with Brown's death.
