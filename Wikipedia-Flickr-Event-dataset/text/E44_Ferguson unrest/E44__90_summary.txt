Nixon had previously said he was ready to order national guard troops back into the St Louis suburb whenever necessary.
In August, the national guard protected a makeshift police base at a shopping mall during nights of clashes between officers and protesters following Brownâ€™s death in a residential side-street.
National guard troops in Ferguson would again be commanded by brigadier general Gregory Mason, a veteran of the Missouri state highway patrol, which will police potential unrest alongside the St Louis metropolitan police and St Louis county police.
The officer shot Brown repeatedly after an altercation that followed Wilson stopping him and a friend for jaywalking.
A series of actions is planned in response around the St Louis region and the US.
