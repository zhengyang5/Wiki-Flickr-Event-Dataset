West noted on his website, "Instead of being thankful for getting off the unemployment line for a few weeks and having a little fun protesting, the paid rioters who tore up Ferguson, MO, are protesting again.
"First of all, can you even imagine getting paid $5,000.00 a month for running around holding a sign and burning down an occasional building?
The protesters say they are unable to pay their bills after taking time to travel to Ferguson.
"There's absolutely no doubt that part of the reason that Ferguson flared up was because protesters were being paid to be there.
How many more will be paid in the future?"
