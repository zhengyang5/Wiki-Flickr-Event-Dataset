A Scotland Decides programme presented by Huw Edwards will be broadcast on BBC One from 22:35 BST, while Scotland Decides The Result will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland.
In a national referendum, there is only one result - the total number of votes cast in favour of "Yes/No" to the referendum question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"
But bad weather could delay the receipt of ballot boxes at a count, and as a consequence, delay the overall national result.
More than 4.2 million people have registered to vote in the independence referendum, making it the largest electorate ever in Scotland.
