Mr Salmond yesterday faced a series of calls to allow “proper scrutiny” of his government’s legal advice, which he insisted would allow the Scottish Parliament to stage the referendum lawfully.
However, Mr Salmond’s reluctance to publish his own government’s legal advice on the referendum was described as fuelling “suspicion” by Labour’s shadow Scottish secretary.
Margaret Curran said: “The legal competence of proceeding with a referendum is highly significant and reflects what a number of experts have said, so if the SNP holds differing legal advice, they should publish it today.
Tory MSP Murdo Fraser claimed Mr Salmond’s refusal to publish his legal advice was creating “uncertainty”.
A spokesman for the UK government, which has also not yet published its legal advice, declined to comment on the row.
