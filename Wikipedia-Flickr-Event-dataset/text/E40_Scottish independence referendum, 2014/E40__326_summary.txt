Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling have reflected on their head-to-head TV clash, ahead of the Scottish independence referendum.
Mr Darling, leader of the campaign for a "No" vote in the 18 September referendum, said Mr Salmond failed to answer key questions.
Speaking the day after the clash, Mr Salmond hit out at the former UK chancellor's debating style.
More than 56% thought Mr Darling came out on top while 44% thought Mr Salmond won.
However, Mr Jenkins insisted another ICM question showed Mr Salmond made greater strides at convincing undecided voters to back independence.
