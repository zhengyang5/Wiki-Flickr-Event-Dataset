From: greencomms@scottish.parliament.uk GREEN MSP MEDIA RELEASE For immediate release 25 January 2012 REFERENDUM SHOULD SPARK AN ERA OF RADICAL SCOTTISH DEMOCRACY The Scottish Green Party today welcomed the publication of the independence referendum consultation, and called for the coming months of civic debate to act as testbed for a more inclusive way of doing politics in Scotland. Greens have welcomed the role of the Electoral Commission, and repeated their call for the UK Government to give ground and withdraw their opposition to allowing 16 and 17 year olds to vote in the referendum. Patrick Harvie MSP has today asked the First Minister to confirm that any negotiations regarding the transition to an independent Scotland would leave no room for a deal on Trident remaining in Scotland. Patrick Harvie MSP said: “I welcome this consultation and the opportunity for a genuine discussion on how, over the coming years, we can engage in an effective and fair way with all Scots on the future of our constitution and our democracy. Greens have a vision of a more radical democracy in Scotland, with far greater levels of discussion and decision making at community level. Our hope is that the debate over independence will spark a new enthusiasm for people taking control over the future of our country and our communities. “The draft bill published today gives the Scottish Parliament a real chance to prove its ability to work constructively and design a referendum that is fair and decisive. I welcome the move to accept the oversight of the Electoral Commission by the Scottish Government. Now it’s time for Westminster to give ground and allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote. Young adults of this age can be sent to war – how can it possibly be just to deny them a vote on what type of country theirs is in the world? “The First Minister is right to say that an independent Scotland could rid itself of the presence of nuclear weapons. But we need to go further: no Scottish Government, either before the referendum or after it, should be able to do a deal with the UK to retain Trident on our shores. “There are many people who want to vote Yes, who came to support independence on the nuclear issue alone. We must not betray them by leaving the door open to nuclear weapons in Scotland. That door must be locked forever.” Ben Miller Media and Campaigns Scottish Green MSPs Scottish Parliament Edinburgh EH99 1SP Tel: 0131 348 6360 Mob: 07909 933 074 Fax: 0131 348 5972 Calls welcome via RNID Typetalk 18001 0131 348 6363 _______________________________________________ SGP News mailing list.
