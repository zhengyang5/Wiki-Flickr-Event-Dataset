All the political parties and the Yes and No campaign teams intend to spend hundreds of thousands in the run-up to the referendum on campaigning and advertising.
Those guidelines, drawn up earlier this year, disagreed with the SNP’s own initial spending limits.
The SNP said there should be just £750,000 for the two main campaign teams, and £250,000 for each political party, during the restricted period.
The Scottish Government will take in the view of the Electoral Commission.
The deal will give the Scottish Parliament the power to hold a legally-binding referendum by the end of 2014.
