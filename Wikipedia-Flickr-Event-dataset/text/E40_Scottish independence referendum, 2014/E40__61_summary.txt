And could Scotland afford an improved childcare system?
Childcare policy is devolved to Holyrood.
All three and four-year-olds in Scotland are entitled to 12.5 hours per week of free childcare, increasing to 15 hours in August, and extended to vulnerable two-year-olds.
In the rest of the UK, state-funded childcare is between 10 and 15 hours a week.
