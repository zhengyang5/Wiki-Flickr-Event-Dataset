Tell Scotland you love her.
Where was all this sentiment when parts of Scotland were being thrown on the scrapheap during the 80s and 90s?
Scotland is restless and which ever way the vote goes, this relationship is fundamentally altered.

Indeed, after all this love-bombing, England, if you love Scotland so much, let her go.
