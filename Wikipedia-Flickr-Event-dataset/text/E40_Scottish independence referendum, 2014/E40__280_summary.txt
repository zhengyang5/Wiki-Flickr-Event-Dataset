The SNP is today highlighting the need for a Yes vote as the UK government’s welfare cuts have been condemned by a leading charity following the publication of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s report which reveals nearly 400,000 households in ­Scotland are living on incomes too low to afford an adequate standard of living ­.
These findings show an alarming 18% rise over three years - up 70,000 from 2008/9.
"Only a Yes vote will deliver full control of the welfare system to the Scottish Parliament – a position supported 56% of people in Scotland.
Only then will Scotland have the powers needed to guarantee that our most vulnerable individuals are protected."
