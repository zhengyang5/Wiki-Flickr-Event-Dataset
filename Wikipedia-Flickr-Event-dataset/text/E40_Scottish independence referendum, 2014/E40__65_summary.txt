SCOTS can expect to remain Â­British citizens if they vote for independence, the UK Government has conceded.
The next generation of Scots would also be British, the paper suggests, as children inherit citizenship under present UK rules.
Their children would not be British, as British citizens outside the UK cannot pass on their citizenship more than one generation.
As British citizens, Scots would keep their existing passports and continue to qualify for UK consular help abroad.
Government sources stressed existing citizenship rules could be changed by a future UK Government and there were no guarantees about British citizenship.
