Independence supporters make the point that Scotland’s health service is already effectively independent, and has been since the creation of the service 65 years ago.
Scotland’s achievements in the health service show the benefits of the Scottish Government having responsibility for services in Scotland with improvements in services across the country.
With independence the Scottish Government will have access to all revenues raised in Scotland, ensuring the NHS can be properly protected from Westminster privatisation.
On cross-border treatment, the Yes camp argue that NHS Scotland and NHS England are already separate organisations and there are already contractual arrangements between the two ensuring that if treatment is required across borders there is no disruption to patients.
