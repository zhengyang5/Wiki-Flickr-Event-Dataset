Scotland and England would share the same currency but the current UK fiscal union and banking union would end, leaving us with an arrangement like the one that caused such instability within the euro.
The SNP have had to accept that interest rate decisions depend in part on the tax and spending judgments governments make.
So they now say that there would be some sort of “fiscal pact” between Scotland and the rest of the UK.
This works when a country has a banking and a fiscal union, as the UK does.
Who would decide how a Scottish bank would be bailed out?
