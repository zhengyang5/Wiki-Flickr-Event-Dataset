A bill to give 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote in the Scottish independence referendum was passed by MSPs on the last day of their term.
It gives those born on or before 18 September 1998 the right to vote in the referendum.
Reducing the voting age has been a long standing policy of the SNP, which forms the Scottish government.
Announcing the measure as part of the The Scottish Referendum (Franchise) Bill earlier this year, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said young people had the biggest stake in the future of the country.
The franchise bill will base voter eligibility on Scottish parliamentary and council elections.
