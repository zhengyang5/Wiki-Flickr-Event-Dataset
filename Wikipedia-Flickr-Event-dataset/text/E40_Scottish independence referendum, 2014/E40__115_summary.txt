The directive says that banks must have their head offices "in the same member state as its registered office".
Lloyds already has its head office in London, separate from its Scotland registered office.
And RBS has two head offices, one in London, one in Scotland - and, to repeat (yawn), Scotland is its legal home.
Or to put it another way, Lloyds' and RBS' home in Scotland can be seen as good and bad for both sides in the independence argument.
All that said, it is no great surprise that neither side have been shouting that Scottish independence equals emigration to London of Lloyds and RBS.
