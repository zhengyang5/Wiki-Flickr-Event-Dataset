STV prepare for second referendum debateNicola Sturgeon and Anas Sarwar will face off later this evening in a televised debate on welfare and pensions in an independent Scotland.
The debate is the second referendum debate to take place this year on STV’s flagship current affairs programme, Scotland Tonight, and will begin at 10:30 PM.
The first debate took place in May and saw Nicola Sturgeon debate the economics of independence with Michael Moore.
John MacKay moderated the debate and fielded questions as he will do again tonight, after which the two politicians enjoyed the opportunity to “cross-examine” each other.
However, Joan McAlpine, SNP MSP for South Scotland, criticised the broadcaster for failing to air the debate in the Scottish Borders, which are part of the cross-border “ITV Border” broadcasting region.
