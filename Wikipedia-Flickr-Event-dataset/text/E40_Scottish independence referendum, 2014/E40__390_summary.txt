Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said Better Together agents took "tallies" of postal votes at sample openings held before the count.
Secrecy ruleShe said postal votes were not counted until after the polls closed, but added: "Different local authorities have had openings around the country.
Speaking on the BBC's results coverage, Humza Yousaf, the Scottish minister for external affairs, also made reference to indications from "postal ballot sampling".
"That's initial postal ballot sampling, all the caveats thrown in, etc., etc.."The SNP said Mr Yousaf was referring to sampling of postal votes after the ballot had closed.
The ballot papers were supposed to be kept face down when postal voting packs were opened so postal ballot agents and observers were unable to see how people had voted.
