Published in Oil Industry News on Wednesday, 3 September 2014Scotland could be sitting on more than double the amount of oil and gas reserves currently predicted, a new independent industry investigation has found.
The investigation reveals that the scale of Scotland’s untapped frontier West Coast or Atlantic Margin has been underestimated.
The investigation was undertaken by oilandgaspeople.com , the world’s largest oil and gas industry jobs board, and independent North Sea oil and gas industry experts.
The findings show that the current predictions of extensive untapped reserves of oil and gas could be underestimated by 100%.
The West Coast alone could provide oil and gas for over 100 years with an estimated value of more than £1 trillion.
