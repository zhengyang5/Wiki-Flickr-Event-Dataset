Scottish farmers will be deprived of hundreds of millions of euros in European subsidies that is rightfully theirs following today’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget announcement by the UK Government.
The only reason that the UK qualifies for the uplift is because of Scotland’s low payments under the current system.
However, the UK Government has confirmed that it will not pass on the uplift to Scotland and will instead impose deeper cuts to Scotland’s CAP budget – leaving farmers here with the lowest per hectare payments in Europe.
Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said:“This is a disgraceful budget settlement for Scotland’s farmers and crofters and confirms our worst fears.
It condemns Scottish farmers and crofters to the lowest CAP payments in Europe and completely disregards both the cross party demands in the Scottish Parliament and the wishes of the European Union.
