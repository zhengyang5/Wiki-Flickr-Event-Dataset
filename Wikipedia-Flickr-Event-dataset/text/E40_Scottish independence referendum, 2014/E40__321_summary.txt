Alex Salmond will debate independence with both the leader of the No campaign and the new Secretary of State for Scotland, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon has said.
There is "no question" that Mr Salmond will debate with Better Together chief Alistair Darling and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael between now and the referendum, Ms Sturgeon said.
But Ms Sturgeon reiterated that the First Minister's main target is Prime Minister David Cameron whom Mr Salmond has repeatedly lobbied to take part in a live televised debate.
She said: "I am sure that between now and the referendum Alex Salmond will debate with both of those people and many others, making the positive case for independence.
"The real question is why will David Cameron not agree to debate with Alex Salmond?
