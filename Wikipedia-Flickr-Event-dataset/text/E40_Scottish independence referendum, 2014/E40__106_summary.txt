Scotland should be given full income tax powers following a vote against independence, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said.
She also argued Holyrood should get additional responsibility over VAT, income tax and welfare.
The tax-free personal income tax allowance should remain reserved to Westminster, but, after that, the Scottish Parliament would decide on rates and bands.
However, the prime minister described the commission's report as a "clear, coherent and Conservative blueprint for the next stage of Scotland's devolution journey".
Scotland is due to get some limited powers over income tax in 2016 as a result of the Scotland Act.
