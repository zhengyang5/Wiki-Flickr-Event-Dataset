The Treasury claimed on Monday that research by the London School of Economics had put the cost of setting up an independent Scotland at £2.7bn.
It cited a study carried out by the school's Prof Patrick Dunleavy.
But Prof Dunleavy described the Treasury's claim as "crude misinformation".
In a media briefing, ahead of its analysis paper on the cost of independence, the Treasury used the £2.7bn figure as a "reasonable costing".
