Members of the pro-independence Academics for Yes group attacked what they called "marketised" higher education elsewhere in the UK.
They argued independence was the best way for Scotland to avoid the imposition of tuition fees on students.
Last year senior academics claimed a referendum "Yes" vote threatened scientific research in Scotland.
Scotland does not charge fees to Scottish students, but those from elsewhere in the UK can be charged up to Â£9,000.
Academics for Yes said they were concerned the current arrangement may not last.
