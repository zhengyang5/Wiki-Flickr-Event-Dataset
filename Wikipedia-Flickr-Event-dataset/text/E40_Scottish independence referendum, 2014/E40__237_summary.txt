And it certainly matters in Scotland - the issue of pensions has consistently registered as one of the key issues in the independence debate.
The pension age is currently 65 for men, while women are in the process of being raised to that entitlement age.
Nicola Sturgeon, in her introduction to the Scottish government's pensions paper, said independence offers "a genuine opportunity to deliver an affordable, fair and efficient pensions system".
In November, the NAPF called on both the Scottish and Westminster governments to clarify their plans for pensions if Scotland becomes independent.
In a report called Scottish independence: the implications for pensions, the association concluded that independence would have "substantial implications" for pensions and questioned how the proposed regulatory scheme would work.
