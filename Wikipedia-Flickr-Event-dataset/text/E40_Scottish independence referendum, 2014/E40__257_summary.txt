Scotland secretary says if islands were to vote no but national vote was yes, it could become self-governing like Isle of ManOil-rich Shetland may consider becoming a self-governing territory like the Isle of Man rather than stay part of an independent Scotland in the event of a yes vote, the Scotland secretary, Alistair Carmichael, has said.
Responding to Carmichael's comments, a Yes Scotland spokesman said: "Scotland's island communities will have greater control over their local economies, natural environment and be represented at the heart of government in an independent Scotland.
"A yes vote is about empowering people and communities throughout Scotland, including our island communities.
But Carmichael's comments were echoed by Tavish Scott, Shetland's MSP, who when asked whether Shetland would have to obey the will of Scotland in the event of a yes vote, said: "Will it now?
"I have a business, and I wonder how a yes vote would affect me.
