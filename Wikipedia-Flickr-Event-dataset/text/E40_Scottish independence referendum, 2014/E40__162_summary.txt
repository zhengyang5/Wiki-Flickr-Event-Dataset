"A durable, successful currency union requires some ceding of national sovereignty," declared the Governor of the Bank of England.
Others have warned before now that the Mr Salmond's vision of a currency union that allowed the Scottish Government free rein over its economy was unrealistic.
He believes, as do dissenters within Yes Scotland, that there ought to be a Plan B, and that Plan B should be a separate Scottish currency.
Jim Sillars, Dennis Canavan and the Green Party's Patrick Harvie have all considered the pitfalls of a currency union and concluded that it does not sound much like independence.
They favour a separate currency.
