Leader of campaign against independence mocks SNP leader for claiming 'everything will change but nothing will change'Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor who is leading the campaign against Scottish independence, has taunted Alex Salmond for assuring people "everything will change but nothing will change".
"My argument is why on earth would you want to do that when everybody knows currency union inevitably takes you to closer economic and fiscal union?
Darling, who was preparing to launch the pro-union campaign in Edinburgh, said Salmond no longer talked of the euro because he knew it was "toxic".
Leaving the UK would leave Scotland "heavily dependent and exposed to the fortunes of North Sea oil", said Darling.
A series of 10 leaflets will be produced looking at different areas in which Scotland benefits from being part of the UK.
