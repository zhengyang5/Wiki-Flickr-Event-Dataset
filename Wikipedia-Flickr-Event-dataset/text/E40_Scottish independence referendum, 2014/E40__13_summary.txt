Alex Salmond's planned independence referendum would be contrary to ''the rule of law'' and undermine democracy, the UK Government's top Scottish law officer has claimed.
''The Scottish Parliament has no power to legislate for a referendum on independence,'' he said.
One is that to proceed with a referendum that is outside of its legal powers would be to act contrary to the rule of law.
But Mr Salmond attacked what he called ''London interference'' and signalled his intention to push ahead with his own referendum.
A spokesman for Alex Salmond said the Scottish Government is ''confident'' about its legal right to hold an ''advisory'' referendum.
