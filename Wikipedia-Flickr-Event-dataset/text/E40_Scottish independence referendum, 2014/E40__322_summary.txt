But Mr Darling insisted the distinction was false because the campaign “only exists” thanks to the First Minister and senior appointees will have been approved by him.
However, he saved his most outspoken comments for his opposite number, Mr Jenkins, who infamously refused at the Yes Scotland launch to provide any details about separation because it was focused on winning over “hearts and minds”.
Mr Darling said: “I am pretty clear that on the other side, that there is only one person that really calls the shots and the Yes campaign only exists because Alex Salmond said it would exist.
“I think they will need to rethink that or else at some point the SNP will put someone else up who can,” Mr Darling said.
He was also scathing about the Yes Scotland launch in May, which featured a series of left-wing diatribes about increasing taxes on the wealthy, saying it resembled something produced by a 1970s agitprop theatre group.
