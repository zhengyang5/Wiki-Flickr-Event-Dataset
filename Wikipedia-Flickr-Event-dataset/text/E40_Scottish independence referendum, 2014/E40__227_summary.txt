The question of whether the Queen would remain the head of state in an independent Scotland has been thrown into the spotlight once again after a Scottish minister said it would be "up to the people".
Last month the chairman of the Yes Scotland advisory board, Dennis Canavan declared that the newest member of the Royal Family and third in line to the UK throne should never be king of Scotland.
The First Minister has not said there would be a referendum on the Queen being retained as head of state, yet Ms Campbell has suggested otherwise.
"The Scottish Government and SNP position, which I support, is clear - an independent Scotland will retain the Queen as head of state.
The Queen is already monarch of 16 independent states in the Commonwealth, and a Yes vote next year will mean an independent Scotland will take its place as the seventeenth."
