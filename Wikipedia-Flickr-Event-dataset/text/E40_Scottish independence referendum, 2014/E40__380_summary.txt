“As I have said before, an idea never dies,” Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said Friday in response to the Scottish referendum results.
So strong was the desire of Quebec sovereignists to jump-start the moribund cause here that they took the chance of grabbing onto the Scottish independence referendum as their own personal flotation device.
Rosemont MNA Jean-François Lisée, for example, said a Yes vote would be a "shining example" for the next referendum in Quebec.
What they got instead was a dose of the same Scotch mist that poured down on the dreams of Yes Scotland.
Having been there, Quebec sovereignists feel their pain.
