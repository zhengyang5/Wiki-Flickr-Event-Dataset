Willie Rennie MSP, Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, has revealed that an independent Scotland could lose £210 million each year in research funding from UK based sources.
In 2009/2010 various research projects in Scotland received a total of £234 million through the UK Research Councils.
This money went to funding research in pioneering new technologies, exactly the kind of high-tech jobs that an aspiration Scotland wants to attract.
Scotland received a total of £130 million from UK based charities, £100 million from UK central government and £47 million of funding allocated to UK universities by UK industry, commerce and public corporations.
Mr Salmond cannot guarantee that there would be alternative funding sources to fill the funding gap of £210 million every year.
