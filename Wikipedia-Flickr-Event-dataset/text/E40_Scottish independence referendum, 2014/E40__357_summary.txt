Most voters reckoned it was his opponent, Mr Darling, who won the first leaders' debate three weeks ago.
ICM's instant poll of those who actually watched the programme found that 47% put Mr Darling ahead, while only 37% believed the first minister came off best.
However, today's second debate could still prove to be an invaluable second chance for Mr Salmond.
With just three weeks to go, Mr Salmond badly needs tonight's debate to move the polls in the "Yes" side's direction.
