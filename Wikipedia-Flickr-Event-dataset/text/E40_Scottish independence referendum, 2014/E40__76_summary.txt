In the event of a Yes vote in next year's referendum, Scotland has a variety of options in developing its own defence forces.
The obvious first option would be to create a Scottish Defence Force based on what can be transferred from the departing UK armed forces.
However, prolonged exposure to underinvestment has resulted in the Irish Defence Forces (IDF) becoming exceptionally efficient in maximising the funding available.
For Irish forces to participate in an overseas mission, there has to be a Government decision, parliamentary approval and – crucially – UN approval.
At Army level there should be a Special Forces unit, possibly similar to the Irish Army Ranger Wing, and an air-defence unit.
