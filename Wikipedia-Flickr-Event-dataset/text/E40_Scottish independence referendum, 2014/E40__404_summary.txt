In lively exchanges with the Conservative MP Anna Soubry, the former SNP leader remarked that the surge in support for the Nationalists in Scotland showed they had not really lost last September’s referendum after all.
But to Mr Salmond, who resigned as party leader not long afterwards, it simply marked another staging post on the road to separation.
In his interview, Mr Salmond said if the SNP held the balance, it would hold the power.
In normal times, expecting a Conservative to vote Labour or vice versa would be unreasonable; but these aren’t normal times.
To avert a crisis that will once again threaten the Union, a new and bold approach is needed to stop Mr Salmond in his tracks.
