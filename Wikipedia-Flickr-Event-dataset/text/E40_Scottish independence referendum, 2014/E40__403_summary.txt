Membership of the SNP has trebled since Scots voted to reject independence almost two weeks ago.
Almost 50,000 people have joined the party following the No vote on independence on September 18, taking the total membership to more than 75,000.
SNP business convener Derek Mackay said the surge in new members shows no signs of stopping.
He said: "The strong position of the SNP - standing at 49% in the polls - contrasts starkly with the Westminster parties.
The independence-supporting Scottish Greens have also experienced a surge in membership, with more than 6,000 now signed up to the party.
