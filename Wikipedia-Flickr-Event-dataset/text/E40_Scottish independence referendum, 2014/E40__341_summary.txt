The protest heard speeches and songs by Yes activists, who claimed BBC reporting showed an "unhealthy bias" towards the pro-UK campaign.
They accused the Yes campaign of attempting to "bully" the BBC.
Pro-independence campaigner and organiser Moira Williams told the BBC: "We organised this event because we are witnessing increasing discontent over BBC referendum coverage and we felt we needed to stand against this unhealthy bias.
Demonstrators, many wearing official Yes Scotland tee-shirts, carried flags and banners bearing slogans including: "BBC shame on you".
A BBC Scotland spokeswoman said: "Our coverage of the referendum story is fair and impartial in line with the editorial guidelines."
