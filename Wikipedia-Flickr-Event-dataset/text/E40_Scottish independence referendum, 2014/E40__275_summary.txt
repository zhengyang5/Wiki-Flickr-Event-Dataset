AN independent Scotland would have more than enough dedicated infrastructure and personnel to deliver pensions and other welfare benefits on day one, according to a Scottish Government-commissioned report published this week.
Most of the pensions handled by the Scottish offices are paid to people living in England.
Precisely which properties, staff and IT an independent Scotland would inherit would be subject to negotiation with Westminster.
Its remit included offering views on which of the UK Government's current reforms to working-age benefits "should be an immediate priority for change in an independent Scotland".
"The Scottish Government cannot avoid telling people in Scotland the hard facts about the level of welfare and pension payments in an independent Scotland."
