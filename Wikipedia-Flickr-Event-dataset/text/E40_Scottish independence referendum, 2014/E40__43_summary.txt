Harry Potter author JK Rowling has donated £1m to the Better Together campaign, which is opposed to Scottish independence.
But what are the rules and who are the donors, big and small?
The two official campaign groups, Better Together and Yes Scotland, can spend up to £1.5m each during that period.
All registered campaigners must report their campaign spending to the Electoral Commission as well as donations and loans over £7,500.
Scottish Labour gets to spend £831,000, the Scottish Conservatives £399,000 and the Scottish Liberal Democrats, £204,000.
