MPs on the Scottish affairs committee said the impact would be "far greater than that acknowledged by the Scottish government".
Scottish Education Secretary Mike Russell said the committee was mainly made up of anti-independence MPs.
It said that based on current student numbers it would cost Â£150m for Scotland to treat UK students the same as those from the EU.
"The Scottish government has a clear responsibility to tell the Scottish people how it would manage the damaging effects of changes in higher education and research that separation would bring."
A spokesman for pro-independence group, Academics for Yes, said the biggest threat to Scotland's higher education and research sector "comes from further Westminster cuts in 2015".
