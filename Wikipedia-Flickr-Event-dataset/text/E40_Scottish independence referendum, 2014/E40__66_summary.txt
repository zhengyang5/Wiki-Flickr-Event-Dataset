The MoD has repeatedly claimed in the House of Commons, and elsewhere, that they no longer produce spending statistics for the nations and regions of the UK – but this FOI shows they do.
The FOI adds £1.9bn more to the known underspend in the whole defence establishment in Scotland taking the total over ten years to 2012 to at least £7.4billion.
Commenting on the report’s findings, SNP Westminster Leader and Defence spokesperson Angus Robertson MP said:“The MoD has been caught red-handed.
“Worst of all these figures show the underspend in Scotland continues to fundamentally undermine any remaining defence case for the union.
“It is of course a devastating blow to unionist claims that Scotland gets a good deal on defence spending and totally exposes the deliberately misleading behaviour of the anti-independence parties.
