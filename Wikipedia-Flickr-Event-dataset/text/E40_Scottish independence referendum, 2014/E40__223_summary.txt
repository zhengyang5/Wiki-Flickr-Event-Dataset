ONE of the world’s most famous children’s hospitals has objected to a No vote advert for suggesting that Scots would join a “long list of foreigners” waiting for treatment after independence.
The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children has demanded that the advert produced by the non-party political Vote No Borders campaign be removed from cinemas.
One character asks if the NHS will still exist in the event of a Yes vote.
The other answers: “Aye, up to a point.”The first character then asks: “So if my family needs an expert at say the Marsden Cancer Hospital or Great Ormond Street?”He receives the reply: “They can join the long list of foreigners waiting to be seen.”A spokeswoman for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust said: “Great Ormond Street Hospital was not consulted about this advertising, and we in no way endorse its messages, or that of any other political campaign group.
In the same way that the Yes campaign can’t answer questions around pensions, the currency and the EU, there is uncertainty around health care.”
