THE HOUSE of Lords has been described as an “affront to democracy” by the SNP.
There are 59 Scottish MPs in the House of Commons with a total of 650 MPs and 785 Lords.

Last week, Liberal Democrat peer Lord Steel said that the law needed to be changed to allow peers - who are appointed for life - to retire.
“In the long run, of course, there has to be total reform of the House of Lords.’’
