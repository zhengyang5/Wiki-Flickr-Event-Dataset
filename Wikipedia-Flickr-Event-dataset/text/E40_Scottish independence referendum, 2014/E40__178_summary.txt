Standard & Poor's says high debt, oil prices and currency are risks, but Scotland has the capacity to make independence workAn independent Scotland would face “significant” challenges in its early years, according to an assessment by credit ratings agency Standard and Poor’s.
A report found Scotland would benefit from an economy the size of New Zealand’s, with a highly skilled workforce and strong democratic institutions.
Standard and Poor’s (S&P) said that sharing the pound with the rest of the UK would be an advantage in terms of Scotland’s credit rating, but could limit its monetary flexibility.
S&P said it was not passing judgement on the actual rating of an independent Scotland, and took no view on the merits or otherwise of independence.
Now one of the top ratings agencies has said this would impact on Scotland's credit rating.
