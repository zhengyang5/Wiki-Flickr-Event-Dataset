The proportion of undecided voters has slipped in this poll by six points, to 22%, as compared with TNS BMRB’s previous (regular) poll conducted towards the end of May.
That means Yes are up two on TNS BMRB’s previous poll, and No are up four.
For a campaign that according to some polls at least is still well behind, that will come as a disappointment.
Of the seven polls TNS BMRB have conducted so far this year, all but one of them has put Yes on 41% (and the single exception was a reading of 40%).
The TNS BRB poll was conducted over the period of a fortnight in the middle of June.
