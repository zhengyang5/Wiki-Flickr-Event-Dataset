The Scottish National Party's Westminster Spokesperson on Europe Mr Angus Robertson MP today [Thursday] accused New Labour of ducking the debate over the euro because they know that it marginalises the role and future of Westminster in Scotland.

Mr Robertson said:

"The key development across the European Union this New Year has been the euro becoming reality in 12 of the member states.

"Yet in the UK, the Government refuse to take a leadership position in the debate about our membership, despite their position in favour.

"New Labour's stance on the euro is half-hearted at best. In Scotland, an important reason for this dereliction of responsibility is because New Labour know that the euro debate and euro membership will marginalise the role of Westminster in Scotland.

"With powers moving from London to Scotland, and from London to Europe, UK membership of the euro will squeeze Westminster out of the process, and leave it with no future in Scotland.

"Euro membership hastens and facilitates the process of Scottish Independence by rendering Westminster redundant – New Labour know it, and are scared of the full implications of joining the single currency.

"UK membership of the euro will leave Westminster as an expensive, unnecessary and unwanted tier of government. It will make the case for an independent Scotland in Europe – alongside other nations in the euro such as Ireland, Austria, and Finland – unanswerable."
