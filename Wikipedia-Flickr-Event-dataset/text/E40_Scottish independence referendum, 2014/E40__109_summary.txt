The joint statement offering extra tax and legal powers for Scotland has also been signed by Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, in an orchestrated effort to shore up the no vote.
The clash comes 44 days before the referendum on 18 September and see will both Darling and Salmond quizzing each other after making opening statements.
Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie described the document as "a statement of common endeavour," but it was immediately attacked by the Scottish government.
"No one in Scotland will be fooled by this Westminster-led rehash of vague promises and unspecified more powers in the event of a no vote â€“ the Tories have tried that before," Salmond's spokesman said.
Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, said these findings added to the pressure on Salmond to defend his economic predictions for independence in tonight's debate.
