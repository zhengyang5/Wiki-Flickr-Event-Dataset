Scotland’s historic election on independence did not meet international standards for constitutional referendums, the head of a Russian voting rights organization has said, with procedures that left the result subject to rigging and vote-tampering.
The unusual criticism comes just months after the international community rejected the results of a referendum in Crimea.
Borisov noted that the vote-counting room was the size of an “aircraft hangar,” which opened up the democratic process to tampering.
“Even if you want to, it’s impossible to tell what’s happening,” he said.
“It’s also unclear where the boxes with ballot papers come from.”[Ria Novosti]
