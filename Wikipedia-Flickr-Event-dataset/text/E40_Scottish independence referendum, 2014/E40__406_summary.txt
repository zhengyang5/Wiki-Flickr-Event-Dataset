A new grassroots campaign for the Union will identify constituencies around Scotland in which tactical voting could be used in the general election to defeat the SNP.
Scottish Labour has also warned that any voter who wants to “stop the Tories” being the biggest party should vote for it.
The organisation will be launched later this week, and by the end of the week plans to publish a paper on its view on tactical voting.
Mr Cameron, a management consultant in Edinburgh, added: “We are very aware that tactical voting is not for everybody, we are totally understanding of the main parties rejecting it, because of course they would.
Felicity Kane, of Scotland in Union, who works in marketing, said the SNP was a united party against divided parties, and the new group hoped to create one voice.
