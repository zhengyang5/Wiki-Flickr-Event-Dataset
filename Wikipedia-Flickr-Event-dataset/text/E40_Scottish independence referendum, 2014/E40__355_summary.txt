YouGov have so far been amongst the more conservative of the pollsters so far as its estimate of the Yes vote is concerned.
Since September, most of its polls have put the Yes vote at between 38 and 40 per cent (once Don’t Knows were excluded).
So while it may be modest, the increase in the Yes vote registered in the company’s latest poll today for The Times is still notable.
Once the Don’t Knows are excluded this equates to a 42% Yes vote.
This is the largest Yes vote yet to have been recorded by YouGov.
