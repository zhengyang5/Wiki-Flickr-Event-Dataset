Sir Ranulph, who has broken world records and led expeditions to remote regions, will work with volunteers at Gretna on the monument, which is expected to need hundreds of thousands of stones to complete.

His involvement on Monday was confirmed following a gathering of a big crowd at the site, on a field near the M74.

They were there to lay the foundation stone of what has been called the Auld Acquaintance Cairn, with people travelling from across the UK to bring their own stones.

The foundation ceremony at the weekend was marked with a crowd of about 500 people linking arms in a circle three deep to sing Auld Lang Syne.

People have been invited to continue to visit the site to add their stones.

Penrith and the Border MP Rory Stewart, who is campaigning to maintain the union, is behind the idea.

He said: “I am overwhelmed at the turnout.

“The Auld Acquaintance is about showing that we are proud to be British and proud of our union and it will be a permanent marker of the strong love and affection we feel for Scotland.

“For the next two months we will be building our cairn on the precise border of England and Scotland.

“We want to encourage anyone who wants to make a peaceful statement about our union to please come and place their stone right here on this monument.”

At the event Mr Stewart was joined by politicians from across the political spectrum and from different sides of the border.

Historians Simon Schama, David Starkey, Max Hastings and Antony Beevor, the philosopher AC Grayling and the writer Alain de Botton are among those who have contributed stones to the cairn.
