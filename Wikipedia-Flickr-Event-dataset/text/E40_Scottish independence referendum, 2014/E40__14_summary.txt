Alex Salmond has outlined a timetable for the independence referendum â€” just minutes after the UK Government insisted it would be illegal.
During a day of dramatic developments that left Scotland mired in constitutional chaos he said the poll will be held in autumn 2014.
It is my task to ensure that this referendum is made in Scotland, by the people of Scotland, for the future of Scotland.''
The process would set terms of reference for the referendum before devolving the responsibility of calling the poll to Edinburgh.
An early referendum is essential to resolve this uncertainty and to give Scotland the opportunity to decide its own future.
