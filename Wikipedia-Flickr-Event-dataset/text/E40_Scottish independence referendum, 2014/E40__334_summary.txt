SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE: An academic has accused BBC Scotland of “thought control” and “suppressing” critical research which he published into coverage of the independence referendum on TV news.
Professor John Robertson’s report claimed the organisation’s reporting was “unfair” to the Yes campaign, with Alex Salmond portrayed as a “figure of fun”.
The “personalisation” of Alex Salmond in the media was also a key concern raised by the academic.
BBC Scotland’s head of news and current affairs, John Boothman, denied the study had been suppressed, pointing out that Prof Robertson had discussed it on BBC Radio Scotland’s flagship morning news show and that it was debated in phone-ins.
BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie said: “We completely reject the allegations about our news coverage, as we do the questioning of our journalists’ professionalism and what they have brought to air.
