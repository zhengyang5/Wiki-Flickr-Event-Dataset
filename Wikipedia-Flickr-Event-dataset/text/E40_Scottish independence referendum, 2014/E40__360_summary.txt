More than three years after Alex Salmondâ€™s Scottish National Party secured a landslide victory at Holyrood, the long-awaited referendum on independence is finally taking place.
Polling stations opened at 7am and closed at 10pm, with the result expected to be known by breakfast time today.
The turnout is expected to be high, with 4,285,323 people registered to vote, according to the Electoral Commission, and 16- and 17-year-olds able to take part for the first time.
The number of ballot papers in each box will be counted by a 5,767-strong counting team and the total will be reported to the chief counting officer (CCO) who will authorise the local counting officer to announce the turnout.
Chief Counting Officer Mary Pitcaithly will announce the will of the nation at the Royal Highland Centre outside Edinburgh tomorrow morning.
