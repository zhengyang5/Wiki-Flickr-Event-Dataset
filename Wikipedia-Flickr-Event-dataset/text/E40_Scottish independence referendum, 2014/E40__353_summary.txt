The “yes” vote (a vote to secede) had “virtually no chance” of prevailing, I said.
To be clear, most of the polls had “no” ahead in the closing days of the campaign.
This potentially leads to a double-counting of enthusiastic voters if turnout models are not applied carefully.
Furthermore, many polls of the Scottish independence referendum were Internet-based, and some of those polls did not use probability sampling, historically the bedrock for demographic weighting.
Less enthusiastic voters — Shy Unionists?
