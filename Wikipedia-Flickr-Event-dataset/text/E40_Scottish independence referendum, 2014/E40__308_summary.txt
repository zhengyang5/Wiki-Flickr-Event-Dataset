On Monday, September 29th we held a very proud and positive meeting of the Yes Scotland advisory board.
Thank you all, for the great contribution you made to the independence cause.
In accepting the result of the independence referendum, there is a great desire to build on the many positives of the Yes campaign.
We know that many local Yes groups are continuing to meet and that the political parties involved in the Yes movement are seeing huge increases in membership.
We thank you most sincerely for what you have done already for the Yes campaign, and for what you will do in the future.
