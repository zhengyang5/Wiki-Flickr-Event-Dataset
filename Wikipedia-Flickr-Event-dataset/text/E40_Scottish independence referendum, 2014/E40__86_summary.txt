Alex Salmond has been warned by a UK cabinet minister it would be "extraordinarily difficult" for an independent Scotland to join Nato at the same time as banning nuclear weapons.
They were told that new Nato members are expected not to "import problems" into the alliance, sources said, and to avoid any actions which undermined its nuclear-armed doctrine.
As her government faced attacks from both allies and critics over its stance on Nato, Sturgeon said that David Cameron had already agreed that his government would honour a yes vote.
Rennie added: "If the SNP want to ditch Trident they'd need to ditch Nato too.
Leaving Nato would leave Scotland without the cornerstone of defence in Europe, potentially exposing us to considerable threats."
