Scotland could lose key contracts to build new Royal Navy ships if it votes in favour of independence in next year's referendum, Cabinet ministers forecast today.
Their warning came after the Government announced it was protecting shipbuilding jobs in Glasgow while scrapping them in Portsmouth.
Mr Carmichael told the Commons it would be "difficult to see how the work would go to Scotland" if it was independent.
The decision was taken against the backdrop of polls indicating a comfortable majority in Scotland among opponents of independence.
Mr Cameron's official spokesman refused to deny the independence referendum had been a factor in safeguarding Scottish shipbuilding.
