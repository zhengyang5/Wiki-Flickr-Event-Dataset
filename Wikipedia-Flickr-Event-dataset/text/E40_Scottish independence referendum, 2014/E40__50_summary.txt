The UK and Scottish governments have finally agreed a form of words to explain what will happen after the independence referendum.
It said: "If more people vote 'Yes' than vote 'No' in the referendum, Scotland would become an independent country.
If you vote "Yes", Scotland will be independent.
After independence, the Scottish government would "become responsible for all aspects of government in Scotland," it stated.
The statement does not mention the Scottish government's proposed date of 24 March 2016 as Scotland's independence day.
