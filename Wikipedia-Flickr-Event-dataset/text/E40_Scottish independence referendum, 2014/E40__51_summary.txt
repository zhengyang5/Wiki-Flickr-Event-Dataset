Scotland will not get another chance to become independent if it chooses to remain as part of the United Kingdom, David Cameron has suggested.
In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said that the referendum will be "decisive, legal, fair, irreversible and binding".
Mr Cameron said: "I think giving them a referendum that is decisive, legal, fair, irreversible and binding – that is the right thing to do.
I was quite struck when in Scotland last week that every single school that has had a debate on the referendum has voted to stay in the United Kingdom.
It’s not about anything else.”He made the comments as Alex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister, said that Mr Cameron had "lost control" of the European debate.
