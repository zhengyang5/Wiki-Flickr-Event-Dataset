The leader of the Yes campaign has said he did not believe the BBC showed bias in its coverage of the independence referendum.
Blair Jenkins, the chief executive of Yes Scotland, said the broadcaster has not shown any systemic bias, but criticised "mistakes" in their reporting.
Many supporters of Yes claimed the corporation had showed favouritism towards the No campaign, and a number of demonstrations were held outside the BBC Scotland building in Glasgow.
"We had issues from time to time, but I don't myself that we faced a systemic bias if you like, that there was some corporate intent to disadvantage the Yes campaign.
"Knowing how both STV and the BBC operate, and knowing a lot of the people involved I don't think that's a credible view."
