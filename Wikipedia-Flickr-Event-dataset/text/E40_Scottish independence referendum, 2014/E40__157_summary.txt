Shadow chancellor says nationalists want to dismantle the very things that make a shared currency workEd Balls has challenged Alex Salmond's plans for a new sterling currency union after independence, warning that the first minister's "strange" proposal is "difficult and uncertain".
Balls said the eurozone crisis had proven that a shared currency only worked successfully with ever closer political, monetary and economic union â€“ the exact opposite of the Scottish National party's project.
"The promise that Scotland would continue to share a currency with the remainder of the UK simply isn't one the nationalists can make.
In fact they insist that that move would give Scotland greater economic freedoms than at present, with significant benefits and flexibility.
"Whatever currency option Scotland ends up with after an independence vote, it will be less advantageous than what we have across the UK today.
