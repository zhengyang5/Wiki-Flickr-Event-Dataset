The Absolutely Fabulous star has come out in support of the Auld Acquaintance cairn being created on the England-Scotland border at Gretna.

Itâ€™s being built as part of a push spearheaded by Penrith and the Border MP Rory Stewart ahead of Scotland going to the polls in an independence referendum in September.

Lumley has close links to Dumfriesshire and has been a key player in a charity formed to save the house said to have inspired JM Barrie to write Peter Pan in Dumfries.

She will be at the cairn to meet those behind it and show her support by bringing stones from her garden to add to it on Thursday.

On Monday, legendary explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes will visit to lend his support to the campaign.
