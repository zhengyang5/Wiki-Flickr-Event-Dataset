Explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes will visit a cairn on the England-Scotland border celebrating the strong bonds of the UK ahead of a vote on Scottish independence.
His involvement on Monday was confirmed following a gathering of a big crowd at the site, on a field near the M74.
They were there to lay the foundation stone of what has been called the Auld Acquaintance Cairn, with people travelling from across the UK to bring their own stones.
Penrith and the Border MP Rory Stewart, who is campaigning to maintain the union, is behind the idea.
â€œFor the next two months we will be building our cairn on the precise border of England and Scotland.
