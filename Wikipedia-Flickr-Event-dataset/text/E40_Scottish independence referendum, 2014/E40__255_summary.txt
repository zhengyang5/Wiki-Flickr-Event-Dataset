ORKNEY, Shetland and the Western Isles will be given more powers in a ground-breaking Islands Act in the event of a Yes vote in the independence referendum in 2014.
The Scottish Government made the new commitment at a meeting with the leaders of Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles councils.
It is a further boost for their campaign, which was launched earlier this year, to enable the islands' councils to decide their own futures.
Steven Heddle, convener of Orkney Islands Council said: "The three islands' councils maintain their position that there should be legislation within the lifetime of this parliament regardless of the outcome of the referendum while also respecting the political position of the Scottish Government."
The leader of the islands' councils are also in a continuing dialogue with the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael.
