HIGH-PROFILE campaigns to encourage tactical voting in a bid to counter the SNP surge fell flat on Thursday, with numbers uniting behind unionist candidates proving woefully insufficient in preventing a nationalist landslide.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats, the party that had called most loudly and explicitly for tactical voting in the 11 seats it held, saw its key strategy backfire.
The party had believed that tactical voting could lead to a victory in Gordon for Christine Jardine who was battling Alex Salmond.
Some right wing newspapers had produced tactical voting guides in an attempt to prevent SNP victories while some voluntary groups sprung up and attempted to organise co-ordinated efforts among unionists.
It's not impossible to believe that the Edinburgh South constituency was saved by tactical voting.
