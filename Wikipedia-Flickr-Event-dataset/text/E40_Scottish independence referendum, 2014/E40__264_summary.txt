We invited two senior academics to debate whether a vote for independence will jeopardise research funding in Scotland.
In that time Scottish science has grown in stature, backed largely with funding from research councils and charities based in the UK.

The research councils are shared assets of the union and the Scottish government's preferred option is a shared research councils' budget.
Adrian Bird: Research funding will follow excellence, if that funding is accessible.
