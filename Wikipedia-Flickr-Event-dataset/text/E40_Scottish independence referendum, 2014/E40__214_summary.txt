But if, hypothetically, the UK did leave the EU is Nicola Sturgeon correct in arguing that it is in Scotland's interests to stay in the EU?
The following chart, constructed from the recently published Scotland Global Connections 2011 highlights the importance of trade with rest of UK compared to EU trade.
Moreover, the importance of rest of UK exports to Scotland is rising while the share of exports to the EU has fallen over the period.
On the other hand, foreign investment and skilled labour immigration to Scotland from the EU and other countries could be damaged if Scotland left the EU.
And, the impact of Scotland in-rUK out on Scottish trade might be softened if a free trade arrangement was negotiated by rUK with the EU.
