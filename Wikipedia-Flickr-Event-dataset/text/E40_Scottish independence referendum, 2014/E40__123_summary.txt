The UK government's Trade and Investment Minister Lord Green called the figures "a vote of confidence" from foreign investors.
The Scottish government said the figures showed that the possibility of independence for Scotland had not reduced inward investment.
Finance Secretary John Swinney said the UKTI report "provides welcome recognition that Scotland is out-performing the UK at securing inward investment".
"With the full fiscal and economic powers of independence, the Scottish government could do even more to strengthen international investment."
