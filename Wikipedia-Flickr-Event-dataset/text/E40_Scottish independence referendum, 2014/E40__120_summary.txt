So what would an independent Scotland look like?
Among the blizzard of contention and spin that surrounds the independence debate, some points of broad consensus are clear.
If its geographic share of UK oil and gas output is taken into account, Scotland’s GDP per head is bigger than that of France.
Oil, whisky and a broad range of manufactured goods mean an independent Scotland would be one of the world’s top 35 exporters.
An independent Scotland could also expect to start with healthier state finances than the rest of the UK.
