Image caption The Scottish Parliament elections will be held on 5 May 2011A bill to hold an independence referendum will not be put to a vote before the 2011 elections, the Scottish government has confirmed.
Ms Sturgeon said it had become clear that plans for a referendum bill could not get through the current parliament.
The proposed independence bill has been consistently opposed by the Tories, Liberal Democrats and Labour at Holyrood.
The first question in the bill would see voters asked if they backed increased powers for the Scottish Parliament.
The second question would then ask whether the parliament's powers "should also be extended to enable independence to be achieved".
