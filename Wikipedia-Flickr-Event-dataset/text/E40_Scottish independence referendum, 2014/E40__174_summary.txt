SCOTS will not be told the cost of setting up an independent Scotland before they go to the polls in September's referendum, the Scottish Government has admitted.
The First Minister's chief political spokesman said no figure for the cost of creating new government departments and public bodies had been calculated.
Pressed later, his chief political spokesman said: "The work taken forward by the Scottish Government informed the White Paper.
We have published in the White Paper the shape and structure of an independent Scotland and the government apparatus it would require, as we see it."
The Scottish Government says an independent Scotland would be entitled to a £110bn share of the UK's estimated £1.3 trillion assets.
