The BBC faces accusations of anti-independence bias after its political editor, Nick Robinson, produced a report that wrongly claimed Alex Salmond had ignored his question during a heated press conference.
The exchange between Robinson and Salmond came after the BBC reported that a UK Treasury source said the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) would move its headquarters to London if Scots voted for independence.
At the press conference, Robinson asked Salmond how Scottish taxpayers would make up the loss of tax revenue.
The First Minister then went on the attack, calling for a leaks inquiry into who from the Treasury briefed the BBC about the RBS announcement.
This is the first opportunity the BBC have had to heckle at a meeting,‚Äù Salmond said, laughing.
