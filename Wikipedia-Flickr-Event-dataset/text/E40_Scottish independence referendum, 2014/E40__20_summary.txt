Convicted murderers Leslie Moohan and Andrew Gillon claimed the ban amounted to a human rights breach.
But the judge's conclusions have now been upheld by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord President Lord Gill, along with Lady Paton and Lord Menzies.
They argued the right had been breached because of the blanket ban on convicted prisoners voting in the referendum.
"Thus, in our opinion, no such right is contravened by the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Act 2013."
