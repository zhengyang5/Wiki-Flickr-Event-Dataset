The British government would expect passport checks between Scotland and England if a looser immigration policy were adopted north of the border after independence, according to the home secretary, Theresa May.
"Buried deep in Alex Salmond's white paper is the admission that, just like the last Labour government, a separate Scotland would pursue a looser immigration policy.
"So that would mean border controls between a separate Scotland and the United Kingdom," she said.
In January, Alistair Carmichael, the Scotland secretary, had agreed it would make sense for Scotland to join the Common Travel Area provided it dropped plans to have more liberal, open immigration rules than the UK.
Last month, David Cameron told journalists in Scotland that the UK would actually support Scotland's application to join the EU, implying it would smooth the way for a quick accession.
