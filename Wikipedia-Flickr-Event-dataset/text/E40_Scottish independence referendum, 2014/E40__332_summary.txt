A Scottish council has apologised and begun an investigation for an offensive Tweet directed at Alistair Darling during Monday's TV referendum debate.
This coincided with Better Together leader Mr Darling going head-to-head with Yes campaign leader Alex Salmond in the BBC live debate in Glasgow.
Mr Salmond and Mr Darling made their pitch to voters before an audience of 200 in Glasgow.
A snap poll by The Guardian newspaper and polling company ICM suggested 71% of those polled thought Mr Salmond had come out on top in the debate, against 29% for Mr Darling.
