Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, which consists of all the member states’ leaders, said he agreed with Mr Barroso.
“The euro is not just another policy of the union, there is an aim of all member states to share a common currency.
A Yes Scotland spokesman said: "There is no way that the EU won't want to keep oil-rich, fishing-rich, renewable energy-rich Scotland.
And we will keep the pound, because joining the euro is entirely voluntary - as the example of Sweden shows.
We have no intention of joining the euro, and don't even qualify for membership even if we did."
