A secretive group is beginning campaigning in Scotland this week with a simple mission: stopping the SNP by encouraging tactical voting.
The group has around 2,000 supporters on Facebook and says it is planning to begin door-knocking in seats where it thinks tactical voting could make a difference.
Are any of you Labour party members?
We realised that to stop the SNP requesting another referendum and breaking up the UK we would have to limit their impact through tactical voting.
In areas where there was a Yes vote tactical voting is unlikely to work but we still encourage it.
