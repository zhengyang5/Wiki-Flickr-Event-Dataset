An independent Scotland would have about 100 embassies and consular offices around the world, compared with the UK’s 270, Nicola Sturgeon has revealed.
Critics also said the cost of a new internal security service could run into “billions of pounds”, and warned that United States agencies might not let Scotland see sensitive intelligence reports.
The Deputy First Minister said Scotland would have its own security service to fight international threats such as terrorism, cyber attacks and serious organised crime.
Asked whether Scotland would attempt to set up an “external security service”, she said that was “one option available to Scotland”.
“An independent Scotland would not replicate that sort of network,” he warned.
