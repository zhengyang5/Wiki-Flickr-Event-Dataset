David Cameron will engage in a high-risk rebuttal of Scottish independence on Thursday, when he'll make a speech in Scotland which warns of the nation being marginalised at the UN Security Council and among NATO.
Number 10 was quick to clarify that there was no suggestion that a post-independence UK would lose its seat on the UN Security Council.
But Britain's place there - considered increasingly tenuous given its relative wane as a global power - depends on its nuclear arsenal.
In traveling to Scotland to deliver a firm and personal riposte to rising sentiment there towards leaving the UK, Cameron is taking a significant risk.
The most recent poll on Scottish independence - released on the 5th of February - suggested Scots favoured staying within the UK by a margin of 5%.
