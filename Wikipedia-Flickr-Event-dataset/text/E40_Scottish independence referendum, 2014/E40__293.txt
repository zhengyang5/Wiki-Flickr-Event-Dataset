Modelling themselves after the last-minute Unity Rally that took place in Quebec before the 1995 Independence Referendum in Canada, rallies took place in several UK cities to prevent the break-up of the United Kingdom.

Taking place in London, Bristol, Leeds, Cardiff, Manchester and Belfast, the rallies saw thousands across the country join together to raise their spirits before tomorrow’s referendum.

The London rally, which occurred in Kings Cross Square, saw hundreds of people come to listen to speakers urge those attending to speak to their Scottish friends and relatives and to keep Scotland part of the United Kingdom.

However, the rally was temporarily disrupted by a small group of Yes voters, shouting down the speaker with cries of: “Aye or Die”. The group were quickly removed.

Rallies in other cities across the UK were similarly attended, with one attendee of the Leeds Rally saying to the Telegraph: “People were ranging from anger that Salmond was ruining the country that beat Napoleon and Hitler to sadness that our family was being torn apart.

“My brother’s wife is Scottish, and his three children have no say in losing part of their identity.”

One of the organisers of the Day of Unity Rallies, handing out Saltires and Union Jacks, said: “Most people outside Scotland haven’t been given a voice, haven’t been given a say.

“We are trying to show that we feel about our country is more than just a flag.

“Even if sometimes we don’t notice Scotland in everything that we do, the red white and blue are everywhere.

“There’s no getting away from that.”

Polls in Scotland open at 7am tomorrow, and close at 10pm.

The overall result is expected to be announced at 6am on Friday morning.
