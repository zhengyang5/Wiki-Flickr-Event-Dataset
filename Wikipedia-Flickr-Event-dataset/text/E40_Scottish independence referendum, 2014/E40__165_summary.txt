"If UK debt were shared on a per capita basis, an independent Scotland might inherit a slightly smaller debt-to-GDP ratio than that faced by the UK."
However, the IFS said oil and gas revenues were "very volatile" and this could pose problems for an independent Scotland.
In the mid-1980s, if oil and gas revenues had been allocated on a geographical basis, they would have accounted for nearly half of Scottish revenue.
There would be a further problem when the oil and gas started to run out, the IFS said.
"If, as is likely, oil and gas revenues fall over the long run, then the fiscal challenge facing Scotland will be greater than that facing the UK."
