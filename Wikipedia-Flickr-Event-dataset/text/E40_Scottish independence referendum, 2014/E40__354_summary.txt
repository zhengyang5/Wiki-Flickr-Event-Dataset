Until now, one of the most remarkable features of the opinion polls on how people propose to vote in the referendum on Scottish independence has been their stability.
There are now though consistent signs of movement in favour of a "yes" vote, movement that follows on from the publication of the Scottish government's White Paper on independence at the end of November.
On average the five post-White Paper polls have put the "yes" vote at 39%, up three points on the equivalent figure recorded by those same polls in the early autumn.
