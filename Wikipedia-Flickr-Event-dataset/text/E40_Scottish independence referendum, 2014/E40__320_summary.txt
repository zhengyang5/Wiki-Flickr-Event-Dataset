ALISTAIR Darling has accused Alex Salmond of “running scared” of a series of live TV debates between the pair on Scottish independence prior to next year’s referendum.
The leader of the Better Together campaign said he would be writing again to Salmond to propose a head-to-head debate.
Alex Salmond has a vote, so he should have the courage of his convictions and be prepared to debate this.”Describing a televised debate as the best way to flush out the issues, he said: “It is extraordinary that Alex ­Salmond is not prepared to ­debate with people in Scotland these big issues.
He said the only person he’s willing to debate with is David Cameron.
“If the prime minister is so confident about his case against independence, what has he got to be afraid of?”
