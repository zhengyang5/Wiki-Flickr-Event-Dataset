Ministers also argued that start-up costs would be lower because they were planning to run a slimmed-down system, with many of the required public bodies already existing in Scotland.
Mr Swinney's complaint came ahead of the publication of the Treasury's latest analysis on the costs of independence over a 20-year period from 2016 to 2035/36.
