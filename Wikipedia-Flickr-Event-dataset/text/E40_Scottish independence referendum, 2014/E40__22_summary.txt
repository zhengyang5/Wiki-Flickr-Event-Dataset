Lowering the voting age gives these young people the chance to have their say over the society they want to be part of.
Polls of those below 18 don't find any great support for lowering to 16 either.
Most 18 to 24-year-olds don't vote in general elections, they either aren't registered or they don't turn out so their effect is much less than older people.
Several countries in Latin America have either lowered the voting age or attempted to do so in recent years.
However, despite this reality governments in Latin America - and other regions - are actively promoting the reduction of the voting age population to under 18's.
