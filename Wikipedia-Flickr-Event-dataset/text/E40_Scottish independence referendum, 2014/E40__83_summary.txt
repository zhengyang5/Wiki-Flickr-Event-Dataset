Members of the Scottish National Party have voted to ditch their 30-year policy of opposition to defence alliance Nato.
The motion to support Angus Robertson's Nato policy change was passed by 426 votes to 332 votes.
It would also be dependent on Scotland's refusal to host nuclear weapons in the future, Mr Robertson.
He told the gathering: "This defence policy sends a very important message to people in Scotland and to friends, neighbours and allies.
"This self-styled defence policy update is not in that distinct social justice vein - it's more of the same UK."
