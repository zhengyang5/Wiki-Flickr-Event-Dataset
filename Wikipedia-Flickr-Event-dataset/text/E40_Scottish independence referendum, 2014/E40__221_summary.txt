Six in 10 doctors working in Scotland will not vote for independence in next month’s referendum, a poll has shown.
The results suggest that the doctors surveyed are more staunchly opposed to independence than the overall population of Scotland.
Nine out of 10 of the doctors intending to vote no said they believed the economy would suffer under independence.

Among “yes” voters, one responder said independence “could make it easier for Scotland to tailor health and social care to what is needed.
