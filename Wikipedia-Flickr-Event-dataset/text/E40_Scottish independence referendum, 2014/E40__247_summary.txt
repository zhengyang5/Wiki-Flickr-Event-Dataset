Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles should be given a referendum on whether to become independent from Scotland, according to a new petition lodged with at Holyrood.
It suggests that a week after Scotland's independence referendum this September the islands' voters should get to decided whether to remain part of Scotland.
The electorate would be asked whether to stay in Scotland, become independent or – in the case of a Yes vote – leave Scotland but remain part of the UK.
He challenged Alex Salmond to confirm the SNP administration’s policy towards the islands in the event of Scottish independence.
Mr Salmond's spokesman said Mr Scott was "mischief making", adding that Shetland was and would remain a valued part of Scotland.
