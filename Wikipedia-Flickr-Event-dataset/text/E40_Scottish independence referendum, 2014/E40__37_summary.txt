Image caption Mr Harvie said Yes Scotland was now a truly inclusive campaignThe Scottish Greens have formally voted to participate in the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign for independence.
Delegates backed the movement at their party conference in Glasgow, some four months after Yes Scotland was launched.
"We look forward to working with Yes Scotland to set out a transformational vision for Scotland's society, economy and environment, and building a campaign to win."
The party also decided to form its own pro-independence campaign to run alongside Yes Scotland, designed to promote distinct policies.
Welcoming the decision by the Greens, Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins said: "The momentum is very much with the Yes campaign and this extremely welcome development is another tremendous boost as we continue to build the largest community-based campaign in Scotland's history."
