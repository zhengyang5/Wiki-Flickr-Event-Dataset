Since the Government introduced devolution, a democratic deficit hascrept back into the United Kingdom which challenges all the reformingand democratic improvements of our electoral process over the last 150years.
On the border with Wales, we see the effects of this democratic deficitevery day, and by devolution.
Wales has free parking in hospitals, noprescription charges, free dental examinations for OAPs, whilst Welshstudents pay no top-up fees at Welsh universities.
Furthermore, the fees thatEnglish students pay were voted through with the help of Welsh MPs.
Conservatives are considering the creation of an EnglishGrand Committee, so that English MPs will get a chance to vote onlegislation that affects England only, thereby making Westminster moreaccountable to people living in England.
