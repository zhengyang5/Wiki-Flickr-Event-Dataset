First Minister Alex Salmond has come under opposition pressure to set out the start-up costs of an independent Scottish state.
The Tory and Lib Dem leaders said Scottish ministers had failed to come up with a figure, despite saying it was being worked on two years ago.
The UK Treasury has published analysis which put the cost at £1.5bn.
But Mr Salmond has strongly disputed the figures, accusing UK ministers of peddling misinformation on the issue.
The academic later "guesstimated" the Scottish cost could be between £150m and £200m - a suggestion Mr Salmond agreed with.
