Blow to Alex Salmond's 2020 renewables target as energy secretary rules out billions in UK energy subsidies upon yes voteThe energy secretary Ed Davey has rejected Scottish government calls for the UK to continue subsidising Scottish energy projects after independence, warning he would withdraw billions of pounds in investment.
"Alex Salmond shouldn't be gambling with the energy bills of the people of Scotland," Davey said, as he published a new analysis paper on independence by the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
If Scotland did become independent, Davey said UK ministers and energy companies would search for the most competitive European energy sources to supplement UK production.
Although Ewing argues that Scotland exports a quarter of its electricity, Davey said that that meant Scotland supplied less than 5% of the rest of the UK's energy needs.
"Instead of accessing Scotland's reliable energy resources [Davey] is talking of importing energy over interconnectors that don't yet exist from the European mainland where many countries face similar energy supply concerns as the UK.
