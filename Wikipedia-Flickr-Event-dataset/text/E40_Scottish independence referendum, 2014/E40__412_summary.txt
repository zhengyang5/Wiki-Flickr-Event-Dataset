Mr Brown said there should be "no strings attached" to promises of more powers for Scotland.
And he claimed Conservative plans to devolve income tax were a "trap" which could result in Scottish MPs losing the right to vote on UK income tax.
Mr Brown claimed that "no party leader ever suggested" such conditions in discussions before the referendum.
The Conservatives' devolution commission has proposed giving the Scottish Parliament full income tax powers, making it accountable for 40% of the money it spent.
