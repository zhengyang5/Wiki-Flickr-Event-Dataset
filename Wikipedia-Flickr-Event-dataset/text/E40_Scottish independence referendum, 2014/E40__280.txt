The SNP is today highlighting the need for a Yes vote as the UK government’s welfare cuts have been condemned by a leading charity following the publication of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s report which reveals nearly 400,000 households in ­Scotland are living on incomes too low to afford an adequate standard of living ­.

These findings show an alarming 18% rise over three years - up 70,000 from 2008/9.

John Dickie, Head of Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, is reported in today’s Herald saying:

"The sharp rise in the number of families who don't have the income needed to meet the publicly accepted minimum standard of living is a result of the Coalition government's cuts to the tax credits and benefits families rely on whether they are in or out of work.”

Jamie Hepburn MSP, who is also Deputy Convener of the Welfare Reform Committee, said:

"For a country as rich in natural resources and talent as Scotland, a fifth of the population are being forced to live on inadequate incomes is totally unacceptable.

"The Westminster system’s relentless drive to continue slashing public spending was further cemented last week when UK chancellor George Osborne’s announced that he is to axe another £12Billion from the benefits bill.

"Labour are no better, Rachel Reeves – the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions – has already admitted that Labour would be ‘tougher’ on benefits.

"Only a Yes vote will deliver full control of the welfare system to the Scottish Parliament – a position supported 56% of people in Scotland. Only then will Scotland have the powers needed to guarantee that our most vulnerable individuals are protected."
