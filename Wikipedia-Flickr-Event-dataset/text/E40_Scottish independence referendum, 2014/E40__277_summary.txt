CHARITIES are calling for a Â­separate welfare state in Scotland, warning the situation where a Scottish government attempts to mitigate decisions made at Westminster is unsustainable.
A Scottish welfare state should be founded on a set of principles which laid out what people could expect from each other and the state, the authors said.
If the basic requirements of a uniquely Scottish welfare state can be identified, the impetus of the constitutional reform debate can lead to change whatever the referendum result next September, it says.
The argument about the affordability of the welfare state also ignores the costs created by cutting it, Mr Downie added.
Mr Downie also claimed a properly-designed Scottish welfare state could avoid creating a dependency culture, which was not what most claimants wanted.
