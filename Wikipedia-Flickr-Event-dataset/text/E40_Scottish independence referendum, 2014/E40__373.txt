NB: It is very important to note that whilst ballot boxes from polling stations were allocated and counted by area this was not the case for postal ballots which were simply distributed evenly across the four counting areas and any box could have contained votes from any area. Post ballots accounted for 14.3% of all votes cast. Accordingly, the above figures can only provide a broad indication of voting outcomes in each of the areas.

The count zones covered the following areas:

ZONE A - Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Northern Corridor

ZONE B - Coatbridge and part of Airdrie

ZONE C - Remainder of Airdrie, Shotts, Bellshill and Viewpark

ZONE D - Motherwell and Wishaw.

The above count zones reflect those contained in the Referendum count programme [6Mb].

In addition, detailed verification statements for the count including numbers of tendered ballot papers are available for download from the panel on the right.

Finally, it should be noted that it was not a requirement to produce and publish results at an area level and the above figures have been reported in an attempt to be helpful in addressing enquiries which have been received from a number of different sources requesting more detailed analysis.
