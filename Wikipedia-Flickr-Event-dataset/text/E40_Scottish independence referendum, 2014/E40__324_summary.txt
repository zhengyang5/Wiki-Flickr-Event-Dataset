Mr Darling, leader of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said independence campaigners had failed to answer key questions.
For his part, Alex Salmond urged Mr Darling to accept that Scotland could be a prosperous independent country.
Mr Salmond said SNP MPs would "vote for more powers" in the event of a "No" vote, but insisted: "We're anticipating a 'Yes' vote."
Mr Salmond said an independent Scotland could keep Sterling, insisting: "It is our pound as well as England's pound."
Mr Darling said there was a question mark over how long it would take an independent Scotland to become an EU member.
