Scottish independence would be costly and would lead to "major upheaval with uncertain consequences", according to a former senior government adviser.
Gavin McCrone, former chief economic adviser to the Scottish Office who also led the industry and development departments of the Scottish Government, has written a new book weighing up the economics of independence.
But he warns that promises of further devolution are likely to be shelved by the UK Government if Scotland votes no.
McCrone recognises that the proposals to break up Britain are half-baked and aren't in Scotland's interests."
Scottish Independence: Weighing Up The Economics, by Gavin McCrone, is due for release on August 1.
