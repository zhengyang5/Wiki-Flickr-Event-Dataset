LONDON (Reuters) - As the battle over Scottish independence heats up, residents of three groups of remote Scottish islands, some of which straddle oil and gas fields northeast of Britain, are calling for their own breakaway votes and greater autonomy.
A marker stone is seen at Carter Bar in the Scottish Borders August 22, 2013.
Tavish Scott, the Shetland’s representative in the devolved Scottish parliament, said Scotland does not have an economy without oil and gas, giving Shetland some leverage.
POLLS NARROWINGThe islands’ call for more power comes as the campaigns over Scottish independence gather pace, with separatists still trailing in opinion polls but gaining ground.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish parliament said more than 620 people had signed the petition since it opened for signatures on March 20.
