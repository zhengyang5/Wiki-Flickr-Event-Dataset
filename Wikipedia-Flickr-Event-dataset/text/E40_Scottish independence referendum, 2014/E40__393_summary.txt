THE SNP landslide at the General Election is evidence that the 2014 independence referendum was rigged, according to Russia's top elections official.
Commenting on the Nationalists' emphatic victory in Scotland, the official said: "It confirms our position; that the outcome of the independence referendum in Scotland was a total falsification."
Mr Churov noted how the election results showed "the SNP, which fought for a Yes in the referendum, won far more votes now than it did then".
He added: "In the election the voters were the people who actually live in Scotland and are British citizens.
But in the referendum all the EU citizens were able to vote, including several dozen thousand Poles working in Scotland."
