Much of this is fuelled by the availability of social media, allowing contributors anonymity to make personal attacks on individuals.
More widely, the NUJ asks the leadership on both sides to consider carefully the implications of their attacks on journalists for asking challenging questions.
They also need to respect the role of journalists in fairly moderating those debates, and refrain from intimidation and personal abuse.
There is an increasing trend towards the intimidation of BBC journalists, who are working hard to hold politicians of all sides to account in the referendum debate.
But NUJ members believe in a free press, a fair media, with journalists allowed to do their jobs free of intimidation.
