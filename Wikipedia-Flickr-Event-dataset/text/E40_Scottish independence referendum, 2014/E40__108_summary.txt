Image caption STV will host a live TV debate with Better Together's Alistair Darling and First Minister Alex SalmondA televised referendum debate between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling will go ahead next month after a dispute over dates was settled.
First Minister Mr Salmond will put the case for Scottish independence and Mr Darling, chairman of Better Together, will argue for the UK to stay together.
Mr Salmond had wanted to debate with Prime Minister David Cameron on the commercial station in July.
But Better Together said it had agreed with STV that former Labour chancellor Mr Darling would be going up against the SNP leader.
The two-hour live TV debate, to be hosted by STV political editor Bernard Ponsonby, will be broadcast in front of a 350-strong audience from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.
