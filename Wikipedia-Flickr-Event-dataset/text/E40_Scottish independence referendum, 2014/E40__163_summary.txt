The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said a currency union between an independent Scotland and the remainder of the United Kingdom would be incompatible with sovereignty, dealing a blow to Scottish nationalists before next week's referendum on independence.
"A currency union is incompatible with sovereignty."
Carney told the TUC a third test of a successful currency union was "some form of fiscal arrangement.
That's why a currency union would be bad for Scotland, as well as the rest of the UK.
The original version wrongly stated that Mark Carney had said a currency union would be unworkable.
