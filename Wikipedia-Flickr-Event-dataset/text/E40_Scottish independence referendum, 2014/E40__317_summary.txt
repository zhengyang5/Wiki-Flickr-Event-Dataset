He said Mr Salmond should instead debate with Alistair Darling, the head of the Better Together campaign.
Mr Salmond has now accused Mr Cameron of "seeking power without responsibility".
Mr Cameron said Mr Darling, the former Chancellor, had been asked by all of the pro-UK parties in Scotland to lead the No campaign.
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Cameron once again against dismissed suggestions that he should take part in a televised debate with Mr Salmond.
