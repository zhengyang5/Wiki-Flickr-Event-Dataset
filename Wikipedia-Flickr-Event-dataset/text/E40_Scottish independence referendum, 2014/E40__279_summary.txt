NICOLA Sturgeon will today set out the SNP's plans for scrapping the so-called bedroom tax in an independent Scotland.
The bedroom tax comes into effect on April 1 and is expected to affect about 105,000 working-age tenants in Scotland who live in social housing.
And let me be crystal clear, an SNP government in an independent Scotland will scrap the bedroom tax."
Although Sturgeon set up an expert working group to look at welfare options under independence, ending bedroom tax has been a ministerial decision, and is not the related to the expert group.
Alex Salmond yesterday said the nine SNP-led councils in Scotland would not evict their tenants for the first year of the bedroom tax if they got into arrears.
