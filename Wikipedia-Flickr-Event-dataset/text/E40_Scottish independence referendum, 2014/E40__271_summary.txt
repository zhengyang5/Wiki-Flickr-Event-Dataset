Plans for an independent Scotland to continue to charge tuition fees for university students from the rest of the UK “would be illegal”, a former European commissioner for education has claimed.
The SNP government white paper on independence set out plans to continue charging English students attending Scottish universities tuition fees while having free education for those from other EU nations.
Current EU rules prohibit states from discriminating on the grounds of nationality, meaning Scotland has to give fee-free university education to EU students from outside the UK in order to keep studying at university free for Scottish students.
But it can impose tuition fees on students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland because the EU does regulate for discrimination within member states.
Under European laws, Scottish ministers would need to make an “objective justification” for doing this.
