Some claimed an independent Scotland would suffer if the party’s stance was not changed, while others retorted the euro should be ruled out indefinitely.
Mr Swinney eventually got his way when delegates voted in favour of waiting until the economic conditions are right to join the euro, then holding a referendum.
The debate was led by delegate Ian Blackford, a former SNP treasurer, who told delegates euro membership may be necessary for Scotland to argue in Europe for reform of financial regulation.
“I cannot understand a position that says let's be independent but sterling is the best we can do,” Mr Ross added.
Mr Swinney said he is in favour of adopting the euro, but such a fundamental change would require a referendum of the Scottish people.
