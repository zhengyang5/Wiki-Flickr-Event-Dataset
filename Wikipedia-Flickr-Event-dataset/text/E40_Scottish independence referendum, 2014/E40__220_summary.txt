Â© STVHealthcare staff have formed a new group to campaign for a Yes vote in the independence referendum.
The group, which was formally launched in Glasgow on Saturday, said only independence can "protect" Scotland's health service from Westminster spending cuts.
"Privatisation and commercialisation are now rampant in the health service south of the border.
That is why it is vital that Scotland is in charge of all the revenue raised in Scotland with a Yes vote and independence.
"A Yes vote will give us the protection our health service needs."
