And Scotland wants to hold another stirring event in the autumn of 2014: a referendum on whether to quit the United Kingdom.
Like his hero Robert the Bruce, Mr Salmond starts this fight as an underdog.
The announcement of a 2014 date was bounced out of Mr Salmond after Mr Cameron said that a vote held without the authority of the British Parliament could be unlawful.
The pro-union parties dislike the vagueness of “devo max” and want to force Mr Salmond into a straight defeat on independence.
Westminster teasing about a “neverendum” aside, Mr Salmond will probably pick the date.
