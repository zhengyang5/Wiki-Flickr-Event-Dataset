Nicola Sturgeon and Michael Moore have clashed in the first major televised debate of the referendum campaign.
Ms Sturgeon and Mr Moore fielded questions from presenter and moderator John MacKay before grilling each other in a cross-examination.
The Scottish Secretary rejected Ms Sturgeon’s premise, saying: “That’s twice tonight you’ve accused me of scaremongering.
The Scottish Secretary had referred to Scotland "rip[ping] ourselves out" of the UK if it voted for independence.
Towards the end, I felt that Michael Moore was almost defending more in his questions than he was actually putting Nicola Sturgeon on the spot.”
