Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan, has welcomed the publication of the Scottish Government’s “immensely significant” white paper on Scottish independence and discussed the impact it could have on the Western Isles.
The beauty of independence is that Scotland will get the Government it votes for every time.
“The white paper is an immensely significant step towards this aim, and contains questions and answers on hundreds of aspects of what independence will mean for every family in the islands.
“As well as setting out the shape of independence, and the reasons why independence is the Scottish Governments policy, the paper also gives an indication of policies the Scottish Government would seek to bring forward once Scotland had the necessary powers to do so.
The white paper will I believe now provide the basis for a detailed and positive case for Scotland’s future to be in Scotland’s hands.”
