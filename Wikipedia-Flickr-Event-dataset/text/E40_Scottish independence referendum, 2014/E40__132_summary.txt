In Scotland, an important reason for this dereliction of responsibility is because New Labour know that the euro debate and euro membership will marginalise the role of Westminster in Scotland.
"With powers moving from London to Scotland, and from London to Europe, UK membership of the euro will squeeze Westminster out of the process, and leave it with no future in Scotland.
"Euro membership hastens and facilitates the process of Scottish Independence by rendering Westminster redundant – New Labour know it, and are scared of the full implications of joining the single currency.
"UK membership of the euro will leave Westminster as an expensive, unnecessary and unwanted tier of government.
It will make the case for an independent Scotland in Europe – alongside other nations in the euro such as Ireland, Austria, and Finland – unanswerable."
