Modelling themselves after the last-minute Unity Rally that took place in Quebec before the 1995 Independence Referendum in Canada, rallies took place in several UK cities to prevent the break-up of the United Kingdom.
Taking place in London, Bristol, Leeds, Cardiff, Manchester and Belfast, the rallies saw thousands across the country join together to raise their spirits before tomorrow’s referendum.
“My brother’s wife is Scottish, and his three children have no say in losing part of their identity.”One of the organisers of the Day of Unity Rallies, handing out Saltires and Union Jacks, said: “Most people outside Scotland haven’t been given a voice, haven’t been given a say.
“Even if sometimes we don’t notice Scotland in everything that we do, the red white and blue are everywhere.
“There’s no getting away from that.”Polls in Scotland open at 7am tomorrow, and close at 10pm.
