Alex Salmond's plans to defend an independent Scotland appear underfunded and are lacking in crucial detail, a parliamentary report says.
The Commons defence select committee was highly critical over the paucity of information produced by the Scottish National Party during the independence debate about its defence and security plans.
It said it unconvinced that the proposed Â£2.5bn budget was enough for a new Scottish defence force and to pay for new equipment such as submarines and fast jets.
The MPs warned that Scottish defence companies would face a difficult future in a breakaway nation as new contracts from Edinburgh would be dwarfed by the loss of orders from the UK Government.
The committee chairman, James Arbuthnot , said becoming nuclear-free could hamper Scotland's hopes of joining Nato.
