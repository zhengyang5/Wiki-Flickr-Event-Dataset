Image caption The referendum on Scottish independence will be held on 18 September next yearTwo murderers have lost a legal battle to win convicted prisoners the right to vote in next year's Scottish independence referendum.
The ban on convicted inmates voting in the referendum was challenged by Andrew Gillon and Leslie Moohan, along with long-term prisoner Gary Gibson.
The European Court of Human Rights has previously held that a blanket ban on prisoners voting is unlawful following a case brought by axe killer John Hirst.
The judge said it was quite possible that the Strasbourg court may one day rule that it also protects the right to vote in a referendum.
Lord Glennie said he had effectively been asked to hold that Westminster in imposing the prisoners' voting ban was acting unconstitutionally, but said that was "an untenable position".
