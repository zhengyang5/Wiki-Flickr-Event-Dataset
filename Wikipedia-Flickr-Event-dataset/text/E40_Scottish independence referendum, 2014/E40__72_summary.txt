BAE Systems said it expects to have about 25 design development agreements in place by the end of this year.
Earlier this year BAE Systems revealed that it was looking at two possible Type 26 build strategies, both centred on the Clyde.
"This will create a 21st-century complex warship facility for Type 26 and beyond, and allow us to build Type 26 in the most efficient manner possible," he said.
We are looking to start work on the redevelopment in early 2015 to allow Type 26 manufacture to start in May 2016."
Searle insisted that BAE Systems had "no 'Plan B'" for the build of Type 26 elsewhere in the United Kingdom should Scotland vote to secede.
