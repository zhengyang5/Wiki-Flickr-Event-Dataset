Sir Craig Reedie, of the International Olympic Committee, says athletes would "have no alternative".
SNS GroupScottish athletes may have no choice but to compete for Great Britain rather than a newly-independent nation at the next Olympic Games in 2016, according to a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
Sir Craig said: "In my view, whether there is a referendum or not, the independent recognition by the international community will take a lot longer than 2014.
He defended the existing set-up and questioned whether Scotland could afford to fund elite sports to the same extent.
Sir Craig highlighted the gold medal for rowing won by Katherine Grainger with England's Anna Watkins.
