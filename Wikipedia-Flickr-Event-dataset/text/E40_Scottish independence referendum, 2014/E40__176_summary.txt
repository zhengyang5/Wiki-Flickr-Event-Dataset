Image caption Prof Patrick Dunleavy, of the London School of Economics, has been looking at the costs of Scottish independenceThe total cost of establishing an independent Scottish state would be between £600m and £1.5bn in the first 10 years, an academic has said.
He previously put the initial cost at £200m, in the event of a "Yes" vote in the September independence referendum.
Prof Dunleavy said the final bill depended on issues like negotiations between Scottish and UK ministers.
The pro-Union Better Together campaign said the figure showed that Scottish independence would be a "costly business".
He has now put the "total transition costs" at between £600m and £1.5bn in the first decade of Scottish independence.
