Gender quotasMeanwhile, Labour MSP Kezia Dugdale has called for gender quotas to be guaranteed in the Scottish parliament.
"As politicians discuss 'extensive new powers' for the Scottish Parliament, we would like to see the power to legislate for gender quotas devolved.
"We want every political party to support gender quotas in their manifestos for the 2016 Holyrood elections.
The call for gender quotas has also been backed by SNP MSP Marco Biagi, Lib Dem MSP Alison McInnes, Labour MSP Jackie Baillie and independent MSP Jean Urquhart.
