The Scottish National Party surged to victory in 2011 during the last vote for the Scottish Parliament based on the promise of holding the coming referendum.
But the as-of-yet-unnamed pending addition to the Royal Family could be just the boon needed to help turn back the tide against a surge of support for Scottish independence.
Beating out even the Diamond Jubilee and London Olympics in terms of support, last yearâ€™s Royal Birth led to two-thirds of Britons supporting the monarchy.
The announcement of a new royal baby may not be enough to stanch the flow of support towards Scotland leaving the United Kingdom.
This would leave them, like Canada and other former British colonies, free to both enjoy a new royal and decide their own policies.
