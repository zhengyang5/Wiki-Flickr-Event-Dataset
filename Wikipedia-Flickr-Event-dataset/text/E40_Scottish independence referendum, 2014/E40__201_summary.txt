An independent Scotland could expect to become a member of the European Union within 18 months of a yes vote, according to a senior EU negotiator.
Graham Avery, the European Commission's honorary director general, said the UK government's position on Scotland in Europe was "perplexing" and "absurd".
Asked about these interventions, Mr Avery described what they had said as "not the whole truth".
Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, described the intervention as "an extremely significant and important contribution from an eminent and vastly-experienced European policy adviser".
"People can be reassured that an independent Scotland will remain a member of the European Union," he added.
