Posted on April 23, 2013Scottish Greens are accusing UK Chancellor George Osborne and SNP Finance Secretary John Swinney of waging a phoney war, with their suggestions that a Sterling zone is either impossible or inevitable.
Scottish Greens have not ruled out supporting a Sterling zone as a short term transitional arrangement, but have urged the Scottish Government to keep an open mind about moving towards an independent currency.
The Scottish Government’s currency paper, published today, endorses the idea of a Sterling zone but agrees the need for flexibility should circumstances change.
Patrick Harvie MSP, Co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said:“George Osborne is more interested in scaring people ahead of the referendum than an honest assessment of the options after it.
Scotland’s hand in those negotiations would be strengthened if we did the groundwork on our own currency so we keep it as a realistic medium-term option.
