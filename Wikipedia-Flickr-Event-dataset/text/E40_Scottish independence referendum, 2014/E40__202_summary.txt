The report, by the European Policy Centre think tank, also argued that the situation could cause "a legal nightmare" for other member states.
But the pro-Union Better Together campaign said Scotland could lose the UK's "special deals in the EU".
Mr Avery, who negotiated the UK's entry into the European Community in the 1970s, has previously spoken out in support of the Scottish government's aim of EU membership within 18 months, if Scots vote "Yes" to independence.
"Scotland outside the EU, and not applying EU rules, would be a legal nightmare for EU member states, whose citizens and enterprises would lose their rights in Scotland.
"No member state, particularly not the rest of the UK, would have an interest in creating such an anomaly."
