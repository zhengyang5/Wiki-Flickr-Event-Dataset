For a start we can observe that there is a strong correlation between income and wealth, and voting YES and NO.
In the early hours of Friday morning September 19, it was already clear that the income deprived areas were voting YES in large numbers.
In Glasgow, every single Scottish Parliament constituency (of which there are 8) returned a YES vote, particularly the big outlying working class housing schemes.
In Glasgow every constituency returned a majority YES vote, of different proportions, and overall the YES vote was 53.5% and NO achieved 46.5%.
In Edinburgh the YES vote was largely recorded in the main housing estates.
