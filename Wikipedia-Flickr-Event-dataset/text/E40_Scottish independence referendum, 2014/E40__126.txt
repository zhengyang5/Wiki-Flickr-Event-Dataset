A YES vote in the referendum later this year will end the “democratic failure” at the heart of UK politics, according to a leading figure in the independence camaign.

Scottish Socialist party co-spokesperson Colin Fox has warned Scotland’s prosperity is currently hampered in favour of the South East of England and urged supporters to “keep their eye on the prize.”

Mr Fox, a former Lothians MSP, is an advisory board member of the official Yes Scotland camapign.

He said today: “If Scotland votes Yes in September 300 years of British domination will come to an end as will the democratic failure at the heart of UK

politics.

“We are governed by those without a mandate to do so and are penalised by an economic model biased towards the South East of England that has failed us over decades.

“A Yes vote will change all that and signal our preparedness to build a new society that rejects the exploitative and iniquitous laissez-faire model in favour of harnessing the full potential of our nation and its resources for the benefit of every one.”

The radical left-winger said his message to Scots is “Come and change the world with us” when they cast their vote on September 18th.

He added: “My message to Yes supporters is borrowed from Martin Luther King who said at a juncture similar to this one ‘Keep your eyes on the prize’. For what a remarkable ‘prize’ independence will be for the people of Scotland.”
