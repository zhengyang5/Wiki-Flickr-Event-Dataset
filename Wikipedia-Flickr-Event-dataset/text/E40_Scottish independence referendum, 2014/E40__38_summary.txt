Image caption SNP leader Alex Salmond was the first to sign the declarationThe Yes Scotland campaign has signed up 143,000 backers during the six months since promising to get a million people to support its independence pledge.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said in May that if the one million target was achieved, independence would happen.
A spokesman for the Better Together group, which is campaigning to keep Scotland in the UK, insisted the majority of Scots did not support independence.
"If they want to sign up enough Scots to win a majority, they will still be chasing signatures in 2018.
'We shall win'Mr Salmond, along with the leader of the Scottish Greens, Patrick Harvie, publicly signed the declaration at the launch of the Yes Scotland campaign in Edinburgh earlier this year.
