Malcolm Bell, the convenor of Shetland Islands council, said the independence referendum offered an opportunity for the islands to carve out a new political settlement.
Scott, who first raised this argument in a paper last year, fears that whichever side wins the independence referendum, more powers will be centralised by the Scottish government in Edinburgh, 300 miles south of the islands' main town, Lerwick.
Scott said there had been a "remorseless pattern of centralisation" under Salmond's Scottish National party government.
These Gaelic-speaking islands are famous for hand-woven Harris tweed, their beaches, the Callanish standing stones and, on Lewis and north Harris, Sabbatarianism, the orthodox Protestant rule banning work and play on Sundays.
