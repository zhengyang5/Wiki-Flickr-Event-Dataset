That situation made the ramp-up of North Sea oil in the late 1970s all the more of a bonanza.
“Britain is a tragedy,” the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told President Ford in 1975, adding that the country had “sunk to begging, borrowing [and] stealing until North Sea oil comes in”.
The tax revenues from oil have proved to be a “real windfall,” he said.
“[There is] no question that the welfare bill that generated would not have been sustainable without North Sea oil revenues,” Anthony Barnett, founder of the website Open Democracy, told FRANCE 24.
Of late, Britain’s tax revenues from North Sea oil and gas have stuttered amid a wave of shutdowns, including by French oil major Total at the Elgin/Franklin field it operates there.
