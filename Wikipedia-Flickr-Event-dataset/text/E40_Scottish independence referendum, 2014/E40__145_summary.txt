There would be no "massive positive contribution" to the Sterling Zone's balance of payments following Scottish independence.
The Scottish Government and the 'Yes' campaign are fostering a myth about the size of the loss to the continuing UK, or rUK, balance of payments in the event of Scottish independence and withdrawal from sterling.
What the Scottish government has chosen to ignore are the offsetting flows that favour sterling and the rUK balance of payments in the event of Scottish independence.
Taken together, the net deterioration in the rUK balance of payments following Scottish independence with a separate currency is Â£3.4 billion.
There is little in this analysis to deny the contention of the Treasury paper that a formal sterling union following Scottish independence would "require rigorous oversight of Scotland's (fiscal) plans by continuing UK."
