The pro-Union Better Together campaign said using the pound in the way Panama used the dollar would be "a disaster".
Yes Scotland insisted that there would be a post-independence currency union.
A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: "People in Scotland can be assured that we will be using the pound after a 'Yes' vote and there will be a currency union.
"But after independence a currency union will be agreed because it's undeniably the best and most sensible option for the rest of the UK as well as of Scotland."
