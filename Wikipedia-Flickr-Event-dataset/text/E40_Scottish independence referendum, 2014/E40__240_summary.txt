It has also highlighted uncertainty over whether Scotland or the rest of the UK would pay some state pensions.
The Scottish government has set out its proposals for the future of pensions in the paper Pensions in an Independent Scotland and in its white paper on independence.
"From that point onwards, entitlement built up in Scotland will accrue to the Scottish state pension."
The campaign group added: "The Scottish government plans to establish a Scottish Pensions Regulator which would support a pan-UK approach to the regulation of private pensions and an integrated financial services market."
