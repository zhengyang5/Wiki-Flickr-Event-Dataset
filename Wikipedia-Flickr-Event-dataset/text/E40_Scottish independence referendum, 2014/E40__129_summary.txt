A potential oil boom off the west coast of Scotland was blocked by Westminster defence chiefs.
Ministers at the time said oil firms were “expecting something exploitable” following a series of geological surveys of the area.

A separate document from the Department for Energy states this original plan would have “undoubtedly been the subject of sustained objection from the MoD”.
He said: “We knew the blockage was down to the MoD so it is nice to be finally vindicated.
