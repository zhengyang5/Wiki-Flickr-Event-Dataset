Deputy First Minister and Scottish Labour leader will debate on Scotland Tonight on February 25.

The two most senior women in Scottish politics will go head-to-head in an STV debate on independence.

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont will face each other in a live Scotland Tonight special, the fourth such programme to be broadcast in the run up to September's referendum.

Ms Sturgeon and Ms Lamont will argue their constitutional cases in a debate to be aired on STV at 10.30pm on Tuesday, February 25.

Gordon Macmillan, head of news at STV, said: “With the independence referendum just over seven months away, STV will continue to bring viewers all the news, analysis and discussion in the lead-up to the big event.

“We aired three successful Scotland Tonight referendum specials in 2013 and as the debate intensifies over the coming months we will provide a platform for opinions from both sides of the debate.”

The programme will be hosted by Scotland Tonight’s two presenters, John MacKay and Rona Dougall. There will be live reaction from political analysts in the studio and viewers via Twitter and Facebook.

The debate will be streamed live on www.stv.tv/scotlandtonight and will be available on the STV Player. Viewers are encouraged to interact with #scotnight on @ScotlandTonight.
