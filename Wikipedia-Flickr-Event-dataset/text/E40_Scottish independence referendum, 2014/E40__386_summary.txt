A bid by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to quash the efforts of separatists by calling an election backfired in December.
But their determination to reinstate their controversial leader and pursue a split from Spain has brought the two sides to an impasse.
Following a symbolic referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election.
JxCat (Together for Catalonia) won the most votes among the separatist parties, and Mr Puigdemont is the only candidate to be Catalonia's president.
The EU has treated the crisis as an internal matter for Spain, deaf to the separatists' pleas for support.
