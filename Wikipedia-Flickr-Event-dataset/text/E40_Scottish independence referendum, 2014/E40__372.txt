Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation

The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) identifies small area concentrations of multiple deprivation across all of Scotland. It allows effective targeting of policies and funding where the aim is to wholly or partly tackle or take account of area concentrations of multiple deprivation.

SIMD 2012 contains 38 different indicators covering seven different dimensions of deprivation. These dimensions are: Income, Employment, Health, Education, Housing, Access to Services and Crime. These are combined to create the overall SIMD 2012.

Key Results

SIMD 2012 shows that multiple deprivation in Scotland has become less concentrated over time. In SIMD 2004, nearly half of all datazones in the most deprived 10% across Scotland were in Glasgow City. In SIMD 2012, this has dropped to just over a third of these datazones concentrated in Glasgow City.

The 15% most deprived datazones in Scotland are shared out among local authorities as shown in the ‘National Share’ chart below. The local authorities with the largest National Shares are:

Glasgow City (30%)

North Lanarkshire (10%)

Fife (6%)

Dundee City (6%)

Edinburgh City (6%)

Local authority areas differ in terms of what percentage of their datazones fall within the 15% most deprived datazones in Scotland, as shown in the ‘Local Shares’ chart below. The local authorities with the largest Local Shares are:

Glasgow City (42%)

Inverclyde (40%)

Dundee City (31%)

West Dunbartonshire (26%)

North Ayrshire (26%)

Glasgow has seen a fall in the proportion of its datazones in the 15% most deprived from 54% in SIMD 2004 to 48% in SIMD 2006, 44% in SIMD 2009 and 42% in SIMD 2012.

Eilean Siar, Moray, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands do not have any data zones in the 15% most deprived in SIMD 2012. This does not mean there is no deprivation in these areas, just that it is not concentrated in small areas.
