A petition demanding the Scottish independence referendum be re-held "because it was rigged" has garnered 70,000 signatures in less than 24 hours.
"We demand a re-vote be taken of said referendum, where each vote shall be counted by two individuals, one of whom should be an international impartial party without a stake in the vote."
Social media users spotted a clear 'Yes' ballot among the papers on a table allocated to 'No' votes.
Scottish nationalists were told to "get a grip" yesterday after pro-independence supporters venter their frustrations on social media after the result was announced.
They said it related to possible cases of impersonation, where people pretend to be someone else, cast the vote, then the real person turned up to vote.
