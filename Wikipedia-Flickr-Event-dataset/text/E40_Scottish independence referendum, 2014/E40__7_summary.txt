The Scottish Sun front page featured a hangman's noose in the shape of an SNP logo.
"Vote SNP today and you put Scotland's head in the noose," it cried.
Highly questionable assertions from Labour election leaflets were presented as if they were hard fact.
Scottish taxpayers would pay £5,000 per head, said the Sun; income tax would go up 3p; thousands of jobs would be lost.
The alleged hike in income tax refers to the SNP policy of replacing council tax with a local income tax, which actually involves a £400 million tax reduction.
