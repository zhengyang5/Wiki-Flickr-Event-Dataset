The SNP's policy is to hold a referendum on Euro membership Divisions within the SNP about joining the Euro have been laid bare at the party's annual conference.
Delegates in Inverness threw out calls to dump the SNP's commitment to a referendum on Euro membership.
Mr Smith urged conference to drop the commitment, saying the referendum qualification was "too conditional".
SNP national secretary Duncan Ross claimed the referendum proviso amounted to procrastination and "the politics of moral failure".
But SNP conference stalwart Gerry Fisher went further, declaring: "We don't want a referendum on the euro."
