An ultra-Nationalist fringe group that routinely burns the Union flag and refers to it as the "butcher's apron" has been banned from an independence rally at which First Minister Alex Salmond will speak.
The move to keep The Scottish Republican Socialist Movement (SRSM) away from next weekend's rally came after opposition politicians used its involvement to embarrass Salmond.
The First Minister was criticised for agreeing to speak at the cross-party "rally for independence" in Edinburgh, for which the SRSM was officially described as a participating group.
It accused Salmond of sharing a platform with "a group who regularly burn Union flags, attack the Queen, glorify terrorism and advocate a violent Scottish revolution."
The Imperialist Union flag is not called the 'butcher's apron' for nothing."
