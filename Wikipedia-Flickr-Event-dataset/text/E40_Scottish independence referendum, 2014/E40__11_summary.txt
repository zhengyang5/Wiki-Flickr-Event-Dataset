Scotland's main party leaders have refused to say how many public sector jobs may be cut in the coming years, as they faced each other in a TV debate.
The BBC Scotland debate came on the day economists warned there could be thousands of job losses ahead.

The debate also turned to an independence referendum, which the SNP dropped in the last parliament after failing to win enough support from other parties.
