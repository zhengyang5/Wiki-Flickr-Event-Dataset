In a briefing paper issued ahead of today’s competing estimates on the cost – or savings – of Scottish independence, the Treasury said that creating the new government departments required would “see Scottish taxpayers fork out £2.7 billion”.
Posting on his Twitter account, Prof Dunleavy wrote: “UK Treasury press release on #Scotland costs of government badly misrepresents LSE research.”He told the Financial Times: “The Treasury’s figures are bizarrely inaccurate.
I don’t see why the Scottish government couldn’t do this for a very small amount of money.”Research carried out by Prof Dunleavy in 2010 estimated that the cost of setting up a new Whitehall department was £15 million.
UK Treasury press release on #Scotland costs of government https://t.co/5prEDjJJsZ badly misrepresents LSE research http://t.co/41QX5H4bwa — Patrick Dunleavy (@PJDunleavy) May 27, 2014In coming up with its figure of £2.7 billion, the Treasury has simply multiplied Prof Dunleavy’s figure by 180 – the number of public bodies the Scottish government thinks it will need after independence.
He said that the Treasury overstated costs by around 12 times, estimating instead that the one-off set-up costs would be £150 to £200 million.
