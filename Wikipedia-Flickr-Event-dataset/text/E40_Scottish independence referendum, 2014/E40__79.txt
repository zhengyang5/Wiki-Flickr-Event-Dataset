Trident: Nowhere to Go, published in January 2012, is a detailed analysis of government archives. These documents discussed various possible locations for siting Polaris, Trident's predecessor. In light of recent developments toward a possible independence referendum in Scotland, this timely report analyses, using the MoD's own assessments, why alternative locations to Faslane and Coulport in Scotland are simply not tenable.

With locations including the 2012 Olympics sailing venue, National Trust land and densely populated residential areas, there is simply nowhere for Trident to go.

Trident: Nowhere to Go is a joint publication by CND and Scottish CND.
