Childcare plans in the independence White Paper would see families save up to Â£4,600 per child each year, First Minister Alex Salmond has told MSPs.
During a heated debate in Holyrood's main chamber, Mr Salmond said he was looking to bring more than 100,000 women into the workforce.
She said: "If it was 'transformational', if [Mr Salmond] believed it was that important, he would start now."
She said she had previously offered to work with Mr Salmond on a new childcare commission, adding: "I'll offer him that now.
Meanwhile, responding to the White Paper, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie called Mr Salmond "the patron saint of blind optimism".
