SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE: The Queen said she hopes voters in the independence referendum will “think very carefully about the future”, it was reported yesterday.
She made the comment after attending a church service near her Balmoral estate.
The Queen told a well-wisher: “Well, I hope people will think very carefully about the future.” Her comments will be seen as helpful to No campaigners.
“Like the people of Israel standing before Elijah, I need to come off the fence.
The real success of Thursday will be that, whatever the outcome, every voice will continue to play its part in shaping the kind of Scotland people in Scotland vote for.”SEE ALSO• Brian Monteith: Uncivilised descent into threats• Leaders: Response to IS must be carefully measured• Lesley Riddoch: Yes, this was road well travelled
