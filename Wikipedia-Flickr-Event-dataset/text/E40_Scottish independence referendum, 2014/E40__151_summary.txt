The Scottish government insisted it would keep sterling in a formal currency union, assuming independence.
Earlier this year, economist Prof John Kay said Scotland should be prepared to adopt an independent currency.
Scotland may not have much more influence on monetary policy in a currency union than if it just unilaterally adopted sterling, the authors suggested.
The Bank of England could impose checks and balances on Scottish fiscal policy, debt, deficit, taxation and public spending, which "could amount to a loss of fiscal autonomy" for Scotland.
