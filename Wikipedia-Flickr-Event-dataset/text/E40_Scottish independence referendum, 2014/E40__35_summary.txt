The Scottish independence referendum cost £2m more than expected to stage, at nearly £16m, after voter turnout hit record levels.
The Scottish government said the final administrative cost – for count officers, electoral returning officers, postage costs and the Electoral Commission – was £15.85m, equivalent to £4.38 per head for the 3.62 million people who took part.
Ministers had estimated in the referendum bill process that the administrative cost – which excludes the money spent by the rival Scottish and UK government campaigns – would be about £13.7m.
Prof John Curtice, an elections expert at Strathclyde University, said: “Democracy costs money.
But only 19 million people turned out for that referendum, just 41% of the total possible electorate and less than half the 86% turnout in the independence referendum.
