The campaign for Scottish independence has "virtually no chance" of victory, according to Nate Silver, the polling expert who accurately called the outcomes of the 2008 and 2012 US presidential elections.
In an interview with the Scotsman, Silver, who correctly predicted the results of all 50 states in 2012, said the Scottish data was "pretty definitive".
He said the New York Times is "in a business where they are not very good at monetising content.
He praised his former colleagues at the New York Times, saying: "My critiques of the Times are not about people in the newsroom.
He added that he still goes "to the New York Times every day and, increasingly, the Guardian â€“ which has better coverage of American politics".
