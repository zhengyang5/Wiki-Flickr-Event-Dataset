Scottish independence would cost businesses north of the Border 11 times as much as their competitors in England if both countries do not share a currency, according to an analysis published by Labour.
Johann Lamont, the party's Scottish leader, unveiled figures compiled by Holyrood officials showing having different currencies on either side of the Border would burden Scottish businesses with £400 million of transaction costs annually.
The First Minister yesterday said any such transaction costs would be their responsibility for refusing to agree to his proposal.
She said: “Transaction costs for the rest of the UK, the so-called George Tax, work out at £9 per head for people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
But Mr Salmond said: “Our proposal is to share the pound and not have the transaction costs.
