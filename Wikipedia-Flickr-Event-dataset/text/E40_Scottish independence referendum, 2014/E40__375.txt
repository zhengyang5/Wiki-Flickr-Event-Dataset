PM says he has made apologies and will probably be making more after comment about Queen’s reaction to Scotland vote

A mortified David Cameron has said he will apologise again to the Queen after he broke convention to tell the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that she “purred down the line” when he informed her that Scotland had voted against independence.

The prime minister told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 that he felt “extremely sorry and very embarrassed” after confirming an open secret that the Queen had wanted Scotland to remain in the UK.

The Queen, who had urged voters in Scotland to think “very carefully” before casting their votes in the referendum, had followed convention by declining to take sides in public.

But the prime minister highlighted her private thinking when a Sky News microphone last week picked him up recounting to Bloomberg a conversation with the Queen in the hours after the vote.

Cameron said of his conversation in New York: “One of those moments when you look back and kick yourself very hard. It was not a conversation I should have had, even though it was a private conversation.

“I am extremely sorry and very embarrassed about it. I have made my apologies and I think I will probably be making some more. I am very sorry about it.”

The PM had told Bloomberg: “The definition of relief is being the prime minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying: ‘It’s alright, it’s OK.’ That was something. She purred down the line.”
