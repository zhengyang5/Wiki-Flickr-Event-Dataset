UKIP leader Nigel Farage has challenged First Minister Alex Salmond to a televised debate ahead of the independence referendum.
He said he is the best placed of the pro-UK leaders to take on Mr Salmond over an independent Scotland’s place in Europe.
Mr Farage said: “The other pro-UK parties have dropped the ball on this because they all want us to stay in the EU as well.
Mr Farage said “euroscepticism is strong in Scotland”, although he admitted that it is “still not as high as it is in England and nowhere near what it is in Northern Ireland”.
A spokeswoman for the SNP, which is pressing for a televised debate between Mr Salmond and Prime Minister David Cameron, dismissed Mr Farage’s challenge, describing Ukip as “an irrelevance in Scotland”.
