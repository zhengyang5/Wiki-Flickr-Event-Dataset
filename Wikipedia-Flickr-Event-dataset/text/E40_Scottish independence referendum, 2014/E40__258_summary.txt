Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael has said that people in Shetland have the right to “start a conversation” on having more autonomy in event of a heavy Shetland no vote and a narrow Scottish yes win.
Mr Carmichael, echoing his comments quoted in a Guardian newspaper article claimed that the SNP had ruled out any such status for Shetland, quoting theWee Blue Book that has been handed out to independence campaigners.
The book apparently says that Shetland and Orkney are legally part of Scotland and no more entitled to their own referendum than other parts of Scotland.
Shetland and Orkney MP, Mr Carmichael said that it should be clear that he did not want such circumstances to arise – and the best way to avoid this was to vote no in the referendum.
It implied that only the nationalists were fighting Scotland’s corner while anyone else was on “team Westminster,” said Mr Carmichael.
