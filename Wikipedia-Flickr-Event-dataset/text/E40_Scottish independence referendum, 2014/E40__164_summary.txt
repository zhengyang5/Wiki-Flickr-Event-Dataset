On this basis, Scotland 'got' £16.5bn more in UK public spending in 2009-10 than it contributed to total UK revenues - or a 'subsidy' of around £3,150 per head.
Put it another way: Scotland provided 9.4% of total UK revenues and got 'only' 9.2% of UK public spending in return.
Now of course, the UK Treasury doesn't agree that the oil revenues belong to Scotland, and it almost certainly never will.
On the Treasury view, the gap between spending and revenues in Scotland for 2009-10 was £3,150 per head.
Namely, that Scotland is not the only part of the UK that is currently spending more than it raises in revenues.
