Image caption The referendum will take place on Thursday, 18 September, 2014The latest estimated cost of holding the Scottish independence referendum stands at £13.3m, a rise of about £3m on previous figures.
An impact assessment report to the Scottish Parliament said running the referendum itself would account for £8.6m of the total sum.
Scotland's voters go to the polls on 18 September next year when they will be asked to say yes or no to independence.
The last time the costs of the referendum were looked at was in the Scottish government's consultation paper Your Scotland - Your Referendum, published at the beginning of last year.
"The Scottish government has consulted extensively with electoral professionals to ensure this consistency and that the proposals are workable."
