More than half the Perth and Kinross pupils who took part in a special debate on Scottish independence said the country should remain part of the UK.
The Young Personâ€™s Question Time held at the North Inch Community Campus in Perth on Wednesday allowed S4-6 students from across the region to discuss questions arising from the Scottish referendum in 2014.
Hundreds of teenagers attended the event, which featured questions as diverse as whether the monarch would remain relevant in an independent Scotland, to what industries would support the independent economy.
By the end of the session, that had swung to 46% being in favour of independence, while just 4% remained on the fence.
The number opposing independence remained at 51%.
