© STVThe SNP has launched its election manifesto with a vow to bring forward an independence referendum during the next Parliamentary session.
Leader Alex Salmond said that the SNP would "give Scots an opportunity to decide our nation’s future".
adding that opposition parties would "have no choice" but to back a referendum if the SNP were re-elected to a second term.
There is no mention of a single police force in the manifesto, but it does include a proposal for a single fire service.
“The SNP will always put independence before the needs of the Scottish people."
