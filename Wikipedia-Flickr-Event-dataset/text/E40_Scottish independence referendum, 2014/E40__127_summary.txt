Independence ‘boost’ for English devolutionistsAn opinion poll of people in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland has found that many believe independence for Scotland would “boost support for a decentralisation of powers away from Westminster to the regions of England”.
But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the results showed a Yes vote in the September referendum “may well be a helpful and constructive influence in the developing constitutional debate south of the border”.
He told The Targe: “The Scottish referendum should be a catalyst for a debate on how devolution is implemented in England but instead we are faced by a wall of silence from the major political parties.
This is simply not good enough when it is evident that the supporters of all major parties support the idea of decentralisation towards the regions of England.”The cross-party Yorkshire Devolution Movement, which has already considered the impact of Scottish independence, campaigns for the establishment of a directly-elected regional assembly for Yorkshire.
Sturgeon finished her remarks: “In all eventualities, we look forward to an independent Scotland having a relationship of friendship and co-operation with all our neighbours in these islands, including our next-door neighbours in the North of England.”
