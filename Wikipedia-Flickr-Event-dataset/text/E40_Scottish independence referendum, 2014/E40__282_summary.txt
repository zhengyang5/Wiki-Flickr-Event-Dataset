Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has suggested parts of the welfare budget could be devolved to the Scottish Government - but immigration law could not be.
The pro-Union parties insist Scotland will get more powers even if there is a No vote in next year's independence referendum.
Mr Moore said welfare and employment were areas where the possibility of further devolution should be "debated".
"Areas around bits of the welfare agenda and the employability agenda should be up for debate."
And he admitted there was not a uniform sense of direction among - and even within - the pro-union parties on future devolution.
