The NUJ called on campaigners to rein in abuse, much of which it said was fuelled by anonymous attacks on social media against individuals.
The organisation also said there was a particular issue with intimidation of BBC journalists.
The comments from the NUJ, three days before the referendum, came the day after a large crowd of protesters gathered outside BBC Scotland's Glasgow HQ, claiming the corporation's coverage had been biased against independence.
The NUJ also said it had experienced a number of Labour MPs accusing BBC journalists of political bias against the pro-Union Better Together campaign.
Blair Jenkins, chief executive of the Yes Scotland campaign for independence, said of the BBC protest: "I don't think there was anything that happened here yesterday that caused anyone serious concern."
