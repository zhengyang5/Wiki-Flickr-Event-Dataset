Nick Robinson has compared protests against his coverage of the Scottish independence referendum to something out of Vladimir Putin's Russia.
The outgoing BBC political editor hit out at "intimidation and bullying" of journalists during an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book Festival to promote his latest book Election Diary.
Mr Robinson admitted the episode was "a source of regret" but said: "Alex Salmond was using me to change the subject.
Alex Salmond was using me as a symbol, a symbol of the wicked, metropolitan, Westminster classes sent from England, sent from London, in order to tell the Scots what they ought to do.
"We should not live with journalists who are intimidated, or bullied, or fearful in any way".
