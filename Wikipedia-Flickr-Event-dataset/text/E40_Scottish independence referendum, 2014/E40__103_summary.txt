From: greencomms@scottish.parliament.uk GREEN MSP MEDIA RELEASE For immediate release 25 January 2012 REFERENDUM SHOULD SPARK AN ERA OF RADICAL SCOTTISH DEMOCRACY The Scottish Green Party today welcomed the publication of the independence referendum consultation, and called for the coming months of civic debate to act as testbed for a more inclusive way of doing politics in Scotland.
Greens have a vision of a more radical democracy in Scotland, with far greater levels of discussion and decision making at community level.
â€œThe draft bill published today gives the Scottish Parliament a real chance to prove its ability to work constructively and design a referendum that is fair and decisive.
I welcome the move to accept the oversight of the Electoral Commission by the Scottish Government.
