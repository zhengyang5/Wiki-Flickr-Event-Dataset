Officers set up an incident room to examine “valuable” CCTV evidence as SNP councillors criticised them for not acting more quickly to contain the disorder that broke out just hours after the Scottish independence referendum result was announced.
Police Scotland said arrests were for disorder, breach of the peace and vandalism, after people were attacked or threatened by the 700-strong mob who set off flares in the city’s George Square, where peaceful Yes rallies were held during the referendum campaign.
Footage showed people being kicked to the ground, Nazi-style salutes and Saltire flags being grabbed from people’s hands.
Don’t think that because you were not arrested by last night that you will not be caught.
