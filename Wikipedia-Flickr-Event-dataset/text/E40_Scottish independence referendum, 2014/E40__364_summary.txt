More than 4m people have registered to vote in the referendum, and both sides expect turnout to be extremely high.
3am: Eleven council areas, representing nearly a third of the registered electorate, are expected to declare their results.
They are Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dumfries and Galloway, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, Falkirk, Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire.
More than 95 per cent of the votes are likely to have been counted at this stage.
With just over 4 per cent of the registered electorate, the result of the referendum could be determined by the count in the northern city.
