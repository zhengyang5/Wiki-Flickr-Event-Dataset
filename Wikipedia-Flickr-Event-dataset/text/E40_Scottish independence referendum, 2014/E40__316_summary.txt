The prime minister has written to Scotland's first minister rejecting his invitation for a head-to-head showdown.
Mr Cameron said the first minister should instead face Alistair Darling, head of the pro-Union campaign group Better Together.
Mr Salmond has responded by accusing the prime minister of being too afraid to face him in a live political debate.
It is not a debate between the prime minister of the UK and the first minister of Scotland.
