Scottish Parliament 12 May 1999 [THE TEMPORARY CLERK opened the meeting at 09:30] Col 1 The Temporary Clerk (Paul Grice): Welcome to this, the first meeting of the Scottish Parliament established under the Scotland Act 1998.
We are gathered on this day and at this time and place, in accordance with The Scottish Parliament (First Ordinary General Election and First Meeting) Order 1999.
It is no secret that, to members of the Scottish National party, this Parliament is not quite the fulfilment of our dream, but it is a Parliament we can build a dream on.
We have waited for our first Scottish Parliament for nearly 300 years-indeed, this is our first ever democratically elected Scottish Parliament-and the Parliament was supposed to herald a new era of open democracy, but our first vote is to be a secret one.
16:26 The Presiding Officer: The voting period in the first round of voting in the election of the second Deputy Presiding Officer is now open.
