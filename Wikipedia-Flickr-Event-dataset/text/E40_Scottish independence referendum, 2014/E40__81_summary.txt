The governing Scottish National Party has called for a vote on independence from the United Kingdom as soon as 2014.
"I think that the Americans are only just waking up to what Scottish independence might mean for the future of the U.K.'s nuclear deterrent," Walker said.
In its November 2009 white paper on secession, the Scottish government declared that an independent Scotland "would become a non-nuclear weapons state."
Walker, though, said an independent Scotland could come under heavy lobbying from the United Kingdom and the United States to strike some sort of deal on housing the deterrent.
The Scottish National Party, though, has signaled it would be unwilling to consider a compromise on the matter following a vote for independence (David Maddox, Scotsman, April 2).
