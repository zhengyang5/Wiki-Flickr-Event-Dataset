Former EU economics chief Olli Rehn said it would "simply not be possible" to combine a policy of sterlingisation with EU membership.
Mr Rehn gave his opinion in response to a letter from Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.
Mr Rehn stepped down earlier this year as European Commissioner for economic and monetary affairs and the euro.
"We've heard a whole range of arguments for what is and what isn't required for EU membership, and none of them have stood up to further examination.
"We require in terms of EU membership a conduct authority and we require financial institutions, but of course we would form these financial institutions as we've stated."
