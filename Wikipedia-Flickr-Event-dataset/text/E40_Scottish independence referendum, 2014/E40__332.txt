A Scottish council has apologised and begun an investigation for an offensive Tweet directed at Alistair Darling during Monday's TV referendum debate.

The post - "Alistair shut yer pus!!!" - appeared on East Renfrewshire's Twitter page at 21:25 on Monday.

This coincided with Better Together leader Mr Darling going head-to-head with Yes campaign leader Alex Salmond in the BBC live debate in Glasgow.

The council said steps had been taken to ensure it did not happen again.

A council spokeswoman said: "We would like to apologise for any offence caused by an inappropriate tweet during the referendum debate.

"This was an unacceptable use of the council's Twitter account.

"This would appear to be a genuine human error, which we are investigating, and measures are in place to make sure that this does not happen again."

The debate took place at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum from 20:30 to 22:00.

About 843,000 people watched the debate on BBC One Scotland.

Mr Salmond and Mr Darling made their pitch to voters before an audience of 200 in Glasgow.

A snap poll by The Guardian newspaper and polling company ICM suggested 71% of those polled thought Mr Salmond had come out on top in the debate, against 29% for Mr Darling.

A similar poll of 500 Scottish voters, following their first clash on 5 August on STV, suggested the Better Together leader won that debate with the first minister by 56% to 44%.
