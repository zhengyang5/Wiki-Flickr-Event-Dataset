It is widely taken for granted that most Scots, unlike many English, are happy with being in the EU.
But long before then Scotland will hold its own referendum, in September 2014, to decide whether to stay in the UK.

Until now, the working assumption has been that an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK would both remain in the EU.
