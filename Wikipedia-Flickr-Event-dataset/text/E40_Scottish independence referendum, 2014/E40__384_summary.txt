Unlike London, which allowed the Scottish vote, Madrid says even a non-binding referendum would violate the Spanish constitution and has pledged to block it in the courts.
Catalan leader Arturo Mas denied that the Scottish rejection of independence had hurt the Catalan secessionist cause.
“What happened in Scotland is not a setback for us, because what we really want in Catalonia is to have the chance to vote,” Mas said.
A late surge in polls for Scottish independence had galvanized supporters of secession for Catalonia, and many expressed disappointment that Scots had ultimately held back.
Nevertheless, others seized on the enthusiastic Scottish vote as proof that whatever the outcome, regions should be permitted to choose their own future.
