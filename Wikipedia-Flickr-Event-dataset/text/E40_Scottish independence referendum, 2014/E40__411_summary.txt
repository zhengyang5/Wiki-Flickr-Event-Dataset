During the referendum campaign, the parties signed a pledge to devolve more powers to Scotland, if Scots rejected independence.
The Liberal Democrats propose giving Scotland power over income tax, inheritance and capital gains tax.
The party has also touted scrapping the Act of Union between Scotland and England and replacing it with a declaration of federalism.
In the immediate future, it's back to government - the job to which the SNP was elected by a landslide at the last Scottish Parliament election.
The other issue for Wales is the continuation of the Barnett funding formula, which sees Scotland get more spending per head than the UK average.
