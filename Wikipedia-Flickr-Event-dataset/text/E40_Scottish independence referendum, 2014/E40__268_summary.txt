Image caption Students in Scotland do not pay university feesScots students could be squeezed out of their home universities if there is a yes to independence and free tuition continues, experts have suggested.
Currently, Scots and EU students pay no tuition fees at Scottish universities, while UK students pay annual fees.
In an independent Scotland rest of the UK students would be reclassified as EU students and free tuition would apply.
For example, EU students pay an annual student contribution charge of €2,500.
Currently, universities in England and Wales are allowed to charge up to £9,000 a year and in Northern Ireland, students pay £3,575.
