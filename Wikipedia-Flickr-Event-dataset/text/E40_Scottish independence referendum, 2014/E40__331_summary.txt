Mr Darling insisted the momentum was with his campaign.
The two men took part in a BBC debate before an audience of 200 in Glasgow on Monday night.
A snap poll by The Guardian newspaper and polling company ICM suggested 71% of those polled thought Mr Salmond had come out on top in the debate, against 29% for Mr Darling.
Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Salmond said that TV debates were "not the be-all and end-all".
However, Mr Darling insisted the independence referendum debate would be a "fight right down to the wire".
