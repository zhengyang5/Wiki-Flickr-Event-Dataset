Allegations of electoral fraud at polling stations in Glasgow cast a shadow over the Scottish referendum result today.
Police launched an investigation after the cityâ€™s council alerted them to 10 suspected cases of voters impersonating other people, allowing them to complete two ballot papers.
Under British law, voters are not required to present identification when they take part in an election.
Martin said that he'd lived in Scotland for years and would be remaining north of border regardless of the outcome tonight.
The scale of the fraud appears to be very small, as the number of people registered to vote in Glasgow is 486,219.
