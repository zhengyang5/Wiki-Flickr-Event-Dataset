Mr Balls travelled to Dunfermline to campaign for Labour in the forthcoming by-election on the same day that the First Minister visited the town to do likewise for the SNP.
At the Lloyds Banking Group premises on the Pitreavie Business Park, Mr Balls was asked about Mr Salmond’s plans to keep the pound after ­independence.
There is no financial institution without a proper regulator and lender of last backing,” Mr Balls added.
Mr Salmond claimed that Mr Balls’s position differed from that outlined by Better Together leader Alistair Darling.
Despite his criticisms, Mr Salmond said the Scottish Government’s energy commission under the lawyer Robert Armour would examine the policy nonetheless.
