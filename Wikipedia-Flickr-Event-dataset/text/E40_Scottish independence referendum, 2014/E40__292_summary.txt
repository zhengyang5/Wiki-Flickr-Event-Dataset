Bob Geldof made an emotional plea to voters in Scotland not to break up the "family" at a London rally hoping to convince the country to stay in the UK.
But the United Kingdom is one of the greatest ideas for the modern age.
Speaking to the Guardian, Snow disputed that holding the rally in London sent a negative message up to Scottish voters.
What we want to do is for the rest of the United Kingdom to gather together and say please, when you are voting, remember one thing.
You are part of the United Kingdom family and we'd love you to stay."
