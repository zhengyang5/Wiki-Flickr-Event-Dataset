SINGER songwriter Billy Bragg has backed Scottish independence.
Following David Cameron’s impassioned support of the Union on Friday, Bragg tweeted: “Alex Salmond is right ‘Cameron doesn’t speak for England, he speaks for a Westminster elite’ Go for it, Scotland #Indy”.
He also posted on his Facebook page: “I’m in favour of Scottish independence because I believe that it is ultimately about accountability, as is socialism.
Bragg supports Scottish independence and Welsh independence.
Billy – like a growing number of people in the countries and regions of these islands – is supportive of Scottish independence and what it will mean for the people of England.
