The Scottish government has insisted current energy market arrangements would continue following a "Yes" vote.
It concluded that "a single energy market in Great Britain would be the most likely outcome in the event of a Yes vote".
The Scottish government's White Paper on independence states "a single GB-wide market for electricity and gas will continue with the current market trading arrangements".
Mr Ewing welcomed SSE's intervention, saying a single UK energy market was "in everyone's interests".
