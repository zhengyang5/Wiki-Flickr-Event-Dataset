SCOTS have been warned a substantial increase in financial powers for Holyrood is not an option if Scotland wants to remain within the United Kingdom.
The sources said a unified tax and benefits system across the UK, was at the “heart” of a single country, and could not be devolved to Scotland.
The warning – which appears to rule out both devo-max and other forms of fiscal autonomy – represents a high-stakes gamble for Cameron, with polls suggesting voters in Scotland support an option to give Holyrood more powers.
The campaign also includes the National Union of Students, the Institute of Directors, and think-tanks Reform Scotland, and the Scottish Centre for Public Policy.
The current Scotland Bill will devolve £12 billion of tax and borrowing powers and allow Holyrood control of a third of its budget.
