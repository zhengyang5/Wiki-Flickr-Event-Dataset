A man has been arrested in connection with an attempt to sell a referendum ballot paper on the online auction site eBay.

Police Scotland said a 28-year-old man was arrested in the Drumchapel area of Glasgow.

He has been reported to the procurator fiscal in relation to an alleged contravention of Schedule 7 of the Scottish Independence Referendum Act.

The Electoral Commission said the selling and buying of votes is illegal.

A spokeswoman said it could lead to a year in prison or a "substantial" fine.

She said the commission had made an agreement with eBay that any such "votes for sale" listings would be taken down and referred to police.

Police launched an investigation after a number of people apparently tried to sell their votes online.

Votes for the 18 September ballot were listed on the site, which has since removed the items.

One online listing offered buyers a "unique piece of British history".
