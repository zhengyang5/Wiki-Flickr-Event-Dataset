Thales, one of Britain's largest defence suppliers, has warned voters that opting for independence could lead to major job cuts and a slash in investment.
Both Britain's defence sector, which is currently worth £22bn (€27bn, $37bn), and its aerospace sector, which employs 230,000 people, base a large portion of their key operations in Scotland.
The YouGov poll released on 7 September showed that support for Scottish independence took the lead for the first time since the referendum was announced.
Thales is Britain's second-largest defence contractor, with 7,500 workers in total, employ around 500 people at Govan, Glasgow, which makes submarine periscopes for the Royal Navy.
"If Scotland became independent, we would no longer have that certainty and stability," said King in the blog.
