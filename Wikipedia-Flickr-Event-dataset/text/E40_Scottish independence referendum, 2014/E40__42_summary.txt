JK Rowling has been subjected to obscene online abuse after becoming the pro-UK campaign's biggest donor by giving £1 million.
One Edinburgh-based charity is being investigated by regulators after calling Rowling a "b****" in a message sent from its official Twitter account.
Her donation represented a significant boost for Better Together, which was concerned about being outspent by the opposing pro-separation Yes Scotland campaign.
It emerged last month that Yes Scotland is almost entirely bankrolled by an SNP-supporting couple who won the Euromillions lottery.
Their contributions meant Yes Scotland had raised nearly £4.9 million compared to the £2.8 million declared by Better Together in December.
