The SNP leader warned that businesses across the remainder of the UK would face transaction costs of “hundreds of millions of pounds” if Scotland is forced to use a different currency.
The Scottish Government estimates these costs – dubbed by Mr Salmond the “George tax” – could run to £500m.
His fightback speech also followed a prediction by European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso that it would be “extremely difficult, if not impossible” for an independent Scotland to win approval from member states for it to join the EU.
Detailed analysis and independent advice shows clearly that what is best for Scotland is keeping the stable and durable currency union we have now.
Most worrying is the UK Government’s threat to Welsh business by saying it will refuse a shared currency.
