A year ago YouGov's polls put the SNP on 23 per cent and Labour on 41.
They put the SNP on 42 per cent, Labour on 25, the Tories on 18, Lib Dems on 6, and Ukip and the Greens on 5 and 3.
But if the SNP do manage to win as many as 30 Scottish seats, and take 25 or so from Labour, it could prove decisive in May.
These numbers, of 30 or 40 SNP seats, are far beyond the bookiesâ€™ current odds: they are predicting the SNP will win 11-12 seats.
And some poll-watchers have pointed to how few seats the SNP threatened to win in 2010.
