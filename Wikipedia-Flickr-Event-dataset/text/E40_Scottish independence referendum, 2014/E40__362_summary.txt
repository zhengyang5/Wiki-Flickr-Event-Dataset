This is the “eve of the most exciting day in Scottish democracy,” Salmond told his campaign’s final rally last night in Perth, central Scotland.
The Yes Scotland and Better Together campaigns have both said they need to persuade Labour voters to back them if they are to win.
Groups with their own aspirations for independence across Europe are drawing on Scotland to push for similar votes, particularly in Catalonia.
Police said they were on standby for any tension today, while the Church of Scotland appealed for unity as people cast their votes.
Salmond, in a letter to voters published yesterday, said people should dismiss the “increasingly desperate” scare stories over independence.
