Social peace had been bought by tax cuts and welfare benefits, and these had been largely enabled by government income from North Sea oil that by the mid-1980s was delivering the Treasury 10% of its revenues.
Economic journalists such as the Observer's Bill Keegan keenly promoted the argument, and in 1987 even Tony Blair felt able to say that North Sea oil was "utterly essential to Mrs Thatcher's electoral success".
And yet the benefits of North Sea oil were never popularly acclaimed, or indeed much noticed.
No roofs were fixed: in this respect, Mrs Thatcher as the prudent housewife is a piece of make-believe.
Neither Big Oil nor the Big Bang has saved us â€“ what will, O Lord, what will?
