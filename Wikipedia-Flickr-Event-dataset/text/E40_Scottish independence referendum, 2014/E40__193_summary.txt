Jos√© Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, has thrown fresh doubt on claims by Alex Salmond that an independent Scotland would automatically remain within the EU.
"Yes, there will have to be negotiations, the negotiations will take place from within the context of the European union.
There is little doubt an independent Scotland would join the EU, but this intervention suggests there may be a delay.
"There are two different steps, there is a secession process under international law and the request for accession to EU member state under the EU treaties," Bailly said.
It was not the commission's role to speculate about the internal affairs of member states, he said.
