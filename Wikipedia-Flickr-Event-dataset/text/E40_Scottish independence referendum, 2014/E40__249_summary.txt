ISLANDERS could be asked to vote in a second referendum in September should a Scottish parliament petition launched by a new campaign group be successful.
The Referenda On The Islands group (ROTI) wants local people to vote on the constitutional future of their individual island group one week after the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September.
Do you wish the island group become an independent country?
Do you wish the island group stay in Scotland?
Do you wish the island group to leave Scotland and stay in the remainder of the UK?
