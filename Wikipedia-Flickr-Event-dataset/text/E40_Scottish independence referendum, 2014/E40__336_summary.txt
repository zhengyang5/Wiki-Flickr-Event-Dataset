The taxpayer-funded British Broadcasting Corporation has been accused of exhibiting bias against Scottish independence in an academic report published by Dr John Robertson of the University of the West of Scotland.
The BBC has not commented on the story or run it and neither has STV.
Whilst newspapers may print or fail to print what they see fit, the BBC is meant to be covered by more stringent rules than this.
Derek Bateman, a former BBC presenter and broadcast journalist stated that:â€œThe print media normally devour anything to do with the BBC and are besotted with it.
When a year-long independent study by a respected academic source and institution accuses the supposedly impartial BBC of bias in the Independence debate then it must by any definition be newsworthy.
