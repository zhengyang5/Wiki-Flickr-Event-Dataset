The electionforecast site is a joint project by experts at UEA, LSE and Durham, which uses a partial mean-reversion from current polling to forecast vote shares at the next election.
If we assume a pattern of turnout similar to 2010, we can derive forecast vote shares from their seat-level vote projections.
I’ll revist this analysis from time-to-time – one thing we can look forward to is some real Scottish polling from Lord Ashcroft.
I’ll provide updates to this analysis periodically, whether or not any dedicated Scottish polling is done.
Number Cruncher would like to thank Chris Hanretty of UEA for kindly providing helpful information on the electionforecast model.
