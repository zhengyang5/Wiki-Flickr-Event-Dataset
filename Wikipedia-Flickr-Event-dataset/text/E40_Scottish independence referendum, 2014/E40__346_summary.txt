A former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association has complained of intimidation from senior SNP members and claimed other business leaders have suffered such pressure during the referendum campaign.
Gavin Hewitt said challenges to the Scottish Government's views on independence were regrettably rebuffed too often by dismissal of the messenger.
"Sometimes it goes as far as intimidating calls from senior SNP members," he said.
Mr Hewitt said intimidation by the SNP had been "prevalent" but business people were not Â­willing to talk about it, adding: "The message was - get out of this debate."
He said the emails from SNP special advisor Campbell Gunn about carer Clare Lally "amount to that sort of thing."
