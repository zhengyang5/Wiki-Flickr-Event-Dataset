Democracy – British styleThe term Democratic Deficit used to be taken as indicating Scotland’s inability to get the government it voted for, specifically in 1979 and throughout the ’80s.
But Democratic Deficit says much more than this.
It is this unreachable constitution and its celebration as progress that might define Democratic Deficit.
This wider definition of Democratic Deficit is needed not simply pragmatically to get England on side, but because 2014 brings up ethical questions which we will not want to ignore.
The United Kingdom is the Democratic Deficit: we are all bound by it, and we will all have to leave it.
