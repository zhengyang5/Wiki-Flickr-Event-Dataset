Athletes in Scotland will find it harder to establish themselves as part of a national Olympics team in the event of independence because they would no longer be able to use facilities elsewhere, according to Sir Chris Hoy.
Sir Chris said he has decided what he will be voting for but refused to be drawn on the independence debate.
Most of the athletes have had to move to facilities which are often out-with Scotland.
"In Scotland we have the Institute of Sport and SportScotland there to try and give support to the athletes.
It will weaken the British team obviously if Scotland went separately, and it would be harder for the Scottish athletes initially to establish themselves in a new training environment, with new coaches, with a different environment altogether.
