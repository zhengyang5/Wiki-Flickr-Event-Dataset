I am a member of the Labour Party, which is against Scottish independence, but I will be voting Yes in September.

But the first government of an independent Scotland will be the government that wins the first election in an independent Scotland in May 2016.
Alex Salmond is the leader of the Scottish National Party and the First Minister of Scotland
