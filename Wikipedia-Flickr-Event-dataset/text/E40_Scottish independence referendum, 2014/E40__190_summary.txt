Image caption The Scottish government believes an independent Scotland would remain in the EUThe UK government has said it would not ask the European Commission's view on whether an independent Scotland would remain a member of the EU.
Previously the EC's position was that Scottish independence was a UK matter and not one it could speculate on.
A spokesman for the UK government said: "The UK government does not obtain its legal advice from the European Commission.
The question of whether an independent Scotland would automatically retain EU membership has been at the heart of the constitutional debate in recent weeks.
The Scottish government has maintained throughout the debate that if the country voted for independence it would automatically remain a member of the EU.
