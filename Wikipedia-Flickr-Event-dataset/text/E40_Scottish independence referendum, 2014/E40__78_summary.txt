Alex Salmond's plan to scrap Trident after Scottish independence would put the UK's nuclear deterrent "in jeopardy", more than a dozen of Britain's most senior defence veterans have warned.
Removing Trident nuclear weapons from Scotland after a Yes vote would endanger thousands of jobs and cast a "dark shadow" over relations with allies, the former army and defence chiefs warned.
"They would also view with alarm the White Paper suggestion of a constitutional ban on nuclear weapons in Scotland – a move which would be unacceptable for Nato allies."
"The negotiations with Westminster following a ‘Yes” vote, covering such vital matters as currency, financial settlements and re-allocating existing UK defence and other assets, can be expected to be complex and difficult.
If the very future of the UK nuclear deterrent was also in the balance, it would inevitably sour those negotiations."
