Yes Scotland set itself the target of getting a million signatures to its Yes Declaration when it launched in 2012.
First Minister Alex Salmond said at the time that if the target was met, Scotland would become independent.
The chief executive of Yes Scotland, Blair Jenkins, said breaking the one million barrier at this stage was a "clear indication" that the pro-independence campaign was on "a winning trajectory".
"More and more people are waking up to the fantastic opportunities created by a Yes vote.
Yes Scotland said that the precise number of signatories was 1,001,186 at 16:00 on Thursday.
