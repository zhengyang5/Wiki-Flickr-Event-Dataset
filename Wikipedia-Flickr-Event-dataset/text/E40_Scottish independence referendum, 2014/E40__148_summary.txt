Mr Salmond said forcing Scotland to use an alternative currency would cost businesses south of the border "many hundreds of millions of pounds".
He branded that the "George Tax" after UK Chancellor George Osborne, who last week ruled out a currency union.
Mr Salmond said Mr Osborne had misrepresented the impact a currency union would have on the rest of the UK.
But today Mr Salmond said EU law "would require all parties to negotiate in good faith and a spirit of co-operation".
Mr Salmond will be in Portlethen when the Prime Minister visits nearby Dyce, offering a handy opportunity for the two to hold a head-to-head public debate, according to Mr Salmond.
