Former chancellor says voters in rest of UK could block currency union with Scotland if it voted for independenceAlex Salmond's plans to form a new currency union with the rest of the UK after an independence referendum could be blocked by voters in the rest of Britain, Alistair Darling has warned.
He said it was "surreal" that the Scottish government had not yet asked whether voters or MPs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland would agree to a sterling currency union after the referendum.
"It's the settled view amongst all the political parties at Westminster that if anything changes in our currency, people will be asked," Darling said.
As England's closest trading partner, currency union would benefit both countries, he said.
A currency union would require agreements on interest rates, debt levels, borrowing limits, taxation rates and tax regimes between both countries, in effect tying the hands of an independent Scotland.
