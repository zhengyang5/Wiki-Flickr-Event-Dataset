Carwyn Jones, the first minister of Wales, has warned that the Welsh government would probably try to block plans by Alex Salmond for a new sterling currency union if Scotland voted for independence.
"I would be uncomfortable being part of a currency union where there are competing governments trying to run it.
The UK and Scottish governments would have competing economic and financial interests, but would have to agree strict fiscal rules for a currency union to work and slow down decision-making.
The Welsh first minister said he opposed independence, arguing that Scotland would be better protected by the pooled resources and shared interests of the UK, while the UK itself would be stronger.
As part of the UK, Scotland shared in the truest and most efficient common market in the world, he said.
