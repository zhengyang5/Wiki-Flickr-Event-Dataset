Local government minister Derek Mackay promised an Islands Act following independence.
THE SCOTTISH islands are to have their own act of parliament if Scotland votes for independence in next year’s referendum.
On Thursday the Scottish government pledged to bring forward a bill for an Islands Act at the third meeting of its island areas ministerial working group.
However the island councils say there should be legislation to devolve power to the islands regardless of the referendum’s outcome.
“The best prospect of implementing the outcome of the groups discussion is with the full powers of independence, and in that event we propose to bring forward a bill for an Islands Act.”Speaking on behalf of the three council leaders, Orkney Islands Council convener Steven Heddle said an Islands Act should not depend on Scotland voting for independence.
