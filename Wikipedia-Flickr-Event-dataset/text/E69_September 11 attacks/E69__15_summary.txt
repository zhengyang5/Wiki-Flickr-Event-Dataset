Mr. Obama said Pakistan had helped develop the intelligence that led to Bin Laden, but an American official said the Pakistani government was not informed about the strike in advance.
The city of Abbottabad where Bin Laden was found has had other known Al Qaeda presence in the past.
Even so, SITE said, sympathizers on the forum posted messages calling Bin Laden a martyr and suggesting retaliation.
“As we have stated repeatedly since the 9/11 terror attacks, Bin Laden never represented Muslims or Islam,” the group said in a statement.
“Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims,” Mr. Obama said.
