The death of Mr. Bin Laden is a defining moment in the American-led war on terrorism.
President Obama said that on Sunday, a small team of U.S. operatives launched a “targeted assault’’ on a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where months of intelligence work had established that Mr. Bin Laden was living.
Mr. Bin Laden was killed after a firefight, and the troops took custody of his body.
The killing ended a 10-year manhunt in which Mr. Bin Laden repeatedly eluded his pursuers, deeply frustrating the Bush administration and counterterrorism officials.
Mr. bin Laden was able to elude capture by hiding out in the mountains of Afghanistan and elsewhere.
