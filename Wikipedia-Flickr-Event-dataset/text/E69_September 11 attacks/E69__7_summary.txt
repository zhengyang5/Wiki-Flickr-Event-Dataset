Image caption Bin Laden was top of the US "most wanted" listA Pakistani commission investigating the US raid that killed Osama Bin Laden has said the government should not allow his family to leave the country.
Three of Bin Laden's wives and several children were detained after the 2 May raid on a compound near Islamabad.
The commission is investigating how the al-Qaeda leader hid in the Abbottabad compound for nearly five years.
Bin Laden, 54, orchestrated the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington in which nearly 3,000 people died.
The commission, headed by a senior judge of the Supreme Court, has ordered the interior ministry and the main intelligence agency, the ISI, to make sure that Bin Laden's family does not leave the country without its permission.
