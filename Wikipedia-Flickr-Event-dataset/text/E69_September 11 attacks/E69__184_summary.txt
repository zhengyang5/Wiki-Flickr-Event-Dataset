Post-9/11 assessment sees major security gapsAmong the issues, warn the former heads of the panel, is the unreliability of the system to keep airline passengers from smuggling explosives onto a plane.

Kean said it was "outrageous" that Congress had not passed a law to allocate new radio spectrum to first responders.
In February, President Obama called for $7 billion to build an emergency broadband network using a designated band of radio spectrum known as D-block.
"This is a rare circumstance where I think the 9/11 Commission is wrong," Baker said.
