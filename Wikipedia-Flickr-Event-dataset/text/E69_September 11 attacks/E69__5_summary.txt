Al-Qaeda's leaders: (From left) Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama Bin Laden and Mohammed AtefAl-Qaeda, meaning "the base", was created in 1989 as Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan and Osama Bin Laden and his colleagues began looking for new jihads.
During the anti-Soviet jihad Bin Laden and his fighters received American and Saudi funding.
Some analysts believe Bin Laden himself had security training from the CIA.
After 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to Afghanistan, where Bin Laden forged a close relationship with the Taleban.
Most frustratingly, the fate and whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden himself is still a deep mystery.
