PressRelease(2001)124 12 September2001Statement by the North Atlantic Council On September 12th, the North Atlantic Council met again in response to the appalling attacks perpetrated yesterday against the United States.
The commitment to collective self-defence embodied in the Washington Treaty was first entered into in circumstances very different from those that exist now, but it remains no less valid and no less essential today, in a world subject to the scourge of international terrorism.
But they also recognised the existence of a wide variety of risks to security, some of them quite unlike those that had called NATO into existence.
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty stipulates that in the event of attacks falling within its purview, each Ally will assist the Party that has been attacked by taking such action as it deems necessary.
Accordingly, the United States' NATO Allies stand ready to provide the assistance that may be required as a consequence of these acts of barbarism.
