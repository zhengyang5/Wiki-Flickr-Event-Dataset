(Updates with specific charges in third paragraph.)

April 4 (Bloomberg) -- A Manhattan federal judge ordered the unsealing and dismissal of criminal charges against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S., as the government announced he will instead face a military tribunal.

The 80-page indictment, which names the almost 3,000 people killed in the attacks, charges Mohammed and four others with conceiving and helping execute the plan to hijack airliners and crash them into U.S. buildings “causing maximum casualties and destruction.”

The indictment charges Mohammed, Walid Bin Attash, Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Al-Hawsawi with nine criminal counts including conspiracy, acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, violence on and destruction of aircraft, aircraft piracy, murder of U.S. officers and employees, destruction of the World trade Center and conspiracy to kill Americans.

The unsealing of the indictment by U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy today makes public for the first time that Mohammed and the others were indicted Dec. 14, 2009, for the attacks. The case is being referred to the military justice system, Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement in Washington today.

Mohammed was previously named in an indictment filed against his nephew for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing case. The nephew, Ramzi Yousef, was convicted at a trial of orchestrating the first World Trade Center bombing. Mohammed was charged with being a co-conspirator in the earlier attack.

The case is U.S. v. Mohammed, 93-cr-180, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
