What are the goals of NIST's investigation of the World Trade Center disaster?
When the NCST Act was passed in October of that year, the WTC investigation was moved under its authorities.
Will the results of the investigation lead to reforms in building and fire safety codes, standards, and practices?
Besides the WTC investigation, NIST has conducted one other study under the authorities of the NCST Act, an investigation of the Feb. 20, 2003, fire at The Station nightclub in West Warwick, R.I.
Has NIST responded to those who believe that the WTC towers collapsed in ways other than the mechanisms determined by the NIST investigation?
