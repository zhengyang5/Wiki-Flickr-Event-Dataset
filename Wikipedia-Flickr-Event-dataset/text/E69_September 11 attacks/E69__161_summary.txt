Anticipatory fear has two distinct modes: anxiety, a preoccupation with an impending threat, and worry, the internal struggle to find a way to escape the danger.
It is probably safe to say that most of the fear experienced since September 11 has been worry and anxiety.
Sometimes, though, a person may develop anxiety or worry about potential catastrophes to an extent far beyond the normal fear response.
This sort of exaggerated worry is known as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
Instead, seeing friends experience a tragedy or even receiving mistaken information about potential risks is enough to trigger exaggerated anxiety.
