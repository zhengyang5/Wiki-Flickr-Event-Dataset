Policies adopted by the US government after 9/11 attacks have created an atmosphere of fear for South Asians, members of the communities have said as the nation prepares to observe the 10th anniversary of the terrorist strike of the twin towers in New York.
"While some of the extreme violence against South Asians, Arabs, Muslims, and Sikhs occurred immediately after 9/11, we come together here to share the way that post-9/11 policies have created an atmosphere of fear for many community members," said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of South Asian Network at a hearing in Artesia, California, over the weekend.
"I could not walk back into that store for a year and even now, ten years later, I still have trouble sleeping at night," he added.
Speaking on the occasion, Congresswoman Judy Chu stressed on the need to continue to speak out about the discrimination faced by South Asian Americans and other Americans since 9/11.
