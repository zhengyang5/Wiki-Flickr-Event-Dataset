Many minority groups were victims of hate crimes after 9-11(9/10/2003)People perceived to be Middle Eastern were as likely to be victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, says a Ball State University study.
Data collected from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program also found the number of such hate crimes fell dramatically after eight days, said Bryan Byers, a criminal justice professor and hate crimes researcher.
The FBI data suggests a 1,600-percent surge in anti-Islamic hate crimes in the days following the Sept. 11 attacks.
"We knew that followers of the Islamic faith were victims of hate crimes, but other groups suffered just as badly," Byers said.
The previous terrorist attacks may not have sparked hate crimes because each was smaller in magnitude, he said.
