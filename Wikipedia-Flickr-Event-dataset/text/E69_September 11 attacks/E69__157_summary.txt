Did Osama bin Laden win?
So why, when I called Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a counterterrorism expert who specializes in al-Qaeda, did he tell me that “bin Laden has been enormously successful”?
Bin Laden, according to Gartenstein-Ross, had a strategy that we never bothered to understand, and thus that we never bothered to defend against.
But it isn’t quite right to say bin Laden cost us all that money.
Bin Laden didn’t — couldn’t — bankrupt us.
