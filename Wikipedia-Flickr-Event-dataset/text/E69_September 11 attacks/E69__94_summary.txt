AbstractContext An understanding of characteristics of blood donors donating in times of crisis may help predict blood supply safety and donor return patterns.
Setting and Participants A total of 327 065 volunteer blood donors making 373 628 allogeneic donations at 5 large regional US blood centers.
We observed a marked increase in the proportion of first-time donors (Figure 2) giving blood on and after September 11, 2001.
We observed that the 12-month return rate of postâ€“September 11 first-time donors was similar to historical return rates.
The Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability has recognized this need and has recommended that the Department of Health and Human Services identify blood donors as a critical national resource and promote blood donations as a national service.28It is also important to assess the impact of a large influx of first-time donors on blood safety.
