On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, former Iranian President Mohammed Khatami condemned Osama bin Laden and suicide bombing but also defended groups such as Hizbullah for what he characterized as resistance against Israeli colonialism.
Responding to a question from the audience about bin Laden, Khatami said he had two problems with the al Qaeda leader behind the attacks.
His visit to the United States has been criticized by many, particularly amid concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
Harvard has been criticized for the timing of its invitation to Khatami, who is taking a two-week tour of the United States.
He was invited to the United States by the UN-sponsored Alliance of Civilizations, of which he is a founding member.
