Reveling in the details of the fatal attacks, bin Laden brags in Arabic that he knew about them beforehand and says the destruction went beyond his hopes.
The Bush administration hopes the tape will convince skeptics, particularly in the Muslim and Arab worlds, of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks.
Even as he showers compliments on bin Laden, one man apologizes for even speaking in bin Laden's presence.
Dreams of tall buildings Before the attacks, bin Laden said some associates had dreams about tall buildings in the United States.
