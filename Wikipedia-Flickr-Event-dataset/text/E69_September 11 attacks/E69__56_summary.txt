Al-Qaeda initially planned to fly hijacked jets into nuclear installations - rather than the World Trade Center and the Pentagon - according to an Arab journalist who says he interviewed two of the group's masterminds.
He says was told by a man there that Bin Laden was alive and well, but was not shown any proof of this.
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told him he was head of the al-Qaeda military committee and Ramzi Binalshibh the co-ordinator of what they refer to as "Holy Tuesday".
Over the course of two days, Mr Fouda says, the men gave him an insight into how the terror group operates and how the 11 September attacks were planned.
He concludes that there is evidence of "disruption" within the al-Qaeda leadership, and that Bin Laden is more likely dead than alive.
