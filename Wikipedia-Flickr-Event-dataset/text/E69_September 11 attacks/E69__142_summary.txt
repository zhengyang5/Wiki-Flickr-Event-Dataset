The groundbreaking move on Wednesday marked the first time the city of New York has officially declared that exposure to World Trade Center toxins following the 9/11 attacks contributed to a person's death.
The city said the September 11 death toll at the World Trade Center now stands at 2,750.
"It is likely, with certainty beyond a reasonable doubt, that exposure to WTC dust...was contributory to (Dunn-Jones') death."
Before Wednesday's decision by New York, only a county in New Jersey had tied a death to exposure to World Trade Center dust.
Zadroga, who was stricken with brain and respiratory aliments after spending close to 500 hours sifting through debris at the World Trade Center, died in January 2006.
