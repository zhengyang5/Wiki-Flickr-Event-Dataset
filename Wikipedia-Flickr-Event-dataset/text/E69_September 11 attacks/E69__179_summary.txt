Stephen Lynch agrees that the twenty-eight pages were buried in order to preserve the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia.
He characterized the twenty-eight pages as “an agglomeration of preliminary, unvetted reports” concerning Saudi involvement.
“Those twenty-eight pages tell a story that has been completely removed from the 9/11 Report,” Lynch maintains.
One of those files is titled “Finding, Discussion and Narrative Regarding Certain Sensitive National Security Matters.” It is twenty-eight pages long.
Releasing the twenty-eight pages, he said, might be a step forward.
