The document does not provide any details from Mr. Mohammed's questioning about why other proposed Sept. 11 targets were dropped.
Mr. Mohammed was captured in Pakistan on March 1 and is in United States custody.
Like Mr. bin Laden, the Egyptian-born Mr. Zawahiri is still at large.
Officials emphasized that Mr. Mohammed had not provided interrogators with any information regarding current Qaeda operations.
In addition to gas stations in New York City, Al Qaeda had also looked at water reservoirs, he said.
