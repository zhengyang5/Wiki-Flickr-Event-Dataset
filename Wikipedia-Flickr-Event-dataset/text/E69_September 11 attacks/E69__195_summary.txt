The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) administered the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition.
These committees premised their work on an initial memorial mission statement and program developed by the LMDC Families Advisory Council.
The first stage (Stage I) required the submission of design concepts on a single presentation board.
Members of the Memorial Competition jury evaluated the submissions.
The guidelines for the competition include details of the Memorial Mission Statement and Program, instructions for registration and submission, presentation requirements and recommendations, and other essential information for participation.
