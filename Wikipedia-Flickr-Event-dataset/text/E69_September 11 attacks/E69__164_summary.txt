9/11 Investigation (PENTTBOM)They were the most lethal terrorist attacks in history, taking the lives of 3,000 Americans and international citizens and ultimately leading to far-reaching changes in anti-terror approaches and operations in the U.S. and around the globe.
Our ensuing investigation of the attacks of 9/11—code-named “PENTTBOM”—was our largest investigation ever.
We followed more than half-a-million investigative leads, including several hundred thousand tips from the public.
The attack and crash sites also represented the largest crime scenes in FBI history.
