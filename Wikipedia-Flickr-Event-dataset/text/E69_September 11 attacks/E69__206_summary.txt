SHANKSVILLE, Pa. - As hundreds of firefighters bowed their heads in prayer, a cross made out of steel from the World Trade Center was dedicated Sunday near where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into the ground on Sept. 11.
"This is an effort on our part to tie the three events together: the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and Shanksville."
The cross is not part of the official $58 million Flight 93 National Memorial.
Shanksville Chief Terry Shaffer said the cross dedicated Sunday would serve as inspiration whenever his department responds to a call.
Gary Sims, a firefighter with New York's Ladder 22, was among those in the motorcycle escort and said he took part "to help carry the word," of Flight 93.
