Source: Hijacking suspects linked to Afghanistan

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- At least four of the 19 suspected hijackers implicated in this month's terrorist attacks against the United States trained at camps in Afghanistan run by suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, an intelligence source familiar with the federal investigation said Saturday.

Additionally, the source said that "most" of the hijackers had connections to al Qaeda, the network run by bin Laden. Previously, sources had named three alleged hijackers with connections to al Qaeda.

The latest links uncovered by federal investigators buttress the Bush administration's belief that bin Laden was behind the September 11 attacks in which four commercial U.S. jets were hijacked and crashed. Two jets slammed into the World Trade Center, collapsing the towers and killing thousands. Another jet hit the Pentagon, and a fourth plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania. (Full story)

President Bush said Saturday that the American people's "patience and resolve" will be tested in a methodical antiterrorist campaign, but "the cause of freedom will prevail."

"This is a different kind of war, which we will wage aggressively and methodically to disrupt and destroy terrorist activity," Bush said in his weekly radio address.

Bush recounted a number of steps the administration has taken to combat terrorism since the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. The death toll from those attacks is estimated at more than 6,000.

"We did not seek this conflict, but we will win it," Bush said. "America will act deliberately and decisively, and the cause of freedom will prevail." (Full story)
