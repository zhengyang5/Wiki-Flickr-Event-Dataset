Admitting for the first time that he ordered the Sept. 11 attacks, bin Laden said he did so because of injustices against the Lebanese and Palestinians by Israel and the United States.
Two taped messages accompanied the video; all aired on Al-Jazeera on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Bin Laden suggested Bush was slow to react to the Sept. 11 attacks, giving the hijackers more time than they expected.
The image of bin Laden reading a statement was dramatically different from the few other videos of the al-Qaeda leader that have emerged since the Sept. 11 attacks.
But in none of his previous messages, audio or video, did bin Laden directly state that he ordered the attacks.
