Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden appeared in a new message aired on an Arabic TV station Friday night, for the first time claiming direct responsibility for the 2001 attacks against the United States.
According to translators, bin Laden told American voters: "Your security is not in the hands of [Democratic presidential candidate John] Kerry or Bush or al-Qaeda.
"As Americans, we are absolutely united in our determination to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden and the terrorists," he said during a campaign stop in Florida.
Bush's delay "gave us three times the required time to carry out the operations, thanks be to God," bin Laden said.
Bin Laden also said Bush had misled the American people in the three years since al-Qaeda's 19 hijackers accomplished their deadly mission.
