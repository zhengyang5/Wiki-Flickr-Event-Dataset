A purported audio tape of Osama bin Laden aired on Al Jazeera television claimed responsibility for a Dec. 25 attempted bombing of a U.S.-bound plane, and vowed to continue attacks on the United States, as long as it supports Israel.
On Sunday's audiotape, the Al-Qaida vowed to continue attacks so long as Palestinians cannot live in peace.
"Our attacks against you will continue as long as U.S. support for Israel continues," bin Laden said.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Andy David, dismissed the latest Al-Qaida message and its attempt to link Israel with attacks on the U.S."This is nothing new, he has said this before.
The last public message from bin Laden appears to have been on Sept. 26, 2009, when he demanded that European countries pull their troops out of Afghanistan.
