After the 9/11 attacks, the public was told al Qaeda acted alone, with no state sponsors.
In fact, they got help from Saudi VIPs from coast to coast:LOS ANGELES: Saudi consulate official Fahad al-Thumairy allegedly arranged for an advance team to receive two of the Saudi hijackers — Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi — as they arrived at LAX in 2000.
(Bayoumi left the United States two months before the attacks, while Thumairy was deported back to Saudi Arabia after 9/11.)
Most suspiciously, though, Awlaki fled the United States on a Saudi jet about a year after 9/11.
Just two weeks before the 9/11 attacks, the Saudi luxury home was abandoned.
