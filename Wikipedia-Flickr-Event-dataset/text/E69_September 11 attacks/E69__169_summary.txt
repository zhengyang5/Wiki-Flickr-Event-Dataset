Osama bin Laden told a top Qaeda operative to recruit Saudis for the September 2001 hijackings in an effort to strain relations between the United States and the kingdom, a Saudi official said today.
Mr. bin Laden made his comments in a conversation with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the Qaeda operations chief captured earlier this year, said the official, who added that Mr. bin Laden's statements were related to American interrogators by Mr. Mohammed.
Mr. bin Laden is a Saudi citizen, and a number of his most ardent followers are from Saudi Arabia.
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, a number of them young men recruited only a few months before the attacks.
The official said Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Mohammed were fully aware that a Saudi-dominated hijacking plot would place a strain on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia and turn public opinion against that country.
