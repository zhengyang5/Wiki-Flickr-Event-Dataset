Post-9/11 report recommends police, fire response changes NEW YORK (AP) Â— Police and fire officials pledged Monday to improve command procedures and communications as they released two reports examining emergency response in the wake of the World Trade Center attack.
Both Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta promised to improve they way they deploy officers and firefighters in disasters.
"We've revised our mobilization procedures, controlling the number of personnel who respond at any one time to an event," said Kelly.
It says the FDNY and neighboring fire departments should develop mutual-aid procedures for assisting each other during massive emergencies.
One of the FDNY's most senior officers should oversee large-scale emergencies from the department's Brooklyn operations center instead of the scene itself, the report said.
