Over 40 percent of 9/11 families never recovered any remains of their loved ones, but that doesn’t mean city officials are giving up.
Nearly 10 years after the World Trade Center attacks, a team of scientists is still working fulltime to identify victims’ remains.
They test about 400 samples a month using the latest in DNA technology.
“We are able to get smaller amounts of DNA from pieces of remains that we test.”For years, 9/11 remains have been preserved and stored in a tent on East 30th street known as Memorial Park.
If a sample generates a DNA profile, a computer then seeks to match it against 17,000 reference samples that have been collected from victims’ families.
