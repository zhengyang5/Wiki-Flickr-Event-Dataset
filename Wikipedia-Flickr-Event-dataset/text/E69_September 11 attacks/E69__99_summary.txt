PDF version The USA PATRIOT Act: Preserving Life and Liberty(Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism)Congress enacted the Patriot Act by overwhelming, bipartisan margins, arming law enforcement with new tools to detect and prevent terrorism: The USA Patriot Act was passed nearly unanimously by the Senate 98-1, and 357-66 in the House, with the support of members from across the political spectrum.
The Patriot Act allows investigators to use the tools that were already available to investigate organized crime and drug trafficking .
The Patriot Act facilitated information sharing and cooperation among government agencies so that they can better "connect the dots ."
Before the Patriot Act, law enforcement personnel were required to obtain a search warrant in the district where they intended to conduct a search.
The government's success in preventing another catastrophic attack on the American homeland since September 11, 2001, would have been much more difficult, if not impossible, without the USA Patriot Act.
