It may also represent well how the broadcasters in New York City met this nation's most recent tragedy.
Up until the early 70s, nearly all New York OTA television was broadcast from the Empire State Building.
With the WTC tragedy, however, it has become perhaps the most important tower site on the East Coast.
Andrew Corp. supplied Heliax cable to broadcasters at the emergency New Jersey broadcast site.
The Empire State Building site does not have the infrastructure to handle all the increased demand.
