The Pentagon Memorial was designed in a studio on Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan, but not the kind with skyline views or a brass nameplate on the office door.
A place like no other, they told each other.
They did not even have a name for their design firm, so they thought of their tiny apartment and called it Kaseman Beckman Amsterdam Studio, KBAS for short.
They still call their firm KBAS, only now it is an abbreviation for Kaseman Beckman Advanced Strategies.
And today, their long-shot idea is a real, physical place.
