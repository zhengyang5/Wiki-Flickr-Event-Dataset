New York City's 9/11 "Wall Of Heroes" will now include names of police officers who died well after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
James Zadroga was the first NYPD officer to have his death directly linked to his work at ground zero.
Subsequently, he emerged as a symbol for the plight of thousands whose health rapidly deteriorated after their long days toiling in the rubble at ground zero.
It marked the first time the city officially linked a death to the toxic dust caused by the World Trade Center's collapse.
Of the 70,000 people taking part in Mount Sinai Medical Center's World Trade Center health study, 85 percent are suffering some kind of respiratory problem.
