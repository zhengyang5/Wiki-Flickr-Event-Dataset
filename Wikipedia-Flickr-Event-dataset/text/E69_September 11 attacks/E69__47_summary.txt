This still from a video shot by an astronaut from the International Space Station offers a new perspective on world history.
As he looks down on New York from space, a vast plume of smoke hangs over the harbour.
This startling off-world perspective is a reminder more than a decade on of the scale of what happened that day.
He was sitting safely in a tin can far above the earth and there was nothing he could do to help.
Witnessing world events does not not mean knowing what to do about them.
