Eleven years after the fact, Mr. Bush has been treated like a prophet without honor in his own land.
Yet there was always another side to Mr. Bush, present in his self-definition as a “compassionate conservative,” in his deep faith and respect for all religions.
So television and still cameras would be able to capture the image of an American president in a visibly, indelibly Islamic setting.
Then, on the afternoon of Monday, Sept. 17, Mr. Bush and all the attendant news media went to the mosque.
He met for about 45 minutes with leaders of several American Muslim organizations, including Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
