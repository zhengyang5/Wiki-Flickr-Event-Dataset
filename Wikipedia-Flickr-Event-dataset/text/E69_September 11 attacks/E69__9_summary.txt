Pakistan will be giving the Taliban militia who rule Afghanistan an ultimatum: Hand over Usama bin Laden or else.
Bin Laden has denied any connection to the attacks, though he has praised them.
The Taliban say bin Laden is a guest.
The Taliban's reclusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, has said in the past that delivering bin Laden to non-Muslims would be akin to betraying a tenet of Islam.
Reuters reported Sunday that Musharraf said that if an international coalition forms against the Taliban, "Pakistan is compelled to be there."
