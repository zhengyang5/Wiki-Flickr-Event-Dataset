Hate crime reports up in wake of terrorist attacks ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Reports of hate crimes against Muslims and southeast Asians have risen exponentially across the U.S. in the wake of Tuesday's terror attacks.
In Mesa, Arizona, a man was charged with first-degree murder Sunday in connection with a series of shootings that police said could be a racially-motivated response to last week's terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
He was charged with carrying a knife, but was later cleared of any connection to the terrorist attacks.
In Texas, mosques in Irving and Denton were attacked last week in the wake of the terror attacks.
Attacks on Muslims and mosques are often triggered by news reports, the group said, from the latest violence in the Middle East, the destruction of the Taliban statues in Afghanistan, to terrorist attacks such as the ones on Tuesday.
