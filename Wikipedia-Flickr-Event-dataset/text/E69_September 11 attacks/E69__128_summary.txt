HASAN SARBAKHSHIN/APCandle PowerIran mourns America's deadSeptember 18, 2001: Iranian women light candles in Tehran's Mohseni Square in memory of the victims of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington DC.
Even the most hardline Islamic clerics, who despise the United States, have been shocked into silence by the attacks.
President Mohammad Khatami set the tone for Iran's reaction with a statement that in Persian rang with deep compassion: "On behalf of the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic, I denounce the terrorist measures, which led to the killing of defenseless people, and I express my deep sorrow and sympathy with the American people."
