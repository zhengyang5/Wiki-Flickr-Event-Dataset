Islamabad: Pervez Musharraf was "bullied"

into supporting the US in its `war on terror`, claimed

Pakistan`s former Chief of General Staff Shahid Aziz, who also

accused the ex-President of deceiving other army officers and

corps commanders in the decision leading up to the

anti-Taliban campaign.

Aziz said the decision to support America was taken

unilaterally before a crucial corps commanders meeting took

place.

The former Pakistan`s Chief of General staff

underlined that Musharraf was "bullied" into supporting the US

in the war on terror. The corps commanders were reluctant to

support the US, he told Dawn news in an interview.

Aziz said that the corps commanders wanted to remain

neutral in the war against the Taliban instead of actively

supporting it.

Aziz also said that Pakistan`s army intelligence had

informed them about Indian lobbying, calling for attacks on

both Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Musharraf quit as President in August last year to

avoid being impeached. Over the past few months, a slew of

cases and police complaints have been registered against

Musharraf across Pakistan after the Supreme Court declared in

July that the emergency imposed by him was illegal and

unconstitutional.

Musharraf, who has been living outside Pakistan since

mid-April, has ignored several summons issued by different

courts, including the Supreme Court.
