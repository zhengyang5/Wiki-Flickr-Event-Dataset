The GSPC is believed to have received funding from bin Laden, and to have sent members to his Afghan training camps.
Italian authorities are looking for any links between the group arrested last Friday - which included a Pakistani (suspected as the ringleader), a Tunisian, an Algerian and three Iraqis - and a group of nine Moroccans arrested earlier this month after the discovery of a perforation in a tunnel near the US Embassy.
So far, the only links between the two groups are cyanide and a mosque whose address was found in the Moroccans' apartment.
Along with the cyanide compound, police found a gunpowder substance that could have created the heat needed to release the cyanide gas, he says.
Mr. Mazza says that they were "in telephone contact with people high up in Al Qaeda and in particular with people running training camps in Afghanistan."
