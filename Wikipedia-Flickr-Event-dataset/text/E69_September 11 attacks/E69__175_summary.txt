(05-17) 15:42 PDT WASHINGTON (AP) --A bipartisan group of senators is pushing legislation that would force the CIA to release an inspector general's report on the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
"The American people have a right to know what the Central Intelligence Agency was doing in those critical months before 9/11....
Wyden, who has read the classified report several times, wouldn't offer any details on its findings or the conversations he has had with CIA Director Michael Hayden, former CIA Director Porter Goss and former National Intelligence Director John Negroponte.
He also said the decision to classify the report has nothing to do with national security, but rather political security.
The agency's actions prior to Sept. 11 have gotten renewed attention with the release of a memoir by former CIA director George Tenet.
