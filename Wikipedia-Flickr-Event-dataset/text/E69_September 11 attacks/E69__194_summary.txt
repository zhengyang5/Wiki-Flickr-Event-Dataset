Tribute in light to New York victimsTwo vertical mile-high shafts of light will beam into the night sky near the World Trade Center from Monday 11 March.
The "Tribute in Light" to the victims of the 11 September attacks will be unveiled exactly six months to the day since the attacks occurred, the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, announced on Tuesday.
The Tribute in Light will be installed in a vacant space next to the wreckage of the World Trade Center.
The other, The Sphere, is a sculpture of steel and bronze that once stood in the plaza between the twin towers.
The light column was originally to have been called Towers of Light, but protests from victims' families forced a name change.
