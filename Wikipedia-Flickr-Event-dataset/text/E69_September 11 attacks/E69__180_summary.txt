President Obama vetoes the National Defense Authorization Act in October 2015.
"I recognize that there is nothing that could ever erase the grief the 9/11 families have endured," Obama said.
The White House had been stalling for time in hopes of changing minds on Capitol Hill.
"We certainly are counting votes and having a number of conversations with members of Congress in both parties and both houses of Congress," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday.
The veto was the 12th of Obama's presidency, and the first to face the serious prospect of a veto override.
