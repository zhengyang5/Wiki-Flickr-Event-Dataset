On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country.
All of this was brought upon us in a single day -- and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.
They hate our freedoms -- our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.
This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion.
Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral between them.
