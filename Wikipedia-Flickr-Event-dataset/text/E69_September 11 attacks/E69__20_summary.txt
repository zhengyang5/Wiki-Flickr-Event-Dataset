The creation of an interrogations unit to be supervised directly by the White House is a breathtaking power grab by Mr. Obama, who has already demonstrated his penchant for expanding executive control by appointing three dozen issue-specific “czars” who are accountable to no one but him.
Mr. Obama now aims to run terrorist interrogations right from the Oval Office.
When President Richard Nixon consolidated national security decision-making in the White House, his liberal critics went bananas, accusing him of trying to end-run Congress.
This unit will invest Mr. Obama with unprecedented power for which there will be no congressional oversight.
This opens them up to possible criminal prosecution, which in turn, will have a deathly chilling effect on all CIA officers in the field.
