The indomitable mayor of New York City had spent the day and night holding his town together.
Now, around 2:30 a.m., Giuliani walked into the Upper East Side apartment of Howard Koeppel and his longtime partner, Mark Hsiao.
From midmorning on Sept. 11, when Giuliani and fellow New Yorkers were fleeing for their lives, the mayor had been thinking of Churchill.
With the President out of sight for most of that day, Giuliani became the voice of America.
After two terms, his place in history seemed secure: great mayor, not-so-great guy.
