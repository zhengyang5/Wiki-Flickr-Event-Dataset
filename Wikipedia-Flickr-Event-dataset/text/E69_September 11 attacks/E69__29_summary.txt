They also cased target flights to Hong Kong and Seoul that would have onward legs to the United States.
In addition to staging actual terrorist attacks in partnership with al Qaeda, Hambali and JI assisted al Qaeda operatives passing through Kuala Lumpur.
Thus, like any powerful bureaucrat defending his domain, Hambali objected when al Qaeda leadership tried to assign JI members to terrorist projects without notifying him.26 Abd al Rahim al NashiriKSM and Hambali both decided to join forces with al Qaeda because their terrorist aspirations required the money and manpower that only a robust organization like al Qaeda could supply.
Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance.
