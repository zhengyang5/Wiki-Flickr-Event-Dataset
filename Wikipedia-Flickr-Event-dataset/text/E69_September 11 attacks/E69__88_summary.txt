THE SEPT. 11 COMMISSION Cheney Gave Order to Shoot Down Jets9/11 commission staff seems to question whether Bush OKd the command.
The normal chain of command for military "engage" orders goes from the president to the secretary of Defense, and not through the vice president, it said.
The order given by Cheney was never received by the fighter pilots, and, in the end, it came too late to interrupt the assault.
Although Cheney said he conferred with the president before giving the order, the commission staff could not confirm that a phone call took place in that time frame.
Several minutes after giving the order, Cheney informed Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld that he had done so.
