The new disclosures come amid a debate over whether the surveillance court, which hears arguments only from the Justice Department, should be restructured for its evolving role.
In May 2002, the surveillance court rejected a request to dismantle a “wall” that inhibited criminal prosecutors from working closely with intelligence investigators using FISA surveillance; that fall, a review court overturned the ruling.
Current and former officials said only trained analysts with a need to see the raw information may access it.
The documents do not explicitly say the Large Content FISA orders were the January 2007 decisions but are consistent with that explanation.
to raw FISA information was initially limited to its headquarters at Fort Meade, Md.
