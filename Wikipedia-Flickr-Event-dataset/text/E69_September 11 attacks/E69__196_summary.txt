Without political ceremony, construction began on the World Trade Center memorial Monday morning, while relatives of some of the Sept. 11 victims headed to court to fight plans to build over the twin towers' historic footprints.
Some Sept. 11 families that oppose the underground memorial design are trying to stop the work before it is set in concrete.
The Coalition of 9/11 Families last week filed a lawsuit charging that the memorial would damage the historic footprints.
Tallon began sleeping outside her brother Sean's firehouse across from the trade center site last week, and said Monday's construction work wouldn't stop her protest.
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation has raised more than $100 million of a $500 million goal; it still has not calculated the costs of operating the facility.
