Osama bin Laden speaks in 1998 at a meeting at an undisclosed location in Afghanistan.
In one scene, bin Laden addresses the camera, calling on followers to support the hijackers.
"I ask you to pray for them and to ask God to make them successful, aim their shots well, set their feet strong and strengthen their hearts," bin Laden said.
Bin Laden is also seen conferring with men identified as former lieutenant Mohammed Atef and Ramzi Binalshibh.
While it is believed that bin Laden has delivered audio messages in recent months, he has not yet appeared in any video footage after 2004.
