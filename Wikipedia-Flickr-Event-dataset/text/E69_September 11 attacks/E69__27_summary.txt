"He had no connection at all with Sept. 11," the speaker claiming to be bin Laden said in the tape posted on the Internet.
Two counterterrorism officials in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. intelligence is aware of the bin Laden message.
Bin Laden also said that none of the hundreds of terror suspects held at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was involved and most had no ties to al-Qaida.
Bin Laden called all the detainees innocent, claiming they were jailed to justify the cost of the war on terror.
The al-Qaida chief said the Sept. 11 hijackers were divided into two groups, "pilots and assistants."
