Spain's High Court today jailed 18 al-Qaeda operatives, including the Syrian head of a Spanish-based cell found to have helped to organise the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, as Europe's largest trial involving Osama bin Laden's network concluded.
He was regarded as having led a Spanish-based al-Qaeda cell under investigation since 1995.
The prosecution had accused Dahdah and a Moroccan, Driss Chebli, of arranging a July 2001 meeting in Tarragona, northeastern Spain, attended by Mohamed Atta, ringleader of the September 11 hijackers.
Chebli was given six years in jail after being found guilty of collaborating with al-Qaeda.
They included Jamel Zougam, a Moroccan and alleged acquaintance of Abu Dahdah who is a prime suspect in the Madrid train bombings.
