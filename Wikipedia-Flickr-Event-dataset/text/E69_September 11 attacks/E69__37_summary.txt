And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 - may Allah have mercy on them.
Whereas thinking people, when disaster strikes, make it their priority to look for its causes, in order to prevent it happening again.
I say to you, Allah knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers.
And that the wise man doesn't squander his security, wealth and children for the sake of the liar in the White House.
In conclusion, I tell you in truth, that your security is not in the hands of Kerry, nor Bush, nor al-Qaida.
