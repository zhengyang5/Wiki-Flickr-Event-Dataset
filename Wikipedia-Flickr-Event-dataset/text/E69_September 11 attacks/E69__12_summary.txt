The Arabic television channel Al-Jazeera said Saturday that it received the latest videotaped message from al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden at its offices in the Pakistani capital.
U.S. officials told NBC News that there was no plan to raise the terrorist threat level, currently at yellow, or “elevated,” because bin Laden makes no specific threat.
In no previous authenticated message — audio or video — had bin Laden explicitly stated that he ordered the 2001 attacks, which killed almost 3,000 people.
In the course of his comments, bin Laden revealed just how patiently he awaited his opportunity to strike the West.
At one point, bin Laden ridicules Bush for reacting slowly to the 2001 attacks.
