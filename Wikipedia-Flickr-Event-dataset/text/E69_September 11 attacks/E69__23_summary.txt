The ACLU described the memo as "one of the most important torture documents still being withheld by the Bush administration."
"This memo authorized the CIA to use specific torture techniques — including waterboarding," Jameel Jaffer, ACLU’s national security project director, said in a statement.
"CIA agents waterboarded prisoners because this memo told them that they could," he said.
The U.S. military has banned the use of waterboarding and other harsh methods considered by some rights advocates to be torture.
The CIA has said it used waterboarding during the interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who faces murder charges in the U.S. military court at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
