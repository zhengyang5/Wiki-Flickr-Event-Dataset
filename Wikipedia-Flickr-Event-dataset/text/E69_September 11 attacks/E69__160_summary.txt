For many people of faith, the face of God was altered on Sept. 11 -- the old, comforting images no longer sufficed -- while for atheists and agnostics, it was not God but humanity that was called into question.
We all know we have pictures of God, different pictures, and that those pictures aren't God -- that there's a difference between our pictures of God and whoever God is.
I guess I constantly struggle with [the image of God], because oftentimes the God that I want is not the God I want to believe in.
I also know it's ridiculous at another level to believe in that God, because if that God exists, that God was dethroned a long time ago.
Something I have to define myself against, whether that's God, or whether that's a Christian, or whether that's a Muslim, or whether that's a Buddhist.
