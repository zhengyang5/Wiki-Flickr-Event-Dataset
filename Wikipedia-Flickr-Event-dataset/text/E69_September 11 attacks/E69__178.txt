(CNN) â€“ A grim milestone this week, as the nation commemorates the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

Some of those still grieving the losses of family members from that horrific day are also on a mission to declassify 28 pages from the congressional investigation into the attacks, pages specifically focused on the role of foreign governments in the al Qaeda plot.

These 9/11 family members say President Obama personally promised he would declassify those 28 pages, but now they say the White House does not even acknowledge them, or their requests.

CNN's Jake Tapper reports.

Editors note: After the airing of our report, National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden issued this response:

"Earlier this summer the White House requested that ODNI review the 28 pages from the joint inquiry for declassification. ODNI is currently coordinating the required interagency review and it is ongoing."
