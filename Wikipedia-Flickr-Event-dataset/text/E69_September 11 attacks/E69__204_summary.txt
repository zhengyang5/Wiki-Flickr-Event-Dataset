Felt, who is the president of Families of Flight 93 and was a driving force behind the center’s construction, became one of the first people to see inside.
“It’s the architect’s way of preparing you to see the crash site and orienting you to the flight path,” said Jeffrey Reinbold, an assistant director at the park service and a former superintendent for parks in Western Pennsylvania.
But most of the center is devoted to the last 35 minutes of Flight 93.
PhotoAlong another wall, full-size replicas of the seats in Flight 93 show the air phones that several passengers and flight attendants used to contact loved ones or report the emergency.
“The beauty of the setting and the searingly poignant nature of the visitor center exhibits make this a required destination,” said Lisa Linden, the spokeswoman for the Families of Flight 93.
