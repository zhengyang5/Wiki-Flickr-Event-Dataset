And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 - may Allah have mercy on them.
We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation.
So shall we lay waste to yours.
Whereas thinking people, when disaster strikes, make it their priority to look for its causes, in order to prevent it happening again.
So I shall talk to you about the story behind those events and shall tell you truthfully about the moments in which the decision was taken, for you to consider.
