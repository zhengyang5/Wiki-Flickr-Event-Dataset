Skyscraper Protection Might Not Be Feasible, Federal Engineers Say U.S. & LATIN AMERICASaying it was "remarkable" that the towers remained standing as long as they did, the engineers warned that it "may not be technically feasible" or cost-effective to design structural safeguards to protect other skyscrapers from toppling in similar attacks.
"Resources should be directed primarily to aviation and other security measures rather than to hardening buildings against airplane impact," stated the report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and American Society of Civil Engineers.
New standards might be needed to evaluate fire resistance along with changes in building codes, the report said.
Specialists also should look for feasible design changes to limit or stop collapses that have begun, it said.
But the design plan did not take into account the consequences of jet fuel and a massive fire, engineers said.
