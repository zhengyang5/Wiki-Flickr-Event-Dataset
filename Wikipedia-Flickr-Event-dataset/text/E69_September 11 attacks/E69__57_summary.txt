A Winnipeg woman whose partner was killed in the 9/11 terror attacks is heading to New York this weekend to mark the 10th anniversary of the tragedy.
Ellen Judd lost her partner, Christine Egan, in one of the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center when they were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001.
The 9/11 memorial is two square pools located where the Twin Towers formerly stood and inscribed with the names of those who died in the terror attacks.
Egan, who was passionate about nursing in the north, worked in Winnipeg for Health Canada as a nurse epidemiologist.
After the Twin Towers were hit, the hijackers crashed a third plane into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.
