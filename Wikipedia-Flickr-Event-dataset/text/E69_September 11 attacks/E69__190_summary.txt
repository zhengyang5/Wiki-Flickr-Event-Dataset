Phoenix rises: Pentagon honors 'hard-hat patriots'By Christy OglesbyCNN(CNN) -- A Wednesday afternoon Pentagon ceremony -- the second at the site that day -- focused on renewal and determination as speakers honored the reconstruction crews who worked there after terrorists damaged the building a year ago.
A video presentation called "Phoenix Rising" launched the service with images of devastation and rejuvenation as the crowd watched, then erupted in applause.
Dubbed Project Phoenix, the repairs cost close to $700 million, included new safety features and ended a month ahead of schedule.
Pentagon victims included 64 airline passengers and 125 people at the Pentagon -- 22 soldiers, 47 Army civilian employees, six Army contractors, 33 sailors, six Navy civilian employees, three Navy contractors and eight other Defense Department employees.
One had a relative on the plane; four had relatives who worked at the Pentagon.
