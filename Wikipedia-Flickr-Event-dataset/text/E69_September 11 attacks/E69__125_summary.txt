President Mohammad Khatami of Iran yesterday branded as extremist Osama bin Laden's version of Islam and said it did not represent the majority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims.
"I don't believe that his message really resonates strongly in the Muslim world," Mr. Khatami said in an interview with The New York Times.
Heedless of the threat, Mr. Khatami addressed the General Assembly yesterday.
The Iranian President has harshly criticized those who have sought to portray Islam as a religion of hate opposed to the West.
Mr. Khatami categorically rejected charges that Iran supports terrorism, as he has done consistently in the past.
