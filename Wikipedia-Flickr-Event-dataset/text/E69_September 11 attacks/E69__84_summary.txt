Path Service Restoration PATH Service Restoration After September 11th, the PATH Terminal was destroyed, the tunnels connecting the terminal to New Jersey were flooded, and Exchange Place service had to be terminated because the station could not operate as a terminal.
All tunnel components (fiber optic cables, conduits, pipes, lighting, as well as ductbanks, track, contact rail and ballast) needed to be replaced.
New switches and tunnel connections also needed to be established.
In order to restore PATH service to Lower Manhattan, the Exchange Place Station in New Jersey was upgraded, the tunnels connecting Exchange Place with New York restored, and a temporary station constructed at the World Trade Center (WTC) site.
In December 2001, the Port Authority's Board of Commissioner authorized a multi-million dollar program for this immediate restoration work.
