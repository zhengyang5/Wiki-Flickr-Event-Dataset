Security officials say that Khan's interrogation revealed the extent of al-Qaeda operations in which Libbi and Farooqi were involved.
The two were learned to be actively communicating with al-Qaeda operatives outside Pakistan and in particular in the UK.
According to Pakistani security officials, the arrest last December of six militants from Karachi provided the authorities with some "critical intelligence" about Libbi's whereabouts.
Libbi's arrest is also a significant indicator of the success of intelligence sharing between Pakistan and the US.
Islamists in Pakistan have repeatedly accused the Musharraf government of letting US agents operate on Pakistan soil.
