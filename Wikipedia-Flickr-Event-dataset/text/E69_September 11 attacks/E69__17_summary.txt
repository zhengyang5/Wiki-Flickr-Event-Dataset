Yosri Fouda of the Arabic television channel al-Jazeera is the only journalist to have interviewed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the al-Qaida military commander arrested at the weekend.
Before the September 11 attacks few people, even intelligence agents, had heard of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
"You do not need to know more than that at this stage, and anyway it was eventually decided to leave out nuclear targets for now."
When Ramzi bin al-Shibh was arrested on the first anniversary of their "finest hour", September 11, I was surprised.
I am shocked by the unceremonious arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
