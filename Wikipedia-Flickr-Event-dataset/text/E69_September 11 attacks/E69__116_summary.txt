SE Asia unites to smash militant cellsStaff and wiresKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines have signed an anti-terror pact in a bid to smash militant cells operating in the region.
The world's largest Muslim nation, Indonesia, has drawn criticism over a lack of arrests of extremists or members of religious groups with alleged terrorism ties.
A key part of the pact will be trying to curb the activities of a militant network they say is bent on carving out an Islamic state from the Malay Archipelago.
"But what is their Islamic state I don't know, because I haven't seen them do anything except do a lot of damage to people, carry out a lot of terrorist attacks."
Singapore arrested members of a militant cell in December that it said was planning attacks on U.S. targets on the island.
