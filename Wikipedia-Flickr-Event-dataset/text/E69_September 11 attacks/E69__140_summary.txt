That is why the battle for Herat in southwest Afghanistan on Monday, November 12, stood out from the Northern Alliance’s other rapid-fire wins.
Forewarned, the Iranians waylaid the US Special Forces as they landed on the salt flats of southern Iran.
Then was the first time in US military history that special forces were armed with computerized communications, navigation and targeting equipment.
A group of eight to 10 US Special Forces officers joined them as the advance guard of the Northern Alliance.
Oddly enough, the American team is still in Tehran even after Herat’s fall, Khan’s takeover and his attempts to consolidate his rule with the help of the Iranian Special Forces still there.
