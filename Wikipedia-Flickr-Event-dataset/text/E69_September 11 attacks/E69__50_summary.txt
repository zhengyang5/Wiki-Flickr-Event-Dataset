T. OLSON: Barbara didn't mind double, triple, quadruple gifts.
Barbara Olson was on American Air flight 77 that left Dulles bound for Los Angeles and crashed into the Pentagon.
I said I didn't think -- I thought that -- I was hoping that it wasn't true, but I was very worried.
Of course, I knew a lot of stories, but there's a lot of stories out there that I didn't know.
Barbara Olson will always be remembered for her sharp mind, for her kindness, for her cheerful presence.
