Ceremony closes 'Ground Zero' cleanupNEW YORK (CNN) -- Eight months and 19 days after the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center were brought down by hijacked airliners, the cleanup and recovery efforts at Ground Zero officially ended Thursday with a brief and somber ceremony.
The ceremony began with the sound of a fire bell ringing for a fallen firefighter at 10:29 a.m.
It was followed by a flatbed truck carrying the last 50-ton steel column from the site of the Trade Center ruins.
The ceremony marked the end of cleanup efforts after eight months and 108,342 truckloads of debris.
In addition to the 16-acre World Trade Center site itself, light poles still bear banners urging New Yorkers to "Salute our heroes."
