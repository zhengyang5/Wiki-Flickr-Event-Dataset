Operation Enduring Freedom - OperationsOperation Enduring Freedom began on 7 October 2001, four weeks after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on America.
The first US troops on the ground in Afghanistan were Special Operation Forces who were sent in to engage in one of their specialties: unconventional warfare tactics alongside opposition forces; in this case, anti-Taliban groups.
As forces had attacked "Caves and Tunnels" to deny the enemy safe harbor, "Radio Broadcast and Leaflet Programs" had effectively informed the population of US goals and encouraged enemy forces to surrender.
The operation was designed to assault enemy forces in southeastern Afghanistan.
Eventually this task was passed to Combined Joint Task Force Phoenix, initially headed by elements of the 10th Mountain Division (Light), who initiated various training programs for the fledgling ANA).
