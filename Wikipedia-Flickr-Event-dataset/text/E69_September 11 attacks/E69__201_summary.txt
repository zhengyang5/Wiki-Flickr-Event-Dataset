Her husband, Eddie Dillard, was one of 184 victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the Pentagon.
Yesterday, Dillard and a handful of other victims' family members got their first look at the construction of the Pentagon memorial since the groundbreaking nearly a year ago.
Eddie Dillard was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77 when terrorists seized control of the jet and crashed it into the Pentagon.
Rosemary Dillard is vice president of the Pentagon Memorial Fund and has been involved with the project since the idea was first raised weeks after the attack.
For Dillard, the two-acre Pentagon memorial site is sacred ground, a place where she will often come to sit and remember her beloved Eddie.
