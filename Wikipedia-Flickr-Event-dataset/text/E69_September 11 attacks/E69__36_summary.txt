Millions of words have been written about Bin Laden, but almost all of them by people who have never met him.
Mullah Omar angrily insisted that there could only be one ruler of Afghanistan - Bin Laden or himself.
In Pakistani cities, firms are named after him, too: Osama Medical Stores; Osama Property Services.
I first met Mullah Omar in Kandahar in March 1995, the first journalist to do so.
I have not spoken to Mullah Omar or to Osama Bin Laden since the events of September 11, but I have spoken several times with senior Taliban figures.
