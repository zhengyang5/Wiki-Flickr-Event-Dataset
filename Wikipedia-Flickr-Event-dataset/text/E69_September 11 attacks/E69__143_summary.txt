But even in diseases closely related to dust, making a binding connection to ground zero exposure is hard.
In testimony before a Congressional committee in February, Dr. Kerry J. Kelly, chief medical officer of the Fire Department, outlined the department's concerns about lung diseases.
Yet the Police Pension Board has ruled that working at ground zero did not cause the death of a police officer who developed the disease.
After his lung collapsed in March 2004, Officer Godbee, a former marine and 19-year police veteran, grew frail and listless.
"There's no way you can't get sick after smelling all that dust and dirt," said Mrs. Godbee, a school guidance counselor.
