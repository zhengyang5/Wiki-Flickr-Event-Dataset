Smoke billows from a building after a Taliban attack in Gereshk district of Helmand province, Afghanistan March 9, 2016.
“The Taliban have heavily armed, uniformed units that are equipped with night vision and modern weapons,” said Sayed Murad, a special forces commander.
Already said to be in control of or contesting the majority of Helmand’s districts, Taliban fighters continue to attack all around Lashkar Gah.
“I am assuring the people in Helmand that (the Taliban) won’t be able to overrun our districts, let alone capture Lashkar Gah,” he said.
“It is not the regular Taliban force with a pair of sandals and an AK-47,” said one senior government official in Lashkar Gah.
