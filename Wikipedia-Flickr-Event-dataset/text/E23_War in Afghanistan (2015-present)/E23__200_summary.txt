The moment a U.S. helicopter strike blasts an Afghan man to pieces... as the pilot sings 'Bye, bye Miss American Pie'It is the horrific moment an Afghan man is blown apart by a US missile.
But in a moment of twisted inspiration an American helicopter pilot decided to give it a impromptu soundtrack - by singing ‘Bye, bye Miss American pie.’He belted out the most famous line of the Don McLean classic at the moment of impact when a fireball consumed at least one man.
The caption reads: ‘At the 01:39 mark you can hear the pilot singing ‘Bye Bye Ms. American Pie’ right before impact then BOOM....the rest is history.’Another pilot can also be heard saying, ‘Nice’ moments after the impact.
Based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the 101st Airborne Division became famous for their courage in World War II, the Vietnam War and the first Gulf War.
Then there was the ‘Thrill Kill’ squad which murdered three Afghan civilians for sport and took their body parts as trophies.
