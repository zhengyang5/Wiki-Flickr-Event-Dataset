The Taliban recently launched an offensive in northern Afghanistan that brought its fighters to the outskirts of Kunduz city, a provincial capital.
One Taliban participant in the talks told Reuters by phone late on Sunday that an eight-member Taliban delegation, headed by Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, had held direct dialogue with Afghan officials.
“Then the dialogue started openly, and the Afghan delegation and Qayyum Kochai, uncle of (Afghan) President Ashraf Ghani, demanded we stop our fighting and announce a ceasefire.
Taliban and Afghan sources have said the Qatar dialogue was also attended by representatives of several countries including the U.S., China and Pakistan.
“Pakistan fully supports peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban in Qatar,” said Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, the foreign secretary of Pakistan.
