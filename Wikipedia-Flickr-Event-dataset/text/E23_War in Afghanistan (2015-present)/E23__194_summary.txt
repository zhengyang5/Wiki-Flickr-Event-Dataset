US President Barack Obama says American soldiers shown in photos apparently abusing Afghan corpses in 2010 should be held accountable, a spokesman said.
The pictures, published in the Los Angeles Times, shows the soldiers posing with the mangled remains of suspected suicide bombers.
The pictures in the Los Angeles Times newspaper apparently show soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division posing with the remains in Afghanistan's eastern Zabul province.
Another set of photos - from a few months later - apparently shows soldiers from the same division holding a dead man's hand with the middle finger raised.
Last month, a US soldier was charged with the murders of 17 Afghan civilians - including nine children - in the southern province of Kandahar.
