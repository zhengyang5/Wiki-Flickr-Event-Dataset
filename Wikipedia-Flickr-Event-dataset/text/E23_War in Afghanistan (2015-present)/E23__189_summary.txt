Today, Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01) along with Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (CA-46), Loretta Sanchez (CA-47) and Steve King (IA-05) held a press conference in Berlin, Germany, on their private meeting with Northern Alliance Leaders on Afghan Strategy.
These leaders who fought with embedded Special Forces to initially defeat the Taliban represent over 60-percent of the Afghan people, yet are being entirely disregarded by the Obama and Karzai Administrations in negotiations.
Rep. Gohmert and the individuals, listed below, released the following joint statement:â€œWe have supported the mission of the Coalition Forces in Afghanistan.
Our concern is that the present political system is dysfunctional because all the power is centralized in a way that no American would tolerate in the United States.
Prior to being elected to serve in Congress, Louie was elected to three terms as District Judge in Smith County, Texas.
