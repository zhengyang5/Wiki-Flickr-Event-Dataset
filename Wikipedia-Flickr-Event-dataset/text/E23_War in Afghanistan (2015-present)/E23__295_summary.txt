The 500 soldiers will not increase the overall number of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.
A spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan says the new Army troops will not “participate in combat operations.”The decision follows a series of clashes with Taliban forces.
A Quick Reaction Force was sent to reinforce special operations team and Afghan forces engaged with the Taliban.
“That mission has not changed for the U.S. troops on the ground – providing training and assistance to those Afghan forces,” he added.
The 500 soldiers deployed there have to occupy a former U.S. base in Afghanistan turned over to Afghan forces at the end of 2014.
