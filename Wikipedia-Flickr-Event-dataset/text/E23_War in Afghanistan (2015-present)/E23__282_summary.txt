The Taliban overran the district center and several military and police installations in Now Zad in the southern Afghan province of Helmand yesterday.
According to the Taliban report, Afghan security forces “abandoned” five outposts and withdrew from the district center after the jihadist group massed for an assault.
The Taliban offensive in Helmand has stretched the Afghan security forces thin.

The Taliban regrouped and began attacking Afghan security forces as US forces began their withdrawal.
