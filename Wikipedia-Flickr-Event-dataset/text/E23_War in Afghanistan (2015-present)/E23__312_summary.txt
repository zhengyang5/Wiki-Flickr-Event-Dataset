The fighting in Helmand, where the government has lost control of most territory beyond the provincial capital, has Afghan leaders scrambling to prevent the fall of the district.
Reinforcements were sent to the scene of the battle on Tuesday, and the governmentâ€™s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, flew into the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, along with senior security officials for emergency meetings.
Six districts are contested, and six others are largely controlled by the Taliban.
With the Taliban at the gates of Lashkar Gah, the fear that another major provincial capital will fall has led the NATO mission in Afghanistan to take a greater advisory role there.
Mr. Mirajan said the fact that the Taliban could tunnel right under an army base and set off explosives showed how limited the movement of Afghan forces had become in the district center.
