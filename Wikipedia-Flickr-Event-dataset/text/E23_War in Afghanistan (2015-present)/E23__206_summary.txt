Eklil Hakimi, Ambassador of Afghanistan in Washington, is leading the Afghan negotiating team while Ambassador James Warlick, Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, is leading the United States negotiating team.
The BSA negotiations are to be conducted taking into account the November 2011 Traditional Loya Jirga’s recommendation that strategic cooperation between the United States and Afghanistan is important for the political, economic and security development, and progress of Afghanistan.
Both sides clarified that these negotiations are premised on the understanding that the United States does not seek permanent military bases in Afghanistan, or a presence that is perceived as a threat to Afghanistan’s neighbors.
