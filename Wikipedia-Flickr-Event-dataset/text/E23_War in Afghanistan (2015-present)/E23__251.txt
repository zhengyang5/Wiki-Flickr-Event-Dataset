Afghan security forces kill six attackers who tried to storm parliament

Lawmakers were inside preparing to review a defense minister nominee

Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) A woman and a child were killed Monday when Taliban militants staged an attack around the Afghan parliament as lawmakers were about to review a government nominee for defense minister.

A large car bomb exploded near the outer wall of the compound, sending up a thick plume of smoke. Six Taliban fighters then tried to storm inside, said police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi. Twenty-eight people were wounded in the attack.

Afghan security forces managed to fend off the attackers, who then moved into a nearby building, firing rockets and AK-47 machine guns. All six attackers were killed in the ensuing firefight, Karimi said.

Inside the parliament building, lawmakers were gathered in a meeting hall when the first explosion struck, Arif Rahmani, a member of parliament, told CNN.

The blast shattered glass and shook loose a thin layer of the ceiling that filled the hall with a cloud of dust, he said.
