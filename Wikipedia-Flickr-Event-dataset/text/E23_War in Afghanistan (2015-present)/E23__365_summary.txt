The U.S. military dropped its largest non-nuclear bomb on an ISIS tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday, a U.S. defense official confirmed to Fox News.
By comparison, each Tomahawk cruise missile launched at a Syrian military air base last week weighed 1,000 pounds each.
Pentagon spokesman Adam Stump said the bomb had been brought to Afghanistan "some time ago" for potential use.
"We kicked it out the back door," one U.S. official told Fox News.
The strike came just days after a Green Beret was killed fighting ISIS in Nangarhar, however, a U.S. defense official told Fox News the bombing had nothing to do with that casualty.
