The Afghan army killed a militant commander who had claimed allegiance to the ISIL extremist group, the ministry of defense said on Monday.
Wahidi is the second militant commander with links to the militant group to be killed in Helmand.
Zamen Ali, a senior Afghan army officer in southern Afghanistan, said that Wahidi took over the anti-government militia Khadim had commanded following his death.
Khadim was a former Taliban commander and Guantanamo detainee who had switched allegiance and aligned his followers with the ISIL group.
But ISIL has never acknowledged having representatives in Afghanistan, and a senior Taliban commander said that Khadim had “not formally joined ISIL and ISIL had not recognized him”.
