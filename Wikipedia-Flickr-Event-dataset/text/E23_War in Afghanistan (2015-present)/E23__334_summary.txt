Taliban kill ten in Afghanistan’s Kunduz: OfficialsAt least ten people were killed and another 18 remain unaccounted for after Taliban militants stopped a number of vehicles on the outskirts of Afghanistan’s northern city of Kunduz, local officials said Tuesday.
"An operation has been launched in the area to rescue the missing passengers," Sapi said.
Last year, Taliban fighters overran Kunduz province and held Kunduz city for three days before being driven out again by Afghan security forces.
At the time, the dramatic -- albeit temporary -- fall of Kunduz to the Taliban sent shockwaves across the war-torn country, prompting fears the group could capture more territory.
The Taliban still have a presence in certain parts of Kunduz and continue to pose a threat to the strategic province, say observers.
