Members of local security forces committed arbitrary, unlawful, and some extrajudicial killings, and officials used torture in jails and prisons.
For example, in September, two Afghan aid workers were shot and killed near Kandahar while working for Voluntary Association for Rehabilitation of Afghanistan, a local NGO which partners with UNHCR.
In August, President Karzai decreed that officials could no longer hold both military and civil posts and removed Ismail Khan from his role as military commander of western Afghanistan.
The BBC, Voice of America, Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Afghanistan were available throughout the country.
During the year, some refugees from Afghanistan voluntary repatriated themselves.
