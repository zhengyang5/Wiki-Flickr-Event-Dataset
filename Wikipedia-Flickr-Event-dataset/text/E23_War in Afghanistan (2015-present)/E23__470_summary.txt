WEST POINT — Six anti-war protesters were arrested outside the U.S. Military Academy during President Barack Obama speech outlining his planned troop buildup in Afghanistan on Tuesday.
The protesters were charged with disorderly conduct for blocking the roadway, Highland Falls Police Chief Peter Miller said.
More than 200 protesters had marched a half mile to a rally at the military academy’s gates before Obama’s speech.
Many said they had voted for Obama and were disappointed with his decision to add 30,000 troops in Afghanistan.
The same old machinery is still grinding away the same old, ugly wars.”
