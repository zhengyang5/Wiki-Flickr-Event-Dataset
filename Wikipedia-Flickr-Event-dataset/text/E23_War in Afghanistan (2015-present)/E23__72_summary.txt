An opposition leader and former defense chief, Ahmed Shah Massoud, was injured and his close aide was killed today in an explosion in northern Afghanistan, an opposition spokesman said.
Mr. Massoud suffered leg injuries, said Mehrab Mastan, his ambassador in Paris.
Mr. Massoud went to Tajikistan after the explosion, Mr. Kahar said.
Mr. Massoud has repeatedly accused the Taliban of using foreign fighters, from Arab countries and neighboring Pakistan, on the battlefield.
From 1992 to 1996, Mr. Massoud served as defense minister in the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was ousted as president when the hard-line Taliban army seized Kabul, Afghanistan's capital.
