The Black Watch started its first deployment to Afghanistan in April British soldiers have launched a major airborne assault on a Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan.
More than 350 troops from the Black Watch were dropped into Babaji, north of Lashkar Gah, Helmand province, just after midnight local time on Friday.
Twelve Chinook helicopters were used in Operation Panther's Claw which involved British and US air forces.
It was backed by more than 150 ground troops from the Black Watch and Royal Engineers using Viking armoured vehicles.
"The MoD says the Black Watch fought off several attacks by insurgents, and secured three main crossing points," said our correspondent.
