KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Afghan army units are corrupt and lack sufficient training and discipline to take over from their American counterparts anytime soon, some U.S. trainers say.
American troops have observed Afghan soldiers cowering in ditches whenever shooting breaks out and say they have seen them routinely stealing U.S.-supplied fuel, equipment and weapons, the military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported Wednesday.
It said some U.S. troops also suspect their Afghan counterparts of collaborating with Taliban insurgents.
There also are concerns about rampant corruption as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, has set a goal of doubling Afghan forces to 400,000 within four years.
