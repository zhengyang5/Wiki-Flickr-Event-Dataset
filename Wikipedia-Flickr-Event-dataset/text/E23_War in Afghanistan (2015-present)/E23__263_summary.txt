Most government officials fled Kunduz early in the day, along with foreign and local NGO workers.
A local reporter who visited the frontline said poor coordination between different government units allowed the Taliban to keep advancing.
He said the attack seemed to be a joint offensive by militants from Kunduz and nearby Baghlan and Takhar provinces.
As in other embattled parts of the country, the Afghan security forces in Kunduz are stretched thin and are mostly fighting without foreign assistance.
As the current fighting illustrates, the government has had problems consolidating its authority in Kunduz since foreign troops pulled out in 2013.
