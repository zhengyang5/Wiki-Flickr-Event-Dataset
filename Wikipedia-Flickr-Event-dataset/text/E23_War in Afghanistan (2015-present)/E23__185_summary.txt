Karzai has sprung a surprise by insisting that peace talks should be "Afghan-led" - meaning, he expects a "hands-on" role for himself.
The hardening of Karzai's stance also needs to be understood against the backdrop of growing restiveness on the part of the erstwhile Northern Alliance groups.
But, most important, they frontally questioned the US's locus standi to initiate peace talks with the Taliban.
Karzai's position becomes precarious if he antagonizes the Northern Alliance groups and turns them hostile.
