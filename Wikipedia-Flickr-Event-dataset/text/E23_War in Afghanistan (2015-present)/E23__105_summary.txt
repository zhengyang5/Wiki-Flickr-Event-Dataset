The Afghan War Diary (AWD for short) consists of messages from several important US military communications systems.
Each unit, outpost, convoy, or other military action generates report about relevant daily events.
It also includes day to day complaints about lack of equipment and supplies.
Once it is in the AWD messages, it is officially part of the record - it is subject to analysis and scrutiny.
The AWD messages are not addressed to individuals but to groups of recipients that are fulfilling certain functions, such as duty officers in a certain region.
