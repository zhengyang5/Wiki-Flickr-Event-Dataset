Members of the Islamic Jihad Union swear allegiance to Taliban emir Mullah Mansour.
The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU), two Central Asian groups that have been allied with al Qaeda in the past, have taken different sides in the ongoing struggle between the Islamic State and al Qaeda for the leadership of the global jihad.
Scores of heavily armed IJU fighters are seen in the photographs.
On Aug. 6, the IMU released a video that featured the groupâ€™s leader, Uthman Ghazi, and numerous IMU fighters swearing allegiance to Baghdadi.
Two such groups are Imam Bukhari Jamaat and Katibat al Tawhid wal Jihad, neither of which has joined the Islamic State.
