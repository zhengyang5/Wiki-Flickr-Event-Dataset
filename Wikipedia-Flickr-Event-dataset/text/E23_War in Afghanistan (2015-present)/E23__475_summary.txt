Thu Apr 19, 7:10 AM ETKABUL (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents are deliberately targeting Afghan civilians in order to instill fear and exert control over the population, the rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday.
In the second report from an international rights group this week accusing the Taliban of war crimes for targeting civilians, the London-based group called on all sides in the Afghan conflict to ensure that civilians are treated humanely.
"Afghan civilians are bearing the brunt of this conflict," Claudio Cordone, the group's senior director for research, said in a statement.
"But it is the Taliban who have a deliberate policy of targeting civilians -- they are killing teachers, abducting aid workers and burning school buildings," he said.
Many Afghan civilians have been killed accidentally in foreign military air strikes since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
