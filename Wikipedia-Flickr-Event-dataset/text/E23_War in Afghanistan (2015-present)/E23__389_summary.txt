ISIS Claims Responsibility For Deadly Attack Aimed At Afghan HazarasEnlarge this image toggle caption Massoud Hossaini/AP Massoud Hossaini/APA suicide bomber attacked a police checkpoint in the Afghan capital Friday, killing at least nine people and wounding 18, officials said.
As NPR's Diaa Hadid reports from Islamabad, "Images from the scene showed men sprawled on the ground.
A spokesman for the Kabul police chief said the bomber was stopped at the checkpoint near the gathering when he detonated explosives.
Over the past two years, a string of attacks on [Shia] mosques and Hazara gatherings have been claimed by an affiliate of Islamic State."
In December, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack that killed dozens of people at a Shia cultural center.
