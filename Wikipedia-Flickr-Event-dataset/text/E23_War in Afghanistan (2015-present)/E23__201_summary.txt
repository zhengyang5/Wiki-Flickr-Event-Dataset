A leaked video showing the pilot of an American helicopter happily singing while a US missile hits an Afghan man is set to further embarrass the United States.
The video, leaked on LiveLeak.com purportedly shows an pilot from the 101st Airborne Division in an AH64 Apache helicopter firing a missile on July 4.
At the moment of impact the pilot can be heard singing Bye Bye Miss American Pie.
Just as he belts out the most famous line of Don McLean's classic song American Pie, the missiles explodes.
In January a video showing soldiers in US uniforms urinating on three Taliban corpses provoked uproar.
