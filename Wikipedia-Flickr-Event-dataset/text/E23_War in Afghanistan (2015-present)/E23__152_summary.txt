KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan’s presidential election was generally fair but not entirely free because of Taliban intimidation and violence that kept turnout low in the south, European monitors said on Saturday.
The election had been “fair generally”, said General Philippe Morillon, chief observer of a European Union election mission, but “free was not the case in some parts of the country due to the terror”.

So far, Western officials have played down the prospect of violence as a result of a contested election.
But he warned that Taliban violence may continue as official results are finalized.
