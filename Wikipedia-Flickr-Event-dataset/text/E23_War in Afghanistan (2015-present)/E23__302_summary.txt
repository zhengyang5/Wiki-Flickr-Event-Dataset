International efforts to help Afghan security forces regain control of territory taken by the Taliban are doing more harm than good, the former president of Afghanistan has warned.
Karzai vehemently opposed US airstrikes and night raids on Afghan villages, which he thinks undermined Afghan sovereignty, along with foreign “interference” in Afghan politics.
But Karzai said those losses should be accepted as the consequence of Afghan forces fighting alone.
Corruption is arguably the biggest ill tormenting Afghanistan, undermining its security forces and spurring public support for the Taliban.
“Nato has been here for 14 years,” he said, adding that foreign forces are fighting for the same districts as they were when they had 150,000 troops.
