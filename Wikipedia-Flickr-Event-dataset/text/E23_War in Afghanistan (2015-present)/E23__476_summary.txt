Lt. Col. Greg Julian, a spokesman for Gen. McKiernan, told The Washington Times that an investigation of last week’s incident showed the Taliban was principally to blame for the civilian deaths.
“This was a deliberate plan by the Taliban to create a civilian casualty crisis,” Col. Julian said.
The removal of Gen. McKiernan marks the fifth time Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has replaced a four-star commander.
Army Gen. George W. Casey, the current Army chief of staff, was moved out as commander of U.S. forces in Iraq in 2007, along with U.S. Central Command commander Gen. John Abizaid.
On Thursday, U.S. officials acknowledged that civilian deaths in Farah province may have been caused by U.S. air strikes.
