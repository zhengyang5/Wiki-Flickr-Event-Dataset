Image caption Footage from a helmet camera was released by the court martial judgeBut Blackman, who will be sentenced on Friday, was convicted by a seven-strong court martial board following a two-week trial.
He described the killing as "totally unforgivable" but said a lenient sentence would be appropriate given the circumstances faced by the Royal Marine.
General Sir Nick Houghton, the head of the Armed Forces, has said very clearly that "murder is murder".
The Judge Advocate General, and a seven-strong military board including Royal Marine and Royal Navy officers, will together decide Blackman's sentence on Friday at Bulford Military Court.
Blackman was 39-years-old at the time of the court martial and had 15 years' experience as a Royal Marine.
