The deployment reportedly includes at least one SAS unit of around 30 soldiers who were operating alongside American special forces and the Afghan National Army.
It marks the first return of British troops to the restive province since last year.
The Wall Street Journal reported that at least three American Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha units, known as A-Teams, have been deployed in the area.
From the start of operations in October 2001, 456 British forces personnel or MoD civilians were killed while serving in Afghanistan.
