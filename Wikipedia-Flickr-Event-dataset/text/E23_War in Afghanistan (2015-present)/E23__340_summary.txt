The U.S. military has launched its first airstrikes against the Taliban in Afghanistan since President Barack Obama's decision earlier this month to expand America's involvement against the insurgents, U.S. officials said Friday.
Officials said the strikes began in the last week and were against Taliban targets in the southern part of the country.
The strikes "are only being used where they may help the Afghans achieve a strategic effect," Cleveland said.
The war in Afghanistan began in 2001, and the U.S. has been conducting a broad range of operations there ever since.
Obama decided in early June to expand America's involvement with more airstrikes against insurgents, giving the U.S. military wider latitude to support Afghan forces, both in the air and on the ground.
