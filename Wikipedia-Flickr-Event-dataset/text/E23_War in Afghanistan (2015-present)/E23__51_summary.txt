CHART: How The U.S. Troop Levels In Afghanistan Have Changed Under ObamaPresident Obama came into office pledging to end the U.S. military role in Afghanistan's war.
Obama withdrew the final American combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, when that country was relatively stable.
But the Iraqi fighting resumed as the Islamic State emerged as a potent force, and Obama sent American forces back into Iraq.
As a U.S. trainer recently told NPR's Tom Bowman, Afghan forces would struggle if the U.S. left.
"It wasn't clear how much progress the Afghan forces would make, and some of the estimates were far too optimistic," he said.
