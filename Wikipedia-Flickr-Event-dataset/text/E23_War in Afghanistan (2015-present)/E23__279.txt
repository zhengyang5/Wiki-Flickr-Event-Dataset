Taliban-on-Taliban turf war erupts in Afghanistan

World Bulletin / News Desk

Fighting for territory between the Taliban and a pro-ISIL Taliban splinter group in southern Afghanistan has claimed over 100 lives over the past five days, local security officials say.

According to security officials in Afghanistan’s Zabul province, the fighting -- some of which has involved heavy weaponry -- has raged since Friday, when supporters of Mullah Mansoor Dadullah clashed with fighters loyal to Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor.

Mansoor is said to have had the upper hand in the fight, even though Dadullah enjoys the support of pro-ISIL militants, including many ethnic Uzbeks and Chechens.

According to Ghulam Jilani Farahi, provincial director of security in Zabul, more than 100 militants from both sides have been killed since the fighting broke out on Friday.

Farahi told Anadolu Agency that the turf war first erupted in Zabul’s Arghandab district but had since spread to other districts as well.

Members of Zabul’s local provincial council have since confirmed the reports.

Abdul Aziz Ikrami, spokesman for the Independent Human Rights Commission in the southern zone, said the fighting had led to concerns over the already fragile state of security in the country’s restive south.

"In such situations, civilian populations often find themselves caught in the middle," he said.

For the last several years, a number of districts in Zabul have remained under the Taliban’s influence.

The recent fighting, however, is the first time for rival Taliban factions to wage war on one another, although a similar situation can now be seen in the eastern Nangarhar province on the border with Pakistan.
