Mansour and Siraj Haqqani are both allied with al Qaeda.
Mansour recently described al Qaeda’s leaders as the “heroes of the current jihadist era.”Siraj’s dossier is filled with ties to al Qaeda.
Baghdadi has explicitly made this claim, which has been rejected by both the Taliban and al Qaeda.
Mansour counted a radical Saudi cleric who supported al Qaeda as one of the Taliban’s chief ideological boosters.
Both he and his father are ideologues who worked with Sheikh Issa al Masri, an influential al Qaeda thinker who helped radicalize thousands of jihadists by indoctrinating them with al Qaeda’s version of Islam.
