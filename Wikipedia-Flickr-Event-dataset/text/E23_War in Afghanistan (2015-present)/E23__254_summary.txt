Afghan security forces managed to repel the attack, killing all seven gunmen and ensuring that no members of parliament were harmed.
Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said the attack began with a car bomb explosion near the entrance to parliament.
Health Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ismail Kahousi said 31 civilians were wounded in the parliament attack, including two women and two children.
He said the assault showed the "capability of the mujahedeen, who can even attack the parliament in the capital."
The attack on parliament came hours after the Taliban seized a second district in the northern Kunduz province, which has borne the brunt of their annual warm-weather offensive.
