Mullah Najibullah, a 22-year-old Taliban subcommander in the north, was determined to keep fighting despite the odds.
However, as he drove into the capital one night in a Land Cruiser full of fighters, Najibullah got caught in a heavy firefight at a checkpoint.
Indeed, Najibullah, whose nom de guerre is Umar Khatab, has broken away completely from the shura leadership.
“Najibullah has always been aggressive and often has broken Taliban rules,” says the former Taliban intelligence officer.
“Najibullah is gradually becoming a serious headache for the shura,” says a former Taliban senior minister.
