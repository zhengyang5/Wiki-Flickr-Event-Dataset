The war in Afghanistan has cost Britain at least £37bn and the figure will rise to a sum equivalent to more than £2,000 for every taxpaying household, according to a devastating critique of the UK's role in the conflict.
Since 2006, on a conservative estimate, it has cost £15m a day to maintain Britain's military presence in Helmand province.
The MoD has estimated the cost so far of conducting military operations in Afghanistan to be about £25bn.
MoD officials said on Wednesday that British troops were in Helmand to protect British national security by helping Afghans build up their own security forces.
Much of British aid to Afghanistan is spent on consultancy fees rather than those Afghans who need it most.
