Obama's war: Deploying 17,000 raises stakes in Afghanistan WASHINGTON Â— Barack Obama, whose presidential ambitions were launched by his opposition to one war, moved Tuesday to expand the U.S. deployment in another.
In his first such action as president, Obama ordered an additional 17,000 combat troops to Afghanistan.
For the new president, Afghanistan looms as a defining military conflict.
Even with Obama's planned deployment, three times more U.S. troops will be on duty in Iraq than in Afghanistan.
The Iraq war "diverted huge amounts of resources from Afghanistan and Pakistan," says Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who is on the Armed Services Committee.
