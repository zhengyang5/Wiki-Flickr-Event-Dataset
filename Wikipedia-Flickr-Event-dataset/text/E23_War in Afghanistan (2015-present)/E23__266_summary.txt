Taliban seizes control of major Afghan city Kunduz for first time since US-led invasionUpdatedTaliban fighters have seized a major Afghan city for the first time since being ousted from power by the US-led invasion in 2001, storming government compounds and sending panicked residents fleeing.
Many were fleeing to the city's main airport, which is still in government control, but some complained they were being turned away by security forces.
He confirmed "most of Kunduz city has fallen to the Taliban", and said Afghan forces were regrouping at the airport.
Afghanistan's deputy chief of army staff Murad Ali Murad defended the Afghan security forces' performance, suggesting they withdrew to avoid harming civilians with all-out urban warfare.
"There were enough troops inside Kunduz city, but the insurgents used some route deemed not that sensitive," Mr Murad told a news briefing.
