Gen Sir Nick Houghton said it would be "quite wrong" for the armed forces to expect special provision from the law.
He said the armed forces expected "immaculate standards" from its servicemen and women and the Army had to be "immaculate" in upholding judicial process.
"These are standards that are core to our values as a society and core to the values of the British armed forces," he said.
The Afghan insurgent had been seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, and the marines found him in a field.
