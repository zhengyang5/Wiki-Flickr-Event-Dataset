Five men arrested in Afghanistan over involvement in Pakistan school massacre

Updated

Five men accused of involvement in a massacre at a school in Pakistan last month have been arrested in Afghanistan.

The arrests came amid a thawing of relations between the two governments, with both countries promising stronger cross-border cooperation.

Afghan president Ashraf Ghani made a successful trip to Pakistan soon after coming into office last October.

Security officials said the men had not been handed over to Pakistan yet and would first be questioned by Afghan authorities.

The men were caught after Pakistan supplied information to the government in Kabul.

It is believed the men were not the main attackers but were more indirectly involved in the massacre.

Most of the 149 people killed by Taliban gunmen at the Peshawar school were children, sparking global outrage.

The Taliban said the attack was in response to a government offensive in North Waziristan that began last year.

Earlier this month the Pakistani Taliban leader Mullah Fazlullah released a video vowing more attacks on children.

The government and the military said Pakistan's Taliban insurgency amounted to a war.
