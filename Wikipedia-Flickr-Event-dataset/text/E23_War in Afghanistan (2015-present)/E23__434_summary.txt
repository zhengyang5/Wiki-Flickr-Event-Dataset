1 of 1 2 of 1Canada's scheduled 2011 pullout from Afghanistan can't come soon enough for Malalai Joya.
In an interview with the Straight, the women's-rights activist and the country's youngest member of parliament said she wants all NATO forces out of Afghanistan tomorrow.
In the book, Joya recounts tales of her childhood and her entry into social work and activism.
Pressed on what she thinks would happen if NATO did withdraw its troops tomorrow, Joya argued that even if the country plunged into deeper violence, the Afghan people would be rid of at least one adversary.
But, she cautioned, there is much that western powers must do before they regain the trust of the Afghan people.
