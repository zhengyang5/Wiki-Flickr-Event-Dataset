A shcoking report on Kabul under the Taliban.



My God why is Kabul being destroyed? sings a boy in Afghanistan. A young girls lies in hospital screaming. Her amputated leg hangs in the air. The people of Kabul are bitter, besieged on all fronts by the Taliban army. Women haggle over sacks of airlifted food. Their only hope of survival is Defence Minister, Ahmad Shah Massoud. Known to his enemies as the 'Lion of Panjshir', he is frantically driving across the snow topped desert to brief his Commanders. A freezing winter has halted the Taliban advance. In the respite, he tables a meeting to re-structure his army. We are granted a rare interview with Massoud as he talks of human rights, democracy and rights for women. We also have secret footage of Taliban leaders as they recommend amputation as punishment for stealing. In Kabul's hospital we talk to the victims who have been hit by Taliban rockets. They lie in ramshackle wards with little or no facilities. The Red Cross estimates that a million people are starving to death. Having funded the Mujahadeen in its fight against the Soviet Union, the West has lost interest. Massoud is alone in attempting to defend his city against Islamic fundamentalists.
