WEST POINT — Six anti-war protesters were arrested outside the U.S. Military Academy during President Barack Obama speech outlining his planned troop buildup in Afghanistan on Tuesday.

The protesters were charged with disorderly conduct for blocking the roadway, Highland Falls Police Chief Peter Miller said.

More than 200 protesters had marched a half mile to a rally at the military academy’s gates before Obama’s speech. They carried candles and protest signs saying “The audacity of torture,” “Get out now,” and “How many lives per gallon?”

The group included people of all ages, from young children to seniors hobbling with canes, as well as war veterans and family members with loved ones fighting overseas. Many said they had voted for Obama and were disappointed with his decision to add 30,000 troops in Afghanistan.

They carried signs saying “The audacity of torture,” “Get out now,” and “Barack, ’change we can believe in’ is a lie!”

One protester, carrying a large cardboard cutout of a bomb, wore an American flag as a cape and a mask of President Bush breaking through a mask of Obama.

Bennett Weiss, 60, of Newburgh, said, “I’m extremely concerned. Although we have a new president, we don’t have a new policy. The same old machinery is still grinding away the same old, ugly wars.”
