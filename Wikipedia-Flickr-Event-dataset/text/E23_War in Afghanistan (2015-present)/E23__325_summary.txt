KUNAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Dozens of fighters loyal to Islamic State in Afghanistan have relocated into the eastern province of Kunar following an intense campaign by U.S. warplanes and Afghan forces, officials said Thursday.
Local Islamic State leader Hafiz Saeed is believed to be among those who fled to Kunar from neighbouring Nangarhar province, Kunar’s police chief and an army spokesman said.
Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL, or Daesh, is a relatively new force in Afghanistan and has violently challenged the much larger Afghan Taliban movement in pockets of the country’s east.
The Islamist group numbers some 1,000 to 3,000 members in Afghanistan, a U.S. military spokesman said in February.
Fighters joining Islamic State are typically former members of the Afghan Taliban or the separate Pakistani Taliban.
