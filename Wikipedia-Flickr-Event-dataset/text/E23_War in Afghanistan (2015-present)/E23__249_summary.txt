Kabul's deputy police chief, Sayed Gul Agha Rouhani, told reporters that a suicide bomber had driven a vehicle into the first checkpoint on the road into the airport.
"The last few days have shown that suicide bomber training camps and bomb-producing factories which are killing our people are as active as before in Pakistan," Mr Ghani said.
A suicide bomber blew himself up near the city's police academy on Friday evening, killing about 20 recruits.
A short while later, gunmen launched an attack on Camp Integrity, a Nato base that houses US special forces near the airport.
