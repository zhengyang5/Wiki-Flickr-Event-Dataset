Mr. Obama and Mr. Karzai appeared to appreciate the candor of the exchanges, officials said.
Mr. Obama extolled what he said was the progress made by Afghan security forces.
But with negotiations at a standstill, Mr. Obama left little doubt that the Afghans would take the lead in any bargaining.
“The United States has been very clear that any peace process, any reconciliation process, must be Afghan-led,” he said.
He said the United States would speak up for the rights of Afghan women — rights that he noted were enshrined in the Afghan Constitution.
