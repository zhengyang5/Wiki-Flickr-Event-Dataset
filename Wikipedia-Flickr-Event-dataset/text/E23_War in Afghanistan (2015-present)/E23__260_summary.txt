The district not only adjoins Kunduz city, but its administrative center is also only about two and a half miles from the city’s outskirts.
“If the government does not send enough reinforcements, the city of Kunduz will fall to the Taliban,” the official said.
Kunduz Province is heavily populated, with a million residents, while Badakhshan is remote and sparsely populated, but with lucrative mineral resources.
Many local Kunduz residents also posted photos and videos on social media sites showing people fleeing Chahar Dara District for nearby Kunduz city.
Gen. Dawlat Waziri, confirmed both that Yamgan District had been retaken from the insurgents, and that Chahar Dara District had fallen to them.
