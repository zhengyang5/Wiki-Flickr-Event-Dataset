Documentary (composite video production) about the life of Ahmad Shah Massoud.
[Part 5: Armed Resistance and Europe]Ahmad Shah Massoud became known as the "Lion of Panjshir" during the Soviet war in Afghanistan leading resistance fighters in north-eastern Afghanistan.
After the fall of the communist regime in Afghanistan, Massoud became minister of defense of the Islamic State of Afghanistan under the Peshawar Accords.
The National Geographic ultimately concluded: "The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud."
In early 2001, on a visit to Europe, Massoud warned about an unspecified attack on U.S. soil being imminent.
