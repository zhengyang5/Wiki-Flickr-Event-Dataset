Passaro was working for the CIA as part of a paramilitary team hunting terrorists near the Pakistan border.
RALEIGH -- Former CIA contractor David Passaro, the only person associated with the agency to be prosecuted for prisoner abuse, was sentenced Tuesday to eight years, four months in prison for beating an Afghan detainee who later died.
The bigger pictureHuman rights observers said Justice Department officials have not done enough to prosecute those responsible for prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan.
A half-dozen 82nd Airborne soldiers told jurors about the beatings, which they observed while guarding Wali's cell or assisting Passaro.
On Tuesday, prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle to sentence Passaro to 11 1/2 years in prison, but he could have faced as little as 15 months in prison.
