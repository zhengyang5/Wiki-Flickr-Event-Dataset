All out for the March 20th March on Washington!
People from all over the country are organizing to converge on Washington, D.C., to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all U.S. and NATO forces from Afghanistan and Iraq.
On Saturday, March 20, 2010, there will be a massive National March & Rally in D.C. A day of action and outreach in Washington, D.C., will take place on Friday, March 19, preceding the Saturday march.
March 20 is the seventh anniversary of the criminal war of aggression launched by Bush and Cheney against Iraq.
The slogans on banners may differ, but all those who carry them should be marching shoulder to shoulder.
