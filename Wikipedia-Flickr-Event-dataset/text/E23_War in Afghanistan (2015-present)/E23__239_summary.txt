Five men arrested in Afghanistan over involvement in Pakistan school massacreUpdatedFive men accused of involvement in a massacre at a school in Pakistan last month have been arrested in Afghanistan.
Security officials said the men had not been handed over to Pakistan yet and would first be questioned by Afghan authorities.
The men were caught after Pakistan supplied information to the government in Kabul.
It is believed the men were not the main attackers but were more indirectly involved in the massacre.
