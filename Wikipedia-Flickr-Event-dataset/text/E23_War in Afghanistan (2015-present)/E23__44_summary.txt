President George Bush and Tony Blair yesterday warned the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in the starkest terms that preparations for the war against them were complete and attacks could be launched at any time.
Bush's comments were echoed by Tony Blair, who was even more outspoken in suggesting that an outbreak of hostilities was imminent.
Blair stressed his determination to see the removal of the Taliban regime from power and added that the priority was now to work towards replacing it.
Blair made clear, however, that any military action would have a tight focus and ruled out attacks on other states accused of supporting terrorism.
'Before the events in New York, the Taliban were ready and very, very seriously preparing for a new round of internal war,' said a senior Northern Alliance officer.
