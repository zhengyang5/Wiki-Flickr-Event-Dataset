The new solution follows a long period of negotiations, which also involved lawyers who claimed to be representing the victims.
The Defense Ministry contacted Christoph Reuter, a reporter for the German newsmagazine Stern who had painstakingly researched the number of civilians killed.
The Defense Ministry is now hoping that the case will be closed once and for all.
The victims' lawyers, however, have reacted to the Bundeswehr's action with surprise and annoyance.
On Tuesday, before the announcement of the compensation, the victims' lawyers had already made an appointment with the Defense Ministry to discuss the issue.
