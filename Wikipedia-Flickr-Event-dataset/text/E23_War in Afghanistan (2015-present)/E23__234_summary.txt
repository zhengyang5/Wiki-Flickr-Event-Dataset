LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth joined army top brass and relatives of British soldiers who died in Afghanistan at a commemoration service at St Paulâ€™s Cathedral in London on Friday, marking the end of 13 years of British military operations in the country.
Britain lost 453 servicemen and women in Afghanistan out of the 140,000 who served there over the years.
The last combat troops left in October last year, leaving behind only about 500 trainers and advisers assisting the Afghan security forces.
Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip arrive for the Afghanistan service of commemoration at St Paul's Cathedral in London March 13, 2015.
David Coulter, a chaplain who spent time at Camp Bastion during the war, recalled memorial services that took place there before the cross, which was made by a group of soldiers.
