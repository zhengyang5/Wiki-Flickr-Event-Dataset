Civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2016 were the highest recorded by the United Nations, the world body said, with nearly 11,500 non-combatants - one-third of them children - killed or wounded.
Fighting between Afghan security forces and armed groups, especially in populated areas, remained "the leading cause of civilian casualties" more than two years after NATO's combat mission ended, said the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which began documenting civilian casualties in 2009.
Last year saw the highest number of civilian casualties from suicide attacks since the UN began tracking the numbers.
'I ndiscriminate use of heavy weapons'Afghan security forces caused about 20 percent of the overall casualties, while pro-government fighters and international forces caused two percent each.
US officials have only acknowledged possible civilian casualties in one incident in Kunduz province in November, when the UN said as many as 32 non-combatants were killed and 26 wounded in a joint US-Afghan raid.
