The New Year marked the official end of NATO combat operations in Afghanistan, and means some 350,000 Afghan forces will now be responsible for fighting a Taliban insurgency that has become increasingly organized in carrying out attacks.
Afghanistan experienced a surge in violence in the leadup to the withdrawal of NATO troops.
The bulk of those casualties were killed in Taliban attacks or during ground battles between insurgents and Afghan forces.
