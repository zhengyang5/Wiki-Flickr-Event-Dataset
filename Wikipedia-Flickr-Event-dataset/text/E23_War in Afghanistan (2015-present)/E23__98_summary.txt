Defence Policy and BusinessApproximately 1,400 additional UK troops are to deploy to southern Afghanistan at NATO's request, Defence Secretary Des Browne announced today, 26 February 2007.
UK troops and other ISAF forces have taken the fight to the Taliban in southern Afghanistan over the winter months, and have tactically defeated them again and again.
What military forces can do, as has been shown right across the country, is increase security.
Mr Speaker, this is why we have decided to commit additional forces to Afghanistan.
These additional forces will meet NATOâ€™s requirement for troops who can work across the region, in Kandahar and elsewhere.
