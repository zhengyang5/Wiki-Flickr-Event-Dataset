THE leader of the Afghan resistance , Ahmad Shah Massoud, was reported to have been killed or seriously wounded yesterday in a grave setback to hopes of toppling the extremist Islamic Taliban regime.
Judged a brilliant guerrilla commander by his former Russian foes, Gen Massoud had long carried the West's hopes in Afghanistan.
Gen Massoud was giving an interview at his base in the Panjshir Valley to two Arabs posing as journalists when a bomb went off.
Front commanders and Western diplomats in central Asia said Gen Massoud was treated for serious head injuries by Russian army surgeons in Tajikistan, where he was flown after the blast.
Gen Massoud's guards shot dead the other bomber.
