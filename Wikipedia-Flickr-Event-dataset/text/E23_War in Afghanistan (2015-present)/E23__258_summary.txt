Afghan militias stand near a frontline during a battle at the Chardara district of Kunduz province, May 3, 2015.
Ghani’s spokesman, Ajmal Abidy, denied that the Kunduz recruitment amounted to re-arming mujahideen militias.
Human rights groups have documented abuses both by “uprising” units and mujahideen militias.
“A large number of them (mujahideen militias) were unhappy with the government, so we tried to bring them into an organized framework,” Safi said.
For militia fighters in Kunduz, the call to arms feels overdue; prominent mujahideen commanders have felt sidelined by Ghani’s government.
