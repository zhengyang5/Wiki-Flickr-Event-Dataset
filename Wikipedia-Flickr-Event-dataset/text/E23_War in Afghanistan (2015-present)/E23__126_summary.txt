U.S. defense chiefs visited Afghanistan and Pakistan on Tuesday amid growing fears of a rising Taliban insurgency, and anger in Pakistan over cross-border raids.
In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said Pakistan would "correct the record" on the latest statement.
Abbas said that Pakistan's military had asked for an explanation but received only a "half-page" of "very vague" information that failed to identify the intended target.
Abbas did not say when exactly the orders for Pakistani troops to open fire to prevent cross-border raids by U.S. troops were issued.
The top U.S. military officer, Adm. Mike Mullen, landed in Pakistan to meet Kayani and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani.
