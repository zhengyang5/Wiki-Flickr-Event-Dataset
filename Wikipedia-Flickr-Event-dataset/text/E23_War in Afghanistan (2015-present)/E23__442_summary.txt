SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.
In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.
Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.
Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.
That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away.
