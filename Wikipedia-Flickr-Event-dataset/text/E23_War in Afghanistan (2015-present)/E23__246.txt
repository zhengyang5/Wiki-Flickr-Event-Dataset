FORT DRUM, N.Y. (AP) -- More than 1,600 soldiers in the 10th Mountain Division will be heading to Afghanistan this year to serve as advisers to Afghan security forces and protect other U.S. troops on military bases.

Officials at Fort Drum in northern New York say about 1,660 members of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team will deploy in the spring and summer to southern Afghanistan as part of Resolute Support Mission. It will be the brigade's fourth deployment to Afghanistan. It's last deployment ended in October 2013.

The brigade recently finished a monthlong training exercise at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana, home to one of the 10th Mountain Division's three brigade combat teams.
