The US military has not released a casualty toll and declined to comment on the Afghan numbers.
After the bombing, US and Afghan forces conducted clearing operations and airstrikes in the area and assessed the damage.
The bombing followed an extensive US campaign, waged for more than a year, to rid eastern Afghanistan of militants who have sworn loyalty to Isis.
The spike was largely a result of increased military efforts in the east, where Isis groups are based.
The GBU-43/B or Moab, known as the “mother of all bombs”, is the largest non-nuclear bomb the US has deployed in war.
