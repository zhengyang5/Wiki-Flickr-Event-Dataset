The Taliban are once again close to capturing Sangin, a crucial district in Helmand where more than 100 British soldiers lost their lives.
Local commanders say most of the district has fallen and the government is left in control of only a few miles around Sangin City.

Meanwhile, Afghanistan announced it expected to hold direct talks with the Taliban by the end of this month.
The last direct talks between Kabul and the Taliban broke down after just one session last summer when Kabul announced that the Taliban's reclusive, long-time leader Mullah Mohammad Omar died two years earlier.
