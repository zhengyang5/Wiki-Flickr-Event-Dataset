There are almost 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan. They comprise the largest protracted refugee population in Asia, and the second largest refugee population in the world. In light of the increasingly deteriorating security situation in many parts of the country, the violence continues to drive people from their homes in 2018.

UNHCR's work in the country includes coordinating with the authorities to ensure returns to Afghanistan takes place in voluntary, safe, gradual and dignified manner, and that displaced people are protected. We also lead on two inter-agency groups, one on protection and response to internally displaced people, and the other on emergency shelter and non-food items, providing core relief items and emergency shelter assistance to vulnerable displaced people.
