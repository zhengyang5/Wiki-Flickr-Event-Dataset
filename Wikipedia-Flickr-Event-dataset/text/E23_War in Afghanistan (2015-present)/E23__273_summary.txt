It also cast doubt on the sincerity of recent gestures made by the Taliban, which suggested that they would be open to restarting peace talks to end the countryâ€™s insurgency.
On Monday seven members of the Taliban attacked the parliament in Kabul with a suicide car bomb, rockets and assault rifles.
Everyone knew that the parliament would present a prime target for the insurgents, and so their success in getting past the gates to fire rockets directly at the building was remarkable.
Delegates from both sides stress that they act in personal capacity, though the high profile of some of them has spurred hope that peace talks could be on the horizon.
Whatever the logic on the Taliban side, peace talks are unlikely to get anywhere until this spate of violence subsides.
