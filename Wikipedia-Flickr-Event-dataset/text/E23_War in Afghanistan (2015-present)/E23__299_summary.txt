Gen. Abdul Rahman Sarjang, the provincial police chief, confirmed the capture of the district government facility, but said Afghan forces were able to fall back with light casualties and would soon retake the district.
“The Taliban only attack outposts and overrun them, and we are retaking those posts from them, so it does not mean they are dominating Helmand,” General Sarjang said.
General Sarjang, however, disputed the extent of the insurgents’ control in Helmand.
“The Taliban do not control half of Helmand, and we will not let them control it,” he said.
But the Afghan forces responded to the threats.”There are about 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan, along with about 3,000 troops from coalition partners, mostly NATO countries.
