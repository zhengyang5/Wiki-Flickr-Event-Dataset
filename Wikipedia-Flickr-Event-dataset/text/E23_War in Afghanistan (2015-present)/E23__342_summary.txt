Two bombs hit a convoy of buses carrying graduates from a ceremony on the city's western outskirts.
Paghman District Governor Musa Khan told the BBC that all but two of the dead were police cadets.
The bombing was claimed by the Taliban and follows an attack on a bus just over a week ago that killed 14 people.
The cadets were returning to Kabul from a training centre in Wardak province and were about to go on leave.
Taliban violence normally increases at this time of year, but this year there is an unusual upsurge in several provinces.
