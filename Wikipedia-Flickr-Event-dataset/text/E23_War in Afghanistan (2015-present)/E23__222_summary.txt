A Lancer was involved in a friendly fire airstrike that killed five U.S. troops and an Afghan soldier in June.
A B-1B Lancer bomber dropped its ordnance on five U.S. soldiers, including members of an elite Special Forces team.
McDonald and Studenmund were Special Operations troops with the 5th Special Forces Group of Fort Campbell, Ky., while Helton was a bomb technician and Clouse and Toppen were infantrymen.
This photograph shows the area of Afghanistan where five U.S. troops and an Afghan soldier were killed in a friendly fire airstrike by a B-1B bomber on June 9, 2014.
Troops on the ground directing the airstrike repeatedly told the B-1B crew that all friendly troops were 300 meters away from the ridgeline about to be targeted.
