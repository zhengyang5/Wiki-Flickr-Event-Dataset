KUNDUZ, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents killed nine people and kidnapped 20 others when they held up three buses in northern Afghanistan on Tuesday, while the remaining 140 passengers had to be rescued by Afghan forces, the local deputy police chief said.
“The Taliban have brutally killed nine civilians and taken about 20 with them,” Hashemi said.
Afghan forces then rescued the remaining 140 passengers, he said.
The Taliban, who are waging a bloody insurgency to topple the foreign-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani, said they killed six and took 20 members of the Afghan security forces with them.
The brief capture by the Taliban of Kunduz last year was a major blow to Ghani’s government.
