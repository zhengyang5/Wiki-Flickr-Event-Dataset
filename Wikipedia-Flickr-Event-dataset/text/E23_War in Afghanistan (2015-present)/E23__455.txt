US PUBLIC support for the war in Afghanistan has reached a record low, overshadowing a major review that has revealed modest progress in the conflict.

Sixty per cent of Americans now say the war has not been ''worth fighting'', with 43 per cent ''strongly'' of that opinion.

The opposition has grown in recent months, despite a big fall in the number of US and allied casualties from mid-year peaks recorded at the height of the US troop surge.

While the increasingly negative assessment spells political danger for President Barack Obama, most have welcomed his pledge to start withdrawing troops by the middle of next year, a plan that the review concluded remained on track.

However, the assessment cited Afghanistan governance and the ability of Taliban fighters to retreat to ''safe havens'' within neighbouring Pakistan as continuing challenges.
