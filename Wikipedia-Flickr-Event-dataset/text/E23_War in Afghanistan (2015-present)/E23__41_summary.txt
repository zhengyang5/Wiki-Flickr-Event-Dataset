After more than 13 years and the death of around 3,500 foreign troops, including 2,224 American soldiers, the United States and NATO officially ended the war in Afghanistan on Sunday.
It was a symbolic event that marked how Afghan forces will now be charged with battling the escalating Taliban insurgency.
It marks a sharp drawdown from a peak of 140,000 troops seen in 2010, when President Obama ordered a surge.
A small audience at the headquarters of the NATO mission saw how the green-and-white flag of the ISAF was replaced with another one that was nearly identical for the Resolute Support mission.
Mission “Resolute Support will serve as the bedrock of an enduring partnership” between NATO and the country, he added.
