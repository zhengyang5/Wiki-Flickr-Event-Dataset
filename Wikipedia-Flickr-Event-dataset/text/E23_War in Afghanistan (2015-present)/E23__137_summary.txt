What they say, embedded in this report by McChrystal, is they would need 500,000 troops - boots on the ground - and five years to do the job.
It was not revealed in the redacted version of the once classified report released by the Pentagon earlier this week.
McChrystal has warned the administration that without an infusion of more troops the eight-year war in Afghanistan "will likely result in failure."
Thankfully, President Obama is re-thinking his Afghanistan strategy from top to bottom in light of McChrystal's report.
Congress should immediately convene hearings to discuss alternatives to General McChrystal's proposal for such a massive escalation of the war in Afghanistan.
