PUBLIC opinion has soured against the war in Afghanistan, with a new poll showing most Australians now oppose the troop deployment.
And in worrying signs for the Federal Government  which argued that Australia needed to pull out of the unpopular Iraq war and focus on Afghanistan  only half the country is confident Australia has clear aims in the conflict.
The survey, released yesterday by the Lowy Institute for International Policy, suggests mixed views on the reasons driving Australia's almost seven-year military commitment.
In a 10-point jump on 2007 figures, 56% of Australians are now opposed to continued military involvement.
"That's a clear shift from last year and it looks to me like a process of Australians shifting their attitudes on Iraq to Afghanistan," said Lowy Institute executive director Allan Gyngell.
