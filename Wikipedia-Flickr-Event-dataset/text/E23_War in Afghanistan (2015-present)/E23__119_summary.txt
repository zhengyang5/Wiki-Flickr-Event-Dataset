The South Waziristan raid would be the first ever ground assault into Pakistan by foreign forces from Afghanistan.
Pakistan says the raid was a violation of its sovereignty.
On Thursday a US missile killed at least five people in nearby North Waziristan, officials say.
Some officials say as many as 20 people died.
Senior government officials say he was not in the car at the time.
