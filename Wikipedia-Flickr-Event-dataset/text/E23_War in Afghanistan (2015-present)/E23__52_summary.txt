All of that also presumes that Mr. Baradar is ready to give up the fight.
Of the 33 Afghan Taliban prisoners who have been set free by Pakistan this year, several are thought to have returned directly to the battlefield.
In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Aziz said Mr. Baradar could be released as early as this month.
But Mr. Faizi, the Afghan presidential spokesman, expressed a cautious acceptance that Mr. Baradar might be kept in Pakistan.
American and Pakistani officials initially said they had not been targeting Mr. Baradar when they carried out the raid.
