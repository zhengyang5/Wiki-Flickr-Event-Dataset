7 years agoWashington (CNN) - American support for the war in Afghanistan has never been lower, according to the latest CNN polling.
The low numbers just the latest figure in the complex math being calculated to determine how the US should proceed in the ten year war.
The latest poll from CNN and Opinion Research Corporation found only 37% of all Americans favor the war, 52% say the war in Afghanistan has turned into a Vietnam.
Those numbers are going down as US commitment to the war is going up, significantly.
The numbers right now suggest that the surge in troops has, not surprisingly, led to a surge in offensives.
