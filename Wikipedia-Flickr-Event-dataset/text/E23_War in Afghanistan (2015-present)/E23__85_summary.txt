Of the 2,000 coalition troops involved, about half are Afghan forces whose primary mission is to block al Qaeda and Taliban forces from leaving the area, Franks said.
Franks estimated the number of dead al Qaeda and Taliban fighters at between 100 and 200.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said at an earlier Pentagon briefing that the Taliban and al Qaeda forces were "determined, they're dangerous, they will not give up without a fight.
But Rumsfeld pointed out that it is easy for the al Qaeda and Taliban to blend into the countryside and villages to regroup, partly because of the Afghan terrain.
