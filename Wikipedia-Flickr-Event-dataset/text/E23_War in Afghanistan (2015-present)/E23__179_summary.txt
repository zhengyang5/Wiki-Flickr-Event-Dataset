David Cameron has already said 450 personnel will leave this summer of a force that varies from 9,500 to 11,000.
Cameron will have been briefed about the current security situation in Helmand, which is confused.
Last year in May British troops had "contact" with insurgent fighters 160 times in four weeks (15 in the first week of May, 30 in the second, 50 in the third and 65 in the fourth).
The armed forces minister, Nick Harvey, said it was "presumptuous" to assume the UK would take its lead from the US.
Britain will make up its own mind about troop withdrawal based on the conditions on the ground, he insisted.
