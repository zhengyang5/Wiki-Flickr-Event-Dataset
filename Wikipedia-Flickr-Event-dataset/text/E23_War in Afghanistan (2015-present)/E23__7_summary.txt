Today America is fighting a Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan operating from a safe haven in Pakistan.
President Barack Obama said this again in his speech outlining his new policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan on March 27th 2009.
The Taliban insurgency is very much restricted to the Pashtun community.
Today, Pakistan is the safe haven of the Taliban insurgency and its logistical supply line.
There is no inherent reason for the NATO war in Afghanistan to follow the pattern of the Soviet war.
