An opposition leader and former defense chief, Ahmed Shah Massoud, was injured and his close aide was killed today in an explosion in northern Afghanistan, an opposition spokesman said.

Two men from Algeria posing as journalists are suspected of hiding the explosive device in their camera, the spokesman, Hajji Kahar, said in a satellite telephone interview from Khodja Bahauddin in northern Takhar province, where the explosion occurred.

Mr. Massoud suffered leg injuries, said Mehrab Mastan, his ambassador in Paris. One of his spokesmen, Azim Suhail, was killed. Mr. Massoud went to Tajikistan after the explosion, Mr. Kahar said.

Mr. Massoud has repeatedly accused the Taliban of using foreign fighters, from Arab countries and neighboring Pakistan, on the battlefield. The Taliban deny the charge.

There was no immediate comment on the explosion from the Taliban, who rule most of Afghanistan and are trying to defeat Mr. Massoud's forces in the northern parts of the country. He heads an alliance of several small parties, largely formed along ethnic lines.

From 1992 to 1996, Mr. Massoud served as defense minister in the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was ousted as president when the hard-line Taliban army seized Kabul, Afghanistan's capital.
