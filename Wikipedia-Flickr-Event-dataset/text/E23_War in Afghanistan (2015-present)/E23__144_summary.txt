The Obama administration has made turning the war around a top priority, and the Helmand operation, if it succeeds, is seen as a potentially critical first step.
Officers here said the mission, which required months of planning, is the Marines' largest operation since the 2004 invasion of Fallujah, Iraq.
An initial priority for the Marines will be to bring back Afghan government officials and reinvigorate the local police forces.
"Our focus is not the Taliban," Nicholson told his officers.
The Marines have also been vexed by a lack of Afghan security forces and a near-total absence of additional U.S. civilian reconstruction personnel.
