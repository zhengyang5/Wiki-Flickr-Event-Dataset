This weekend Washington is abuzz about one thing alone — health care.
“Now, I have long been a vigorous defender of free markets,” Mr. Obama said, praising the bill.
In the Pipe: The White House is so focused on what happens after the health care bill passes that they’ve prepared a public relations campaign to reshape soured attitudes about the bill.
From the GOP: In the Republicans’ weekly address, House Minority Leader John Boehner does indeed talk about health care.
For example, Mr. Obama has not once mentioned that last month troops marching into the Marja region of Afghanistan opened the largest military operation of his presidency.
