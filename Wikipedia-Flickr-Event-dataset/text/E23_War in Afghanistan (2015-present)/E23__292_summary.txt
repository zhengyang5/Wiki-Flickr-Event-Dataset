Some 12,000 foreign soldiers are deployed as part of the Nato-led Resolute Support international coalition, which is meant to underpin Afghanistan's own security forces.
Fierce gun battles were going on between the Taliban and the Afghan security forces, Mr Rahimi was quoted as saying on Afghan TV, and the government had sent back-up forces.
Quoted separately by the Associated Press, Mr Rasulyar said casualties among Afghan security forces were high, without giving figures.
Sangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade.
