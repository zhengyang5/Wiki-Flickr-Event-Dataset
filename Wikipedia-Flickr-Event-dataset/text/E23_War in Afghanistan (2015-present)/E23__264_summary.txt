Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi later confirmed that “most of Kunduz city has fallen to the Taliban,” and said Afghan forces were regrouping at the airport.
“There were enough troops inside Kunduz city, but the insurgents used some route deemed not that sensitive,” Murad told a news briefing late on Monday.
The U.S. military did not carry out any airstrikes in support of Afghan forces in Kunduz, U.S. officials said.
“The mujahideen are trying to avoid any harm to Kunduz residents,” he said on his official Twitter account, referring to Taliban fighters.
Kunduz city was the center of fierce fighting earlier this year as the Taliban sought to gain territory after the end of NATO’s combat mission at the end of 2014.
