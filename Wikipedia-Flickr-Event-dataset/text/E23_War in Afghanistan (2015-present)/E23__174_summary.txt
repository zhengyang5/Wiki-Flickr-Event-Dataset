PESHAWAR, Pakistan - More than 40 NATO vehicles were destroyed in two separate Taliban attacks in Pakistan Wednesday as the militants stepped up their efforts to disrupt supply routes into Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for both of Wednesday's attacks, along with the previous raids.
"We will further intensify attacks with the intensification of U.S. drone strikes on us," Tehreek-e-Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq told AFP.
The latest tanker attacks came as the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan remained closed for a seventh day running.
Pakistan shut the route at Torkham in protest at a cross-border NATO helicopter attack that killed at least two Pakistani soldiers.
