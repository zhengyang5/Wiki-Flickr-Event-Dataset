The Afghan Surge Is OverThe U.S. troop surge in Afghanistan ended last week.
But in mid-2009, as American surge forces began flooding into southern Afghanistan, the ISI adopted a far more hands-on strategy.
The Afghan army, it appears, should be able to protect major cities and other critical areas.
Surge proponents insist that the influx of troops was essential to reversing the Taliban’s momentum and creating enough breathing room to build the Afghan army.
Their numbers — and those of the training force for the Afghan army — could have been augmented without a full-on surge.
