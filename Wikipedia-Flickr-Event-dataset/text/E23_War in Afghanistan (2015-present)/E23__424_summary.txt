Sgt Alexander Blackman received a life sentence in 2013, but his murder conviction was reduced to manslaughter after a high-profile campaign.
Blackman was convicted of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, and his supporters had hoped he would be reinstated to the Royal Marines.
Blackman, from Taunton, Somerset, was known as Marine A during the original trial process and fully identified after he was found guilty.
Blackman told his original trial he believed the victim was already dead and he was taking out his anger on a corpse.
