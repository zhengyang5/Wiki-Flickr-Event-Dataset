WASHINGTON, March 25 (UPI) -- There will be more U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan this summer than in Iraq for the first time since 2003, a military commander told lawmakers in Washington.
U.S. President Barack Obama in a December address to the nation committed 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
U.S. combat forces in Iraq, meanwhile, are to total fewer than 50,000 by September under the provisions outlined in a bilateral security agreement with Baghdad.
U.S., international and Afghan forces are shifting their focus in Afghanistan to Kandahar province.
A February offensive into the restive province of Helmand was meant to install a Western-friendly government in former Taliban territory.
