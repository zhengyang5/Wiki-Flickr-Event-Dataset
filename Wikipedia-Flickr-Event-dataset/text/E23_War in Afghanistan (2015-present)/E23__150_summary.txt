KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban will not be able to derail this month’s Afghan elections, President Hamid Karzai vowed on Tuesday, as military officials said at least seven Afghan and foreign troops had been killed in the latest violence.
Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers patrol a road in Kandagal in the Pesh Valley in Afghanistan's Kunar Province August 1, 2009.
With August following the pattern of July, the deadliest month of the 8-year-old-war for foreign troops, the U.S. military said three more Americans had been killed in three separate incidents in the volatile south since Saturday.
ISAF spokeswoman U.S. Captain Regina Gillis said there were “multiple” Afghan casualties.
This in turn would give the Taliban the opportunity to step up attacks and expand their territory, it said.
