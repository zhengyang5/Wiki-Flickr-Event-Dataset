Attacks expose weakness of key Afghanistan supply routeKABUL (AFP) â€” Two sophisticated Taliban raids on NATO trucks in Pakistan have exposed the dangerous vulnerability of the vital supply route for international troops in Afghanistan through the legendary Khyber Pass.
It makes the famous 50-kilometre (30-mile) mountain pass -- used since the time of Alexander the Great -- indispensable to international forces.
Blanchette played down the impact of the attacks, which he said had no effect on operations in Afghanistan.
Colonel Greg Julian, a spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan, said he expected Pakistan's military to increase security, with the force heavily dependent on the Khyber pass route.
Afghanistan has a long border with Iran, but Tehran's hostile relations with the United States rule that option out.
