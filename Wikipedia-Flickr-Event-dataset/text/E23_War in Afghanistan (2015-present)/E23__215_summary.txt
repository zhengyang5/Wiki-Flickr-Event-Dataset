President Barack Obama has promised to speed up a transfer of lead security responsibility from NATO to Afghan forces this spring, in a sign the pace of US troop withdrawals could quicken.
"Starting this spring, our troops will have a different mission - training, advising, assisting Afghan forces," Obama said.
Obama said any agreement on troop withdrawals must include an immunity agreement in which US troops are not subjected to Afghan law.
With some 66,000 US troops currently in Afghanistan, Obama is also deciding on the pace of this year's troop reductions.
NATO allies are also steadily reducing troop numbers and Afghan forces are due to take the lead role in security across the country in 2013.
