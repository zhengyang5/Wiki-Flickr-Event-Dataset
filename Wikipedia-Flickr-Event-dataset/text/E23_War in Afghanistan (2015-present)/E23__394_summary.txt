Pro-government forces (PGF) were responsible for 14 per cent of civilian deaths, a nine per cent drop from casualty figures from a comparable period last year.
Six per cent of civilian deaths were not attributed to any party to the conflict.
With 368 civilian deaths, May was the deadliest month for Afghan civilians since UNAMA began systematically documenting civilian casualties in 2007.
Air strikes remained the leading cause of Afghan civilian deaths by PGF, with an increasing proportion resulting from attacks by helicopters.
“All civilian deaths and injuries, no matter what party is responsible, have tragic and lasting impacts on families and communities,” said Mr. de Mistura.
