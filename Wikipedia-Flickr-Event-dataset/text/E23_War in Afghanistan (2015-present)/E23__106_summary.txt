WARSAW (Reuters) - A Polish military court cleared seven soldiers of war crime charges Wednesday over the killing of civilians in Afghanistan four years ago.
While serving in the NATO mission in 2007, the soldiers shelled the Afghan village of Nangar Khel, killing six civilians, including women and children, and injuring two more who later died in hospital.
“This is an unprecedented event in the history of the Polish judiciary,” said the judge, Colonel Miroslaw Jaroszewski, adding that the accusation prepared by prosecutors was faulty.
Poland hopes to withdraw all its troops from the Afghan mission by 2014.
NATO and Afghan officials said Sunday at least nine civilians were killed in a NATO-led air strike in one of the deadliest foreign assaults on civilians in Afghanistan in months.
