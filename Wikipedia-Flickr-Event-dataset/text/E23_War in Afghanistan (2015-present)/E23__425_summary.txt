SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Army on Friday dropped one of the murder charges against the soldier originally accused of killing 17 Afghan villagers in March, reducing the number of murder counts to 16 due to the double-counting of one of the dead, officials said.
Initial reports from Afghanistan had put the death toll at 16 people, despite the Army’s original decision to charge Bales with 17 counts of murder.
The number of murder counts was reduced to 16 only after “extensive interviews of family members” of those shot to confirm there were 16 dead and not 17, Dangerfield said.
Dangerfield could not immediately say how many children might be included among the dead from the amended 16 murder counts, and newly filed charging documents did not provide details on that.
In the new charging documents, Bales is also accused of burning several bodies of Afghan villagers.
