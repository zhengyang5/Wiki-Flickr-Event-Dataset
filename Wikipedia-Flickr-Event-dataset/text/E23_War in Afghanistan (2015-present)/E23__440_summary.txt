WASHINGTON - Afghan National Army soldiers with cell phones can't always be trusted before a combat operation.
Afghan troops are also notorious for "using their rifle butts to ask questions," or simply selling their AK-47s and U.S.-issued M-16s, Pelton said.
He also witnessed Afghan troops being trained to hand out trinkets to village kids for information - only to see them smacking kids with their rifle butts for stealing the same trinkets.
The most competent are often recruited into the tiny Afghan Commandos, militias hired at triple the ANA pay rate by Green Berets, or elite, CIA-run Afghan Counter-Terrorist Pursuit Teams.
There's still another heartbreaking reality top brass prefer to avoid discussing: Afghan troops killing the very U.S. and NATO trainers trying to help them.
