Today, Zabihullah’s boast has become reality, possibly making it the most deadly Taliban attack on a military installation in nearly five years.
Afghan officials are reporting that more than 140 Afghan soldiers are believed to have been killed, and that number may rise.
From Reuters:One official in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, where the attack occurred, said on Saturday at least 140 soldiers were killed and many others wounded.
The suicide assault was carried out by 10 Taliban fighters dressed as Afghan policemen, according to Reuters.
