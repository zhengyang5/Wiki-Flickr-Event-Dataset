Indeed, some senior Afghan officials say the Pakistani military was central to bringing the Haqqanis more closely into the Taliban during the insurgency’s leadership councils last summer, which were held in Quetta.
The United States contributes billions of dollars of aid to the Pakistani command, and American officials have pushed Pakistani officials to bring the Taliban to the negotiation table and ease the insurgent campaign in Afghanistan.
Even as American and Afghan officials have demanded that Pakistan do what it can to limit the insurgent offensive this year, there has been little obvious result.
The Taliban command or contest large swaths of Afghan territory, threaten important provincial capitals and, through the Haqqanis’ bombing campaign, continue to create carnage and fear in Kabul, the capital.
“Pakistan is at a strategic crossroads — I think it needs to make a choice.”
