Afghan officials in Helmand say the army is facing an insurgent fighting force that is better-organized and more skilled than ever.
A senior Taliban commander confirmed the existence of the new, highly-trained force.
The Taliban commander said that casualties among the commando unit had been minimal, but he gave no numbers.
By contrast, Afghan forces are suffering rising casualty numbers, according to U.S. military commanders.
