A new elite Marine Corps unit that allegedly killed at least eight civilians in the aftermath of an ambush in eastern Afghanistan this month is under investigation by the U.S. military and has been ordered to leave the country months earlier than scheduled, officials said yesterday.
In an unusual move, Maj. Gen. Francis H. Kearney III, who commands U.S. Special Operations forces in the Middle East and Central Asia, ordered the 120-strong Marine Corps Special Operations Company to leave Afghanistan because the incident so damaged the unit's relations with the local Afghan population that it could not carry out its mission, the officials said.
The unit arrived in Afghanistan about two months ago for a six-month tour and is now preparing to redeploy, Leto said.
The company was the first of nine that are planned to deploy under the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, established in February 2006 to incorporate Marines into U.S. Special Operations forces, which include Army Special Forces, Rangers, Navy SEALs and others.
The Marine Corps had initially resisted creating the new command, which is assigned about 2,600 Marines and sailors and has consumed much of the Marines' specialized reconnaissance forces.
