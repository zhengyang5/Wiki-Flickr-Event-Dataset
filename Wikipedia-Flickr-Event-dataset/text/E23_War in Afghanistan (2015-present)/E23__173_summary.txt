Responding to questions from American officials, Pakistani officials acknowledged Thursday that the video had not been faked, as they had first contended, an American official said, and that they had identified the soldiers and would take appropriate measures.
The country is also the prime supply route for the Afghan war, a fact Pakistani and American officials are both keenly aware of.
On Thursday, Pakistani officials gave them a glimpse of how much harder they could make the Afghan war.
Coalition helicopters fired into Pakistan three times, with one helicopter briefly breaching Pakistani airspace, according to Maj. Sunset Belinsky, a NATO spokeswoman.
Another border post, at Kharlachi, also in Kurram, was struck a few hours later, the official added.
