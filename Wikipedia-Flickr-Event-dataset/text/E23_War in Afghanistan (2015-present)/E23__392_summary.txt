Over the past four years, 8,832 civilians have been killed in the conflict with civilian deaths increasing each year.
“2011 should be a year of escalating civilian protection, not another year of increasing civilian casualties,” she added.
Anti-government elements were linked to 2,080 civilian deaths (75 per cent of all civilian deaths), up 28 per cent from 2009, while pro-government forces were linked to 440 civilian deaths (16 per cent), down 26 per cent from 2009.
Nine per cent of civilian deaths in 2010 could not be attributed to any party to the conflict.
Among tactics used by pro-government forces, aerial attacks continued to have the highest human cost in 2010, killing 171 civilians or 39 per cent of total civilian deaths linked to pro-government forces.
