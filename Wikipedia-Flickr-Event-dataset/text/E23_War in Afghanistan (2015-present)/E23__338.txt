President Barack Obama has approved giving the US military greater ability to accompany and enable Afghan forces battling a resilient Taliban insurgency, in a move to assist them more proactively on the battlefield, a US official told Reuters.

The senior US defence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the decision would also allow greater use of US air power, particularly close air support.

However, the official cautioned: "This is not a blanket order to target the Taliban."

Under the new policy, the US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, will be able to decide when it is appropriate for American troops to accompany conventional Afghan forces into the field - something they have so far only been doing with Afghan special operations forces, the official said.
