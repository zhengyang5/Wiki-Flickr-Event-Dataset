Mr. Karzai, now in his eighth year as president, has consistently resisted previous American demands that he clean up his government.
Even by their numbers alone, the Afghan forces are woefully inadequate: there are currently about 90,000 Afghan soldiers and about 93,000 Afghan police officers.
President Obama and his field commanders intend to rapidly expand the rank of Afghans under arms to about 240,000 soldiers and 160,000 police officers.
They also intend to augment those forces by supporting local defense forces — Afghan militias — in villages and towns.
In the end, training Afghan soldiers and pressuring Afghan officials will succeed only if the American-led war has the support of ordinary Afghans themselves.
