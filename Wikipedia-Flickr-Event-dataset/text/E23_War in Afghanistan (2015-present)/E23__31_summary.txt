Now and then a truck jounced past carrying Northern Alliance soldiers to the Kunduz front, which had settled into a tense standoff between Alliance and Taliban forces.
On Monday the Northern Alliance commander, Mohammed Dawood Khan, was expecting a rout.
His troops were chasing Taliban soldiers down the road from Taloqan to Kunduz, and a key Taliban commander had promised to defect.
On Tuesday a group of about 200 Taliban soldiers seemed to be giving themselves up to the Alliance near Bangi.
When Alliance soldiers approached them to take their weapons, the Arabs detonated the bombs strapped to their bodies, killing themselves and five Alliance soldiers.
