KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- August had the most fatalities this year for civilians in Afghanistan because of the country's disputed election, and violence could rise again when the final results are released, a U.N. report warns.
A NATO armored vehicle escorts a convoy of supply trucks Friday in Kabul, Afghanistan.
About 1,500 people died in Afghanistan from the beginning of the year to August, according to the U.N. report released this week.
"August (was) the deadliest month since the beginning of 2009," the report said.
So far this month, 34 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan, according to CNN figures compiled from military reports.
