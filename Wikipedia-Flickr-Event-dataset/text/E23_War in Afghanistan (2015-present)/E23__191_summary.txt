The decision to publish the photos, provided by an anonymous soldier, also set off a debate about whether the newspaper had acted responsibly.
We had urged the LA Times not to run those photos and the reason for that is those kinds of photos are used by the enemy."
He repeated the Pentagon's argument that the newspaper should not have published the photos.
The soldier who provided the Times with a series of 18 photos of soldiers posing with corpses did so on condition of anonymity.
He said the photos pointed to a breakdown in leadership and discipline that he believed compromised the safety of the troops.
