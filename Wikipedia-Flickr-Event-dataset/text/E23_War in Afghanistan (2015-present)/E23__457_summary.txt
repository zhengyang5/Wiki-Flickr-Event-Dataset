Almost two in three Australians think the country's foreign policy places too much emphasis on the United States, and most people now oppose military involvement in Afghanistan.
Of those surveyed, 56 per cent opposed Australia's military commitment, and 42 per cent expressed support.
More than 85 per cent of Australians think China will become ''the leading power in Asia'', while 60 per cent say ''China's aim is to dominate Asia''.
A narrow majority of Australians believed Australia should join with other countries in an effort to limit China's growing influence.
Two- thirds think Australia is not doing enough to pressure China on human rights.
