US action along the Pakistan border has raised tensions Pakistan says its troops fired warning shots at two Nato helicopters as they crossed the border from Afghanistan.
It is the first time the Pakistan army has admitted opening fire near US or Nato forces, as tension grows over cross border military action.
Nato said its aircraft were not in Pakistani airspace when shots were fired over Khost province.
The BBC's Martin Patience, in Kabul, says it is believed to be the first time Nato helicopters have been fired on in this fashion.
The US and Nato have called on Pakistan to do more to curb militants operating in the border area.
