FILE PHOTO - Taliban new leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada is seen in an undated photograph, posted on a Taliban twitter feed on May 25, 2016, and identified separately by several Taliban officials, who declined be named.
Peace talks broke down last year after it was revealed that Mansour had covered up the death of the Talibanâ€™s founder Mullah Mohammad Omar two years earlier.
Efforts to revive them in a framework backed by Pakistan, the United States and China have so far failed.
Pledging to continue on the course set by Mullah Mansour, he promised to strengthen justice, help the injured and the poor and guarantee the rights of women under Sharia law.
He also told Taliban fighters not to harm Muslims or public facilities including hospitals, schools, bridges and public utilities and not to oppress areas under their control.
