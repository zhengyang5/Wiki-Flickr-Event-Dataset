Sheberghan Prison and Pit Locations at Dasht-e-Leili

This Google Earth image shows the town of Sheberghan, Sheberghan Prison, and the location of the two pits at Dasht-e-Leili, where earth was dug and the fill from the pits taken away.

In April 2002, PHR forensic experts dug a test trench as part of a preliminary investigation for the UN at the Dasht-e-Leili mass grave site near Sheberghan, Afghanistan, and exposed 15 bodies. Three of these were autopsied; the experts found that the likely cause of death was consistent with suffocation.
