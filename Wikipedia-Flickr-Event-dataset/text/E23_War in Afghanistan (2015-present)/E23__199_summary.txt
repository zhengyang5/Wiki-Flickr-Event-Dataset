A video has surfaced online that appears to show a US helicopter crew singing "Bye-bye Miss American Pie" before blasting a group of Afghan men with a Hellfire missile.
The posting says the video was recorded in Wardak province, which lies south-west of the capital, Kabul, in September 2009.
The caption refers sarcastically to a group of "innocent farmers planting poppy seeds in the middle of the road".
In the video, after the bomb appears to hit the group, survivors scatter, and the helicopter aims machine gun fire at them.
In January a video surfaced of marines apparently urinating on Taliban corpses, and last year a group were tried for murdering three Afghan civilians for sport.
