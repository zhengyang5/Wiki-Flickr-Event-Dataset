It was the first decline in overall civilian casualties since 2012.
The United Nations credited better targeting in the American-led air campaign, compared with previous years.
The report blamed the Islamic State’s Afghan branch for 1,000 civilian casualties — 399 killed and 601 wounded.
“While emphasizing that no civilian casualties are acceptable, the reduced harm ratio suggests improvements,” it said.
The strike killed 10 children and three women in the house, according to witnesses who spoke to United Nations researchers.
