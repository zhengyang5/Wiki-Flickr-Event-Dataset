There are signs of deepening splits among Afghanistan’s Taliban after a spokesman denied that peace talks between Afghan officials and senior Taliban leaders are authorized by the group.
Taliban officials, including Mullah Mohammad Hassan, Rahmani, Mullah Abdul Razaq and Mullah Abdul Jalil, reportedly attended the meeting.
Islamabad’s support is seen critical for promoting the Afghan peace because much of the Taliban leadership has been based in Pakistan since the Islamist group was ousted from power in 2001.
On Tuesday, Afghan lawmakers accused the Pakistani spy agency, the ISI, for being behind this month’s Taliban attack on the Afghan parliament.
They alleged that the legislature was punished for opposing an intelligence sharing deal that the Afghan National Directorate of Security has recently signed with the ISI.
