Dostum's men hauled the bodies into the nearby desert and buried them in mass graves, according to Afghan human rights officials.
He said that when Dostum's men shot into the metal box, "some people were shot in the eye; some were shot in the neck."
"The hope had been to do a full exhumation in 2003," said Nathaniel Raymond, a senior investigator at Physicians for Human Rights.
The U.N., NATO, U.S. forces and the Afghan government never took any formal responsibility for patrolling the grave site.
The grave sites, which Dostum's men brought in international journalists to document, helped cement Pahlawan's exile from the area at the time.
