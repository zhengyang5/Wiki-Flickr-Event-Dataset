Washington (CNN) -- A December 22 briefing, prepared by the top U.S. intelligence official in Afghanistan and obtained by CNN, maps out the strategy and strength of the Taliban and their allies in Afghanistan, and concludes that the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan is increasingly effective.
According to the Flynn briefing, the Taliban have largely re-created the command structure they had before the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in fall 2001.
The Flynn briefing suggests that the Taliban are effectively creating a parallel government, in competition with the Kabul government.
The number of casualties from improvised-explosive attacks in Afghanistan has risen from 326 in 2005 to 6,037 in 2009, according to the briefing.
The Flynn briefing also outlined Taliban weaknesses, including disagreements among local Taliban leaders, the group's dependence on marginalized ethnic Pashtuns, and over-reliance on "external support," an apparent reference to Taliban havens in Pakistan.
