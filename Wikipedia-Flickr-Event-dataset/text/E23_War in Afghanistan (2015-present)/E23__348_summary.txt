Saad Emarati was one of the founders of the IS group's Afghanistan-Pakistan branch, and led several attacks against the Taliban and the government.
Emarati was formerly a Taliban commander, but switched allegiance to IS following the death of Mullah Omar, the Taliban founder.
He was a former Afghan Taliban commander in central Logar province who was sidelined and disarmed by the Taliban leadership for "unauthorised activities" in 2013.
