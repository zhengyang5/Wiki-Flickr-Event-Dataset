After years of war, Mr. Samad, a poor farmer, had been reluctant to return to his home in Panjwai, which was known in good times for its grapes and mulberries.
Mr. Samad and his teenage son survived because they had been visiting the nearby town of Spinbaldak.
The military would bring “appropriate charges” against the soldier, Mr. Panetta said, and the death penalty “could be a consideration.”He said the military was still struggling to understand a motive.
Many Afghans, including Mr. Samad, continued to doubt that the attack was the work of a single gunman, as the military said.
As for Mr. Samad, he said he was in too much despair to even think about how he would carry on with his life.
