KABUL, Afghanistan — The secretary general of NATO sought Tuesday to address fears that international forces would leave Afghanistan too soon, saying that the 43 nations in Afghanistan would stand by the country until it was ready to stand on its own.
In his remarks at a joint news conference with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the NATO secretary general, tried to reassure those who feared that a premature withdrawal would leave the Afghan people and government vulnerable to Taliban insurgents.
“I know some are wondering how long international forces will stay; they are worried we will leave too soon,” Mr. Rasmussen said.
