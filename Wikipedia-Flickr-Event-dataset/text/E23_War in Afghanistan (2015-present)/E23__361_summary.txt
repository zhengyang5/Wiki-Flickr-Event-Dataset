The most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in combat was dropped on an IS base in Nangarhar province.
The death toll was confirmed to the BBC by Ismail Shinwary, the governor of Achin province within Nangarhar.
Known as the "mother of all bombs", or MOAB, the device was dropped on Thursday evening by an MC-130 transport plane, falling in Nangarhar's Achin district.
It was the first time the bomb, one of only 15 ever built, had been used in combat.
