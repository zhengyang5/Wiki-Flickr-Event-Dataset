The US has 8,500 soldiers stationed in Afghanistan (AFP Photo/Martin Bureau)Washington (AFP) - Five US special forces troops have been wounded fighting the Islamic State group in eastern Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, the US commander said Thursday.
The Americans were wounded "in the last several days" while taking part in a joint operation with Afghan army troops in eastern Nangarhar province, Nicholson said.
The Afghan army has intensified operations against IS since the jihadists claimed two bombings over the weekend in Kabul that left 80 dead and 231 wounded.
There are about 9,800 US troops in Afghanistan with a mission to advise and assist the Afghan military but also to fight extremist groups like Al-Qaeda or IS.
"We will continue to stay after Daesh until they are defeated here in Afghanistan," Nicholson, using an Arabic acronym for IS.
