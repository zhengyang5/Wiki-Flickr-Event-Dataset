Afghanistan's vaunted heroin trade is back — and many of its proceeds are going to likely terror supporters as well as members of the incumbent government, experts told ABCNEWS.

It is possible more obvious elements of al Qaeda and Taliban could also be profiting from the heroin trade as well, experts said.

Dealing with the drug problem will also entail developing alternatives for Afghan farmers, like artichokes, avocados, cut flowers, and lavender — and then finding markets for them.
