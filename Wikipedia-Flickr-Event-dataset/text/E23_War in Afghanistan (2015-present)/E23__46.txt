KABUL, Afghanistan — The secretary general of NATO sought Tuesday to address fears that international forces would leave Afghanistan too soon, saying that the 43 nations in Afghanistan would stand by the country until it was ready to stand on its own.

In his remarks at a joint news conference with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the NATO secretary general, tried to reassure those who feared that a premature withdrawal would leave the Afghan people and government vulnerable to Taliban insurgents.

“I know some are wondering how long international forces will stay; they are worried we will leave too soon,” Mr. Rasmussen said. “Let there be no doubt, the international community will stand with you and help in rebuilding your country until you are ready to stand on your own, and ensure that terrorism will never take root again.”

The NATO commitment is particularly important to the United States because it gives international legitimacy to the war. But the commitment is also important because the European members of the coalition, which includes forces from NATO and non-NATO nations, face considerable domestic opposition to having their troops in harm’s way, and at times in the past year have seemed on the brink of reducing the numbers fighting.
