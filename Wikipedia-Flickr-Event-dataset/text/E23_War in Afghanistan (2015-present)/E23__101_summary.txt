The Afghan case was reiterated in a report Saturday from the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.
The Times writes that the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission worries incidents like this are undermining coalition efforts to win Afghan support.
Even when they're aiming at military targets, insurgent attacks are often so indiscriminate that Afghan civilians end up as the main victims."
The report says that at least 669 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in 2006, and another 52 were killed in January and February 2007.
