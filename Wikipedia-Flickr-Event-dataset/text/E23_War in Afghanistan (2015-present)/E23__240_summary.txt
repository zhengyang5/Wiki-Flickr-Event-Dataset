CAMP SHORABAK, Afghanistan -- Afghan officials confirmed for the first time Monday that the extremist Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is active in the south, recruiting fighters, flying black flags and, according to some sources, even battling Taliban militants.
But he said the Taliban, which is active across Helmand and controls some districts, have warned people not to contact Rauf.
"There are reports that 19 or 20 people have been killed" in fighting between the Taliban and ISIS, he added.
A video released online Saturday purports to show militants from both Afghanistan and Pakistan pledging support to ISIS.
The Taliban have confined their insurgency to Afghanistan, and do not espouse the pan-Islamic model of jihad embraced by ISIS.
