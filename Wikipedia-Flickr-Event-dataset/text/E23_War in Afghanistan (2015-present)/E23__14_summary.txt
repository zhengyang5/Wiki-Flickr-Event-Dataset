A senior Afghan army general has told Al Jazeera that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group has been active in Afghanistan.
On Sunday, Lieutenant-General Murad Ali Murad, commander of Afghan army's ground forces, told Al Jazeera that "elements under the ISIL flag" have been trying recruit fighters in Afghanistan.
She said Murad made clear that Afghan army could handle any kind of enemy, regardless of their affiliation.
ISIL seized large parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq last summer.
A US-led international coalition battling ISIL has been conducting air strikes against the group in Syria and Iraq, while Kurdish peshmerga, central Iraqi forces and Sunni tribesmen have been fighting against ISIL fighters on the ground.
