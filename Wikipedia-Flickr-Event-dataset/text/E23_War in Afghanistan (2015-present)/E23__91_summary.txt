Hundreds of British troops are already in Helmand and the full complement will eventually number more than 3,000.
Last week Taleban fighters told the BBC they planned to target and kill British troops in Helmand, one commander labelling the British "an old enemy of Afghanistan".
He said British troops had a "very clear" mission and would not go "looking for trouble".
Defence Secretary John Reid denied there was any confusion, saying the mission was "to protect the reconstruction and development of the Afghan economy, democratic government and security forces".
He added: "However, it will be necessary to protect that development against terrorists who seek to destroy all three of those elements, or to attack British troops."
