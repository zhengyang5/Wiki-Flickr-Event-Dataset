KABUL (Reuters) - An Afghan member of parliament was killed by a bomb planted near his residence in the capital Kabul on Sunday, the interior ministry said.
The device, hidden in a electrical box attached to a wall exploded as Shir Wali Wardak left his house, ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said.
The attack came hours after Taliban insurgents stormed a courthouse south of Kabul, killing at least five people including a newly appointed appeals court head.
The militants have vowed revenge for the hanging on May 8 of six Taliban prisoners convicted of terrorism as part of a security crackdown after a suicide attack in Kabul in April that killed 64 people.
Afghanistan is set to hold delayed parliamentary elections in October after last Juneâ€™s deadline was missed.
