A large car bomb exploded near the outer wall of the compound, sending up a thick plume of smoke.
Six Taliban fighters then tried to storm inside, said police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi.
Afghan security forces managed to fend off the attackers, who then moved into a nearby building, firing rockets and AK-47 machine guns.
All six attackers were killed in the ensuing firefight, Karimi said.
Inside the parliament building, lawmakers were gathered in a meeting hall when the first explosion struck, Arif Rahmani, a member of parliament, told CNN.
