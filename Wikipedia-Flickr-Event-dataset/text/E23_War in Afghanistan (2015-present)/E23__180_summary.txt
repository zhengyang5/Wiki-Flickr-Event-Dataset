Reporting from Paris â€” Following America's lead, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced Thursday that his nation would begin to gradually withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.
Sarkozy did not specify the number of troops to be brought home but said French forces would start handing over areas they control to the Afghan military.
He made his announcement shortly after speaking with President Obama by telephone.
In a national address Wednesday, Obama announced that the United States would withdraw 10,000 of its more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan this year, and another 23,000 by September 2012.
