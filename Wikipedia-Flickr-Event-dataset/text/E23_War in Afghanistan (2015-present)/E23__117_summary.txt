Advertisement By Alastair LeitheadBBC News, HelmandAlmost three thousand British troops in southern Afghanistan have successfully transported a huge hydroelectric power turbine through Taleban territory.
In one of their biggest operations in Helmand, a convoy of 100 vehicles took five days to move the massive sections of the turbine 180km (112 miles).
A spokesman said it was the largest route clearance operation the British military has carried out since World War II.
It included fuel trucks and the eight heavy equipment transporters carrying a crane and the Chinese-made turbine.
At least getting the turbine in and achieving one of the main aims of the last three years is a sign of progress in the Helmand valley where most of Britain's 8,000 troops are based.
