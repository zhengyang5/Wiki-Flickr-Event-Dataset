KABUL, Feb 12 (Reuters) - At least 18 civilians were killed last week in air strikes by international forces in Afghanistan’s Helmand province, an initial United Nations inquiry has concluded.
American military officials say their aircraft have conducted around 30 air strikes in Helmand in the past week.
“We are investigating the allegations and working diligently to determine whether civilians were killed or injured as a result of U.S. air strikes,” said Brigadier General Charles Cleveland.
On Thursday and Friday air strikes in Helmand’s Sangin district killed as many as 18 civilians, mostly women and children, according to a U.N. statement released on Sunday.
Civilian casualties from both American and Afghan air strikes increased dramatically last year, according to the U.N.’s most recent report on threats to civilians.
