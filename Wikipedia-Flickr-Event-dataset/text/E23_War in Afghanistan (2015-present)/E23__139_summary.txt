Despite repeated queries by IPS to the State Department spokesman P. J. Crowley and to the National Security Council's press office over the past week about whether either Secretary Clinton or President Obama had been informed about the Taliban offer, neither office has responded to the question.

The Pakistani Taliban continue to be closely allied with al Qaeda.
But it began to hint publicly at its willingness to separate itself from al Qaeda in return for a troop withdrawal only three months ago.
