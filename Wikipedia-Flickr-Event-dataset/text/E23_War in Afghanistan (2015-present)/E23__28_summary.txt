(Najim Rahim via AP)What remains of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is now working more closely with the Taliban, a spokesman for the U.S. led-mission there told reporters Thursday.
Gen. Charles Cleveland, al-Qaeda is providing more “capabilities and skills” to the 30,000 strong insurgent group than they have in the past.
According to Cleveland, there are roughly 300 al-Qaeda fighters still in Afghanistan spread out across a number of provinces such as Kunar, Kandahar and Ghazni.
The United States has roughly 10,000 troops still in Afghanistan providing advice and assistance to the embattled Afghan security forces.
Since January the United States has conducted roughly 120 airstrikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan, the majority of which were aimed at the Islamic State.
