(AP Photo/Steve Ruark, File)WASHINGTON (AP) â€” It was a sneak attack, but not by the enemy they feared.
The Associated Press learned details of the attack from formerly secret Army investigation records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.
The attack that killed Lawrence and Russell in the southern city of Kandahar was the 17th of 2011.
The two officers and five other U.S. soldiers were inside a soft-skinned, tan-colored tent that served as a temporary "tactical command post" on an Afghan army base known as Old Corps Headquarters.
