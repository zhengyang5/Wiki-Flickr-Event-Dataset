Afghanistan explosion: Taliban suicide bomber, gunmen attack parliament building in Kabul killing two, wounding at least 30UpdatedA Taliban suicide bomber and several gunmen have attacked the Afghan parliament in Kabul, killing a woman and child and wounding at least 30 people.
The brazen attack on the symbolic centre of power raises questions about the NATO-trained Afghan security forces' ability to cope with militant attacks.
Six gunmen who took up positions in a building near parliament were killed after a gun battle lasting nearly two hours, Mr Karimi said.
They proceeded to attack the parliament building with RPGs, rockets, and a lot of gunfire from a construction site nearby, from an empty building where they could hide behind scaffolding."
Violence has spiralled in Afghanistan since the departure of most foreign forces at the end of last year.
