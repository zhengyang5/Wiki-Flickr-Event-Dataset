"Mullah Salam and the Taliban fighters under him murdered and terrorized the people of Kunduz for too long," said Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan.
The people of Afghanistan want peace and the government of Afghanistan is committed to achieving peace through reconciliation.
The city of Kunduz, home to roughly 400,000 people, has become a microcosm of America's struggle to stabilize Afghanistan.
Twice in the past two years the northern Afghan city has fallen to Taliban militants, in part due to corrupt politics and failed policies.
Afghan security forces and their American counterparts have yet to tame the city, casting shadow on Washington's continued claim that government forces can maintain control of the country's urban centers.
