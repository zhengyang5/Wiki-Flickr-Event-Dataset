The Afghanistan that return refugees encounter upon their arrival is far from the economically and politically stable country that they might have hoped for.
Many return refugees have been unable to go back to their places of origin for reasons of continued insecurity or the lack of a viable livelihood.
However, the country that for decades has hosted Afghan refugees has become the site of extensive military activity that has displaced Pakistanis internally as well as back and forth into Afghanistan.
In recent years political momentum has also been building in Pakistan to compel Afghan refugees to repatriate.
In July 2012, the Pakistani government announced it would not renew the ID cards of registered Afghan refugees, and as of January 2013, will treat them as illegal immigrants.
