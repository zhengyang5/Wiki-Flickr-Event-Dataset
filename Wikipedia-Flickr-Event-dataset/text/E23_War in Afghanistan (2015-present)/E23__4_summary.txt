Many of the foreign militants in North Waziristan belong to the al-Qaeda and Taliban-linked group, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU).
Nobody knows exactly how many Uzbek fighters there are in Pakistan - estimates vary wildly from several hundred to a few thousand.
Usually better educated and with a Soviet military background, the IMU militants have carried out many attacks on Pakistani military and civilians since around 2006.

Since then IMU militants have been accused of numerous suicide attacks and of killing hundreds of tribal elders in Pakistan over the years.
