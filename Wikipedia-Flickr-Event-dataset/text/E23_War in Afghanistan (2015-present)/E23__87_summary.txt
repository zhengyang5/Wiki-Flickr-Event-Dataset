ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)  The war in Afghanistan is not just about bombing mountain hide-outs, it's also about getting a message out.

The anti-American pamphlets are called ``night letters,'' secretly circulated and strewn by the hundreds in towns, villages and countryside.
In some parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan touching a woman, other than a relative, can be enough to get a person stoned to death.
