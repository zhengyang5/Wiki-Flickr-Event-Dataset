The commander, Mawlawi Abdul Manan, was killed with other insurgents trying to cross into Afghanistan from Pakistan, spokesman Major Chris Belcher said.

The Taleban have confirmed the death. Abdul Manan was a top commander in the eastern Afghan provinces of Khost, Paktia and Paktika.

The Americans say his death will be a severe blow to the insurgents.

US forces say Abdul Manan's group smuggled weapons and fighters across the border from Pakistan.

Elsewhere, Afghan and Nato forces are continuing to fight Taleban insurgents for control of two districts, Gulistan and Bakwa, in the western province of Farah.
