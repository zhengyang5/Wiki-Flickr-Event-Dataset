As part of one of the widest-ranging U.S. war-crime cases to emerge from the conflict in Afghanistan, charging documents released Wednesday allege soldiers took finger bones and other body parts cut from Afghan corpses.
The documents provide new public details of the cases against a dozen soldiers who served a year in southern Afghanistan with a Western Washington-based Stryker infantry brigade.
According to the charging documents, the case began when a soldier blew the whistle on the use of hashish.
It is unclear from charging documents whether that assault injured any of the Afghans.
Charging documents allege his statement was "totally false."
