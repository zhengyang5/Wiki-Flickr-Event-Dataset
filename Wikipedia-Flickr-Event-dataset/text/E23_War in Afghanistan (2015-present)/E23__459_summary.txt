AUSTRALIA'S involvement in the war in Afghanistan is increasingly unpopular, despite Prime Minister Kevin Rudd backing at the weekend a larger role for military trainers in the conflict.
The latest Age /Nielsen poll has found 51 per cent of voters oppose Australia's current involvement.
Two-thirds of voters oppose any increase in the number of Australian troops in Afghanistan.
Mr Rudd admitted during a TV interview in the US last week that the war in Afghanistan did not have broad voter support in Australia.
In February 2006, an Age/Nielsen poll found that 48 per cent of Australians opposed the war, while 45 per cent supported it.
