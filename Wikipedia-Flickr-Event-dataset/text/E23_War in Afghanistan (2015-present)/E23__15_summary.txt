By Mirwais Adeel - Tue Mar 31 2015, 6:56 amThe Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) militant group has released a new video which purportedly shows the beheading of an Afghan soldier while the group pledges allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist group.
The group is actively operating in northern provinces of Afghanistan and was previously operating under the shadow of the Taliban group.
Urgenji ALSO said his group was recognizing the authority of the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State group.
According to Urgenji the Afghan soldier was beheaded since numerous female IMU members were captured by the Afghan security forces in Faryab province recently.
Urgenji warned that more Afghan soldiers will be beheaded unless the Afghan government does not consider their demand to swap prisoners.
