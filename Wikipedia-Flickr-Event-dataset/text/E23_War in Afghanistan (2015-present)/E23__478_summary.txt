The military documents showed 12 attacks where militants used white phosphorus in mortar or rocket attacks.
The most recent documented attack came last Thursday when a Nato outpost in Logar was hit with two rounds of indirect white phosphorus fire.
The governor said Taliban fighters attacked the villagers with a flammable material, although it was not necessarily white phosphorus.
A US spokeswoman, Major Jenny Willis, said the use of white phosphorus as a weapon could cause "unnecessary suffering".
The US military used white phosphorus in the battle of Falluja in Iraq in November 2004.
