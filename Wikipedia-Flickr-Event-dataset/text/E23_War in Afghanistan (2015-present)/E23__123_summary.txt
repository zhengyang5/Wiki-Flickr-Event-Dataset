Khyber’s downward spiral is jeopardizing NATO’s most important supply line, sending American military officials scrambling to find alternative routes into Afghanistan through Russia and Central Asia.
A half-dozen raids on depots with NATO supplies here have already destroyed 300 cargo trucks and Humvees this month.
At a news conference there one month ago, Hakimullah Mehsud declared his intention to intensify attacks on NATO supply convoys.
Some security officials say they believe that he was behind the assassination in August of a rival militant leader, Hajji Namdar, in Khyber.
Taliban militants have also moved into Khyber after Pakistani military campaigns in nearby areas like Bajaur Agency.
