But 2013 might mark an improvement in Afghanistan's conflict if the number of civilian casualties continues on its current trend.
2012, the latest year for which numbers are available, has shown the first drop since the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) first began collecting on civilian casualties.
While we are pretty good at providing detailed statistical breakdowns of coalition military casualties (and by we, I mean the media as a whole), we've not been so good at providing any kind of breakdown of Afghan civilian casualties.
You've noticed the gap in media reporting - asking us why we publish military deaths but not civilian casualties.
The United Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) publishes statistics on civilian casualties, splitting them into deaths caused by government/military forces, anti-government forces and so on.
