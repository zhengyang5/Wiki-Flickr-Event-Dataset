Image caption Nato helped Afghan forces repel the wave of Taliban attackersGovernment forces have recaptured areas of the Afghan city of Kandahar seized by scores of militants after a two-day battle, the provincial governor says.
The Taliban say it was 100.
Whatever the number, the BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kabul says, the raid has paralysed Kandahar, the commercial hub of southern Afghanistan.
Afghan officials say the complex nature of the Taliban assault was due to the presence of these experienced fighters.
Nato spokesman Maj Gen James Laster described the Kandahar raid as a "spring offensive spectacular attack which was thwarted".
