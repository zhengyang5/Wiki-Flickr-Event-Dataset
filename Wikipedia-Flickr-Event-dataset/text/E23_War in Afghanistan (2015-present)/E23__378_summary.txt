Afghan officials say strike killed militants in Kunar province on Thursday but local MP claims victims were civiliansA US drone strike has killed 14 Islamic State militants, Afghan officials say.
The strike took place in a remote area of Afghanistan’s eastern Kunar province on Thursday afternoon.
The government has no control of the area where Afghanistan’s Isis affiliate has managed to establish a presence.
The MP for Kunar province, Shahzada Shaheed, challenged the report, however, claiming the victims of the strike were civilians.
The US has been bombing in Afghanistan since late 2001 and airstrikes have continued under the Trump administration, with many recent drone strikes and special operations missions aimed at Isis strongholds.
