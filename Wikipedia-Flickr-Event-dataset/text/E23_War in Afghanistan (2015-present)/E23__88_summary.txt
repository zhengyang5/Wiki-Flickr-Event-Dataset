Some Taliban leaders, such as Salam and Taliban commander Mullah Muhammad Hasan Rehmani, are giving interviews once again.
In Zabul Province last month, for instance, Taliban forces took control of two remote districts near the Pakistani border for nearly a week.
He was the commander of Taliban forces during the US coalition's indecisive battle, Operation Anaconda, in the Shah-e Kot mountains.
In Pakistan, Taliban commanders are reportedly working in alliance with like-minded leaders of religious parties who now control two provinces along the Afghan-Pakistan border.
"During Taliban times, Pakistani colonels would bring money to support Taliban soldiers," he says.
