At least 100 Taliban fighters have attacked a district in Afghanistan's heavily embattled northern Kunduz province in an effort to take control of yet another district, officials said.
"Fortunately, our security forces have been able to push the Taliban back," Mahbubullah Saeedi, the district governor for Qalai Zal, where fighting is continuing, said on Monday.
Saeedi said that eight Taliban - including a commander - were killed, while one Afghan security force member was dead and three others wounded.
The capital of the province fell to the Taliban briefly last year, and most districts have a heavy Taliban presence.
We are stronger than ever and 8,400 troops cannot stop us.
