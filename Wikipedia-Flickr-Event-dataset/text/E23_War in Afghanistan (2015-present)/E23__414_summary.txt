US blocked probes into Afghan prisoner killings(AFP) – Jul 10, 2009WASHINGTON (AFP) — The Bush administration repeatedly sought to block investigations into alleged killings of up to 2,000 Taliban prisoners by a US-backed Afghan warlord in 2001, The New York Times reported Friday.
Washington was later concerned that an investigation could hurt Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who had the support of George W. Bush's administration, because Dostam served as a defense official in the fledgling government.
"We believe that anyone suspected of war crimes should be thoroughly investigated," the official added, hinting the Obama administration is open to an inquiry.
The killings took place in late November 2001, shortly after the invasion that ousted Kabul's Taliban government.
It is time for the cover-up to end," he added in a statement, saying the State Department official's comments indicate "a move toward full accountability."
