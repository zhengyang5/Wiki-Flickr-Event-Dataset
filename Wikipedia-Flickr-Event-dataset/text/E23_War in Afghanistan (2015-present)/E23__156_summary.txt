Source: Reuters Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai shortly after his re-election in November 2009Afghan President Hamid Karzai has met a senior delegation for peace talks with one of the main insurgent groups fighting against his government and foreign troops, Karzai's spokesman said.
Although the talks with delegates from the Hezb-i-Islami group appeared to be preliminary, it was Karzai's first confirmed direct contact with the faction and could signal prospects for a separate peace with a group that rivals the Taliban.
"I can confirm that a delegation of Hezb-i-Islami ... is in Kabul with a plan and has met with the president," Karzai's spokesman, Waheed Omer, said.
A spokesman for Hezb-i-Islami said it was the first time the group had sent senior envoys to Kabul for peace talks.
They had brought a 15-point peace plan which includes a demand for withdrawal of foreign troops, said Haroun Zarghoun, spokesman for the group's fugitive leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
