When the State Department announced the designation of ISIS in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a Foreign Terrorist Organization last week, it led to a change in the rules of engagement for U.S. forces, according to defense officials.
The designation applies to what the U.S. now calls ISIS-K (ISIS-Khorasan) , which is the ISIS branch in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
According to U.S. officials, the change now means that U.S. forces can actively pursue ISIS elements and attack them as a threat to the United States.
Previous rules of engagement required ISIS elements to first pose a threat to U.S. forces in the area or to be pursued as part of a specific counterterrorism mission, officials said.
