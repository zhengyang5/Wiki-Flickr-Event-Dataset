One year and four days after the Islamic State announced the formation of the “Khorasan Province,” the US State Department listed the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
The group is based in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region and is composed primarily of former members of Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban.
In Afghanistan, the Khorasan Province is thought to have 1,000 fighters who are largely confined to Nangarhar province.
The US has treated the Islamic State Khorasan Province as a terrorist organization long before officially listing it as terrorist organization.
Top leaders of the Khorasan Province have been targeted and killed in US airstrikes.
