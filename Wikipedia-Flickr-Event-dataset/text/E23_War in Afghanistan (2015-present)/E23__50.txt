WASHINGTON (AP) — Over the 14 years since the United States went to war in Afghanistan, the number of American troops there spiraled to 100,000 then dropped below 10,000, with plans to bring the rest home by the end of next year. Now President Barack Obama has put those withdrawal plans on hold.

A timeline of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan:

___

Oct. 7, 2001: President George W. Bush announces that U.S. and British troops have begun striking Afghanistan for harboring the al-Qaida terrorists blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks. The massive air campaign initially targets Taliban troops, training camps and air defenses.

___

November 2001: 1,300 American troops are in the country as commandos and ground troops, mainly Marines, begin to arrive.

___

December 2001: The U.S. force grows to 2,500 as troops scour the mountainous Tora Bora region looking for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. The Taliban is ousted and an interim Afghan government established.

___

March 2002: 7,200 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan as Americans lead allied Afghan forces in the largest ground assault of the war to that point.

___

December 2002: The U.S. ends the year with about 9,700 troops deployed, mostly going after Taliban insurgents.

___

December 2003: The year ends with about 13,100 troops in Afghanistan.

___

April 2004: The number swells to 20,300 as the U.S. builds up forces along the Afghan-Pakistan border and provides security for fledgling reconstruction projects.

___

December 2006: Attention has shifted to the escalating war in Iraq; the force in Afghanistan remains just over 20,000.

___

December 2007: The force in Afghanistan rises to 25,000. Still, Iraq is the priority.

___

May 2009: As fighting in Afghanistan intensifies, the number of U.S. troops surpasses 50,000.

___

December 2009: Troops now number more than 67,000, and the situation is deteriorating, with escalating violence and more service members killed. Obama orders in another 33,000 troops to battle al-Qaida militants and a resurgent Taliban.

___

August 2010: The U.S. force reaches 100,000.

___

May 2011: Bin Laden is found hiding in neighboring Pakistan and killed in a U.S. special operations raid. There are still about 100,000 troops in Afghanistan.

___

June 2011: Saying the U.S. is meeting its goals in Afghanistan, Obama announces his withdrawal plan: Bring home 10,000 troops by the end of 2011, and continue at a steady pace until handing over security responsibilities to the Afghans by 2014.

___

September 2012: Troop levels down to 77,000.

___

December 2013: Down to 46,000 troops, the slow withdrawal continues.

___

March 2014: With nearly 34,000 troops in Afghanistan, Obama orders the Pentagon to develop options for a complete military withdrawal, because Afghan President Hamid Karzai refuses to sign a security agreement with the United States.

___

May 2014: Obama announces his plan to pull virtually all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016, when his second term in office will be drawing to a close.

___

December 2014: Troop levels have been cut in half since Obama's announcement in May, down to 16,100. Obama declares their combat mission over, but troops will continue training and advising Afghan forces.

___

March 2015: Troops decline to their current number — about 9,800 — on track for a 2016 withdrawal.

___

Oct. 15, 2015: In a reversal, Obama says the situation is too fragile for the American military to leave. He announces plans to keep the current force of about 9,800 in place through most of next year to continue counterterrorism missions and advise Afghans battling a resurgent Taliban. The plan is for the number to decrease to about 5,500 troops in 2017.

That year, the next president will move into the White House.
