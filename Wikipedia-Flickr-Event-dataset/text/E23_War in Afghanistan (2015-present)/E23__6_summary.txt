And even if the Uighur detainees were focused solely on attacking China, the US would be wrong to condone their cause.
Five of the 22 Uighur detainees have reportedly been released in Albania, since no other country would take them.
Not only did Mahsum run the ETIM, to which all of the Uighur detainees have been tied, but he also had direct dealings with at least some of the Uighur detainees.
The Uighur detainee’s ties to the ETIM’s senior leadership is particularly troubling given the ETIM’s and Abdul Haq’s continued operations.
According to some accounts, the brain behind the threat made against the Olympic Games and the ETIM’s ongoing operations is Abdul Haq – the same man who once trained the Uighur detainees at Gitmo.
