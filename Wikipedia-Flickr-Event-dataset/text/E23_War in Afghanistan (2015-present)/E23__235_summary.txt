Michael Fallon says soldiers – part of support mission left behind after combat withdrawal – will remain for another year amid escalating Taliban attacksThe 450 troops Britain has stationed in Afghanistan are to remain for another year amid deteriorating security in the country.
David Cameron withdrew all combat troops in 2014 after 13 years of fighting the Taliban, but the support mission stayed on to train domestic forces.
In a statement to parliament, Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, confirmed the troops would remain throughout 2016.
Fallon said UK forces were only performing non-combat roles, including mentoring instructors at the Afghan National Army Officer Academy.
The Taliban have made gains since the winding down of US and UK operations.
