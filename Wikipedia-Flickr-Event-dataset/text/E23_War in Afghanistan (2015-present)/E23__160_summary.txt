U.S.: Raids have taken out 900 Taliban leadersU.S.-led military forces have captured or killed more than 900 Taliban leaders in the past 10 months, making it harder for the insurgency to maintain its offensive capabilities, according to the U.S. military in Afghanistan.
The raids have netted insurgent leaders, weapons and drugs used to finance actions against coalition forces, NATO says.
â€¢On Feb. 24, troops in Kandahar captured two Taliban leaders who had supplied insurgents with weapons.
Raids on Taliban leaders began more than a year ago under Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who was the top commander in Afghanistan until he resigned last June.
Dressler said that thousands of Taliban insurgents remain in Afghanistan and Pakistan despite the raids and that it is difficult to say whether the loss of 900 leaders will have significance on the battlefield.
