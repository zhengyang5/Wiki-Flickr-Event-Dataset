So American officials need to define what role American and NATO forces might play then.
An important question for the NATO mission after 2014 is what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise.
It is generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters.
NATO forces rely heavily on airpower for airstrikes, supply and medical evacuation since Afghanistanâ€™s roads are poor and often seeded with bombs.
Senior Afghan military officials are well aware of their deficiencies and are counting on American support.
