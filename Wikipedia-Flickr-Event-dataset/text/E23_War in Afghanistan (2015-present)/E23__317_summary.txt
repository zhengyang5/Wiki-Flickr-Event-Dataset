The White House is weighing a proposal to send between 3,000 to 5,000 more troops to Afghanistan to deal with the deteriorating security situation there, with both the Taliban and Islamic State increasingly active in parts of the country.
With NATO leaders expected to match Washington’s proposed force increases, as many as 10,000 new allied troops may be heading to Afghanistan just as the longest conflict in American history enters its 16th year.
Officials from Washington and Baghdad confirmed the talks to allow American troops to remain in several bases in Baghdad, as well as positions along the Syrian border and near the ISIS-held city of Mosul, the AP reported Thursday.
Since the U.S. combat mission ended in 2014, Afghan forces have managed to secure control just over 60 percent of the country.
“More conventional forces that would thicken the ability to advise and assist Afghan forces, that would absolutely be to our benefit,” Gen. Thomas said.
