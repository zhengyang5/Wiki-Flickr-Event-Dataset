ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 18 (UPI) -- The Pakistani military has more troops deployed along the volatile border with Afghanistan than do international forces, the government said Thursday.
Pakistani government data show the military has around 140,000 troops manning the border with Afghanistan to monitor militant activity.
Pakistani border checkpoints number 821, compared with 112 from coalition forces, Pakistani newspaper The Nation reports.
Pakistani military officials last week met with U.S. Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal as U.S. and international forces prepared to sweep into the southern Afghan province of Helmand to take on Taliban insurgents.
The data information marks the first time the Pakistani military released official figures regarding its fight against insurgents since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
