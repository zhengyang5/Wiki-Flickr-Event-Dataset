In Afghanistan, a multifront Taliban offensive this summer has raised serious questions about the ability of the Afghan security forces to keep the insurgency at bay as they suffer soaring casualty rates and continue to struggle with logistical problems.
Yet despite the rapid changes, some analysts say the security pact may still offer Afghanistan a different path, helping to solidify the countryâ€™s political dispensation and create the underpinnings necessary to avoid state collapse.
After signing the pact in Kabul, the American ambassador, James B. Cunningham, firmly embraced Hanif Atmar, the new Afghan security adviser, who signed for his country.
Mr. Ghani has signaled a willingness to reverse that stance.
In his inauguration speech on Monday, Mr. Ghani called on the Taliban to join peace talks.
