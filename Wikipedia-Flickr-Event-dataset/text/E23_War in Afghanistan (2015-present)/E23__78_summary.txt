Schroen’s memoir is mostly a straightforward account of his role leading the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team (NALT) from mid-September to the end of October 2001.
Ultimately, the NALT left for Afghanistan without the special forces representa­tive they had hoped to include.
The first special forces team reached the Panjshir Valley on 17 October, nearly a month after the NALT’s arrival.
More special forces units soon followed, joining other CIA teams already in country.
