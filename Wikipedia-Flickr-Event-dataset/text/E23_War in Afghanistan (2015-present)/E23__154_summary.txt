With almost all ballots counted, preliminary results released earlier this week gave Hamid Karzai, the incumbent president, 54 per cent of votes.
Based on preliminary results, more than 400,000 ballots for Karzai would have to be annulled to require a second round.
Pro-Karzai votesMost of the discarded polling stations were in areas where pro-Karzai voting was particularly visible.
Fifty-one of the 83 polling stations with alleged fraud were found in southern Kandahar, which is Karzai's home province but also a Taliban stronghold.
Western powers originally praised the election, but confidence in the handling of the vote has eroded as allegations of fraud have continued to mount.
