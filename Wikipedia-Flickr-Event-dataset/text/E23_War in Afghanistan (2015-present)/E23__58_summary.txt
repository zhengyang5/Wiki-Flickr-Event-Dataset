In May 1997 the Taliban launched another offensive on Mazar-i Sharif.
However, a large number of Taliban forces were reportedly gunned down in the streets by the Hazara Hizb-i Wahdat.
6 Hizb-i Islami and Jamiat-Islami fought bitter battles for years before the fall of the Najibullah government.
In February of that year, Massoud crushed an attempt by the Hizb-i Wahdat to take Kabul.
By 1996, Hekmatyar had lost much support and credibility, and a number of his Hizb-i Islami commanders had defected tothe Taliban.
