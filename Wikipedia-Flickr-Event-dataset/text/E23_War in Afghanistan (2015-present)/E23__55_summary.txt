The symbolic ceremony marked the end of the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force, which will transition to a supporting role with 13,500 soldiers, most of them American, starting Jan. 1.
"Resolute Support will serve as the bedrock of an enduring partnership" between NATO and Afghanistan, Campbell told an audience of Afghan and international military officers and officials, as well as diplomats and journalists.
He paid tribute to the international and Afghan troops who have died fighting the insurgency, saying: "The road before us remains challenging but we will triumph."
The United States spent more than $100 million on reconstruction in Afghanistan, on top of the $1 trillion war.
This has also been a deadly year for Afghanistan's security forces - army, paramilitary and police - with around 5,000 deaths recorded so far.
