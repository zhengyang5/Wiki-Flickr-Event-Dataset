Commitment Will Live On in AfghanistanSpecial to American Forces Press ServiceKABUL, Afghanistan, Jan. 21, 2007  The outgoing commander of Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan said the United States is committed to NATO’s success in Afghanistan and will remain the single largest contributor of troops to the mission.
NATO’s success is the U.S.’s success, which is Afghanistan’s success,” said Army Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry, commander of the U.S.-led Coalition since May 2005.
Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, or CSTC-A, the other two-star U.S. command, is charged with training and mentoring the Afghan National Security Forces.
Army Gen. John Abizaid, U.S. Central Command commander, presented CFC-A with the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, its third since the command was created in October 2003.
