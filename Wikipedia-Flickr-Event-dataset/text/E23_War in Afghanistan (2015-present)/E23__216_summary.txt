American forces are expected to switch to a support role, slightly earlier than originally scheduled, as Afghan troops take the security lead.
"Starting this spring, our troops will have a different mission - training, advising, assisting Afghan forces," Mr Obama said in remarks at the White House on Friday, as Mr Karzai stood alongside.
Mr Karzai said he was "very happy" to hear that Afghan forces would take over responsibility for providing security by this spring.
Also on Friday, Mr Karzai confirmed he would step down from the presidency, as expected, at the end of his term in 2014.
