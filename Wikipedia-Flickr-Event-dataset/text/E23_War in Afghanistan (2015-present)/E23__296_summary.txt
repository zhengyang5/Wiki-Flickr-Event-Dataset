Insurgents almost overran the symbolic battleground in December but army sources sceptical that Afghan forces can hold them off indefinitelyThe Taliban are inching closer to capturing Sangin district as the militants intensify their prolonged assault on government forces in Afghanistanâ€™s pivotal Helmand province.
After the insurgents almost overran the district in December, the Afghan army and police sent reinforcements to stave them off.
Since last summer, the Taliban have performed a slow, sustained pincer movement around the capital, Lashkar Gah, gaining ground in all surrounding districts.
Haji Daud, a tribal elder who recently fled Sangin to Lashkar Gah, confirmed there had been large-scale attacks against government forces over the past few days.
In other parts of the province, US forces have joined their Afghan counterparts on the ground in fending off the Taliban.
