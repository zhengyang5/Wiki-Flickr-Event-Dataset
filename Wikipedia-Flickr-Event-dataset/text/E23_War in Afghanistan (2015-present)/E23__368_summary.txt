Afghan government officials say the death toll has jumped to 140 following Friday's assault on an army base in the northern Balkh province.
"Our fighters have inflicted heavy casualties on the Afghan army stationed there," he said.
Several hundred people would come in from other places, as well," an Afghan national who serves in the army told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.
Otherwise, how can someone attack a large military base with such heavy security?"
The base in Balkh is home to the Afghan army's 209th Corps, as well as to a contingent from the German army.
