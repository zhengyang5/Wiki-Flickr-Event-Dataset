Civilian deaths in the Afghanistan conflict surged 24 percent in the first half of 2009, according to a new report from the United Nations.
The UN said it was a "significant shift" from the first half of 2007, when insurgent groups killed 298 civilians and US and allied forces killed 265.
Nevertheless, the absolute number of civilians killed by both sides continued to rise.
And a new Taliban "code of conduct" manual purportedly from Mullah Omar tells insurgents to take "the utmost effort" to avoid civilian casualties.
The indiscriminate nature of IEDs make civilian casualties inevitable, but in some cases civilians appear to be specific targets.
