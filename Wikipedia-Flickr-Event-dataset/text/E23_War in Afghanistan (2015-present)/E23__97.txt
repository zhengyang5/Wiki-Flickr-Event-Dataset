Military Operations

Royal Marines have cleared a Taliban base, consisting of 25 compounds, near the Kajaki hydroelectric dam, in an effort to help bring stability and power to Afghanistan.

Once fully operational the dam will bring electricity to 1.8 million people. But the area around Kajaki, northern Helmand Province, has been the site of regular insurgent mortar attacks over the past two months and civilians have been forced from their homes leaving the dam largely unservicable.

The recent clearance was part of an ongoing operation to create a safe-zone around the dam and allow engineers to re-enter the area and bring the dam back up to full power.

Sayed Rasul, the dam's manager and senior engineer, said:

"The dam needs a lot of maintenance and another turbine in order for it to work more efficiently. Once this happens and the local surrounding area is safer the dam will provide electricity for millions of local Afghans and create jobs for thousands."

Troops from M Company, 42 Commando, have been based in the area of Kajaki clearing compounds for the past six weeks. They regularly receive enemy small arms fire, mortars and rockets from insurgents firing from the villages surrounding Kajaki.

Operation Volcano was mounted to clear insurgents from firing points in the village of Barikju, north of Kajaki.

Surveillance over the past two months had observed numerous enemy forces conducting sentries in two main positions with an administration area to the rear. The village of Barikju is completely deserted except for insurgent forces.

Using the cover of darkness, M Company, with elements of 59 Commando Royal Engineers, Arms Explosives Search Teams and Royal Engineer Search Teams in support, moved into the area of Barikju.
