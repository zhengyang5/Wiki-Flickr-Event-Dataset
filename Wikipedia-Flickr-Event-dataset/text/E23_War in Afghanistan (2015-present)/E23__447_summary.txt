The claim that Israel's official refusal to co-operate with the UN Fact-Finding commission is to blame is highly dubious, as previous commissions raised by the United Nations usually ostracized every Israeli military action, even when carried out in undisputed self defense.
The report concludes that the Israeli military operation was directed at the people of Gaza as a whole.
Even Israeli human rights organizations called upon the Israeli Government “to take the one-sided Goldstone report seriously and to refrain from automatically rejecting its findings or denying its legitimacy”.
During the conflict, the IDF allowed huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza, the IDF unilaterally announced a daily three-hour cease fire.
All these actions were totally disregarded by the media and the UN Goldstone Commission!
