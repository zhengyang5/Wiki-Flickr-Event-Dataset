Since Afghan forces took over the battle against the Taliban, they have been steadily losing ground in Helmand.
However, the record of Afghan forces here has not been good.
Sangin was the scene of some of the fiercest fighting British forces have experienced for decades.
This battle will be decisive in terms of the conflict in Helmand, one senior US officer told me privately.
If the Afghan assault succeeds it will be evidence that the Afghan Army is indeed becoming a more effective fighting force.
