In January, when the first accounts of the Yakaolang killings trickled out of Afghanistan, the Taliban vigorously denied them.
Spokesmen for Annan and Robinson said yesterday the United Nations still aims to more fully investigate the Yakaolang killings, but has been stymied by the Taliban.
"There have been 15 massacres of civilians over the last four years,Â” said one of the UN officials.
The targeting of the Shiite Hazaras in the Yakaolang killings was nothing new.
That massacre was seen as reprisal for a 1997 massacre by Hazaras of an estimated 2,000 Taliban fighters who had surrendered in a battle at Mazar-i-Sharif.
