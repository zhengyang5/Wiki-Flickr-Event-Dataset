THE CROSSROADS OF CONFLICT THE CROSSROADS OF CONFLICT Landlocked and in the center of Asia, Afghanistan for centuries has stood as a buffer among competing empires and a focal point of trade and migration. It also has been a target of invading armies from the ancient Greeks to the modern Soviet Union, often with bloody consequences for would-be conquerors. In its history: Alexander the Great marched into the area now known as Afghanistan part of it known in ancient times as Bactria in 329 B.C. In a brutal and inconclusive war, the invaders pillaged and massacred while tribal warlords retreated to the mountains and responded with attacks. Genghis Khan and his Mongol armies invaded what is modern Afghanistan in the early 13th century, depopulating major cities and forcing much of the population back to farming and cattle breeding. Great Britain, worried about the Russian empire's expansion in central Asia, launched the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1838 and tried to set up a puppet regime there. Attacks on British forces prompted a retreat from Kabul in 1842. After the Third Anglo-Afghan war, the British relinquished control of Afghan's foreign affairs in 1919. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to crush an uprising against a pro-Moscow government. In a Cold War response, the United States helped arm Afghan rebels, the mujahedin. The war-weary Soviets withdrew their troops a decade later, in 1989.

Obama's war: Deploying 17,000 raises stakes in Afghanistan WASHINGTON  Barack Obama, whose presidential ambitions were launched by his opposition to one war, moved Tuesday to expand the U.S. deployment in another. In his first such action as president, Obama ordered an additional 17,000 combat troops to Afghanistan. His administration cast the move as an interim step to battle the resurgent Taliban, secure Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, increase security for summer elections and stem the decline in a war that the United States now risks losing. More forces may follow: Gen. David McKiernan, who commands U.S. and NATO troops there, has asked for a total of 30,000 additional troops. That would nearly double the U.S. force. Obama has ordered a broad-scale review of strategy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan — due back in about six weeks — before settling on a course ahead for the long term. Officials say he will revamp goals and lower U.S. expectations in a conflict that has proven to be more difficult and complicated than the war in Iraq. Presidents Hamid Karzai and Obama spoke on the phone for the first time exactly four weeks after Obama's inauguration about security issues and Afghanistan's presidential elections in August, Karzai's office said Wednesday. For the new president, Afghanistan looms as a defining military conflict. Obama also is dealing with Iraq and efforts to reduce the more than 140,000 U.S. troops there now, but that war is likely to forever belong to George W. Bush in the American consciousness. Obama opposed the invasion of Baghdad and was elected partly on a promise to bring U.S. troops home. He has long called Afghanistan — where the Kabul government's limited influence in tribal areas has allowed the Taliban and al-Qaeda to regroup — the central front in the battle against terrorists. U.S. and British forces invaded Afghanistan a month after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, targeting the al-Qaeda terrorists who planned the attacks and the fundamentalist Taliban regime that sheltered them in Afghanistan. Within five weeks, Kabul had fallen, and the focus of the Bush administration soon shifted to Iraq. Now, however, the U.S.-backed government in Kabul led by Hamid Karzai has failed to extend control over much of the country, the economy is in tatters, and the Taliban are back. "The Taliban is resurgent in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda supports the insurgency and threatens America from its safe haven along the Pakistani border," Obama said in a written statement Tuesday. "This increase (in troops) is necessary to stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, which has not received the strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires." The White House released its one-page announcement in late afternoon on a day when Obama's appearances were about the economy. He signed the $787 billion stimulus package at a ceremony in Denver, then flew to Phoenix to announce Wednesday the outlines of a plan targeting the mortgage meltdown. The economic downturn will continue to be the administration's top priority, but close behind will be Afghanistan — a place whose tribes defied the armies of the Mongols in the 13th century, the British in the 19th and the Soviets in the 20th. Pentagon plans assume that a significant number of U.S. troops will be deployed there through the four years of Obama's term. "He has raised the stakes pretty high for himself," says Michael O'Hanlon, a national security analyst at the Brookings Institution who last visited Afghanistan in January. "Right now, while we're optimistic about the new president and the new strategy in Afghanistan, it's easy to forget that there could come a day when we won't view this in quite the same terms, and we'll be asking ourselves, 'Why is it we have to win this war? Why is it so vital to our interests?' " As a candidate, talking tough on Afghanistan helped protect Obama from criticism that his opposition to the Iraq war reflected an unwillingness to use military muscle against America's foes. "It's pretty clear the Democratic Party has made Afghanistan symbolic of their support for combating terrorism," says political scientist Richard Eichenberg of Tufts University. The president convened the National Security Council on Friday for a final discussion of the Pentagon's troop request. The troops involved, their families and key members of Congress were notified of the decision Tuesday, and Obama called Afghan President Karzai from Air Force One en route to Denver. Under the plan, 8,000 Marines from Camp Lejeune, N.C., will be sent to Afghanistan this spring, and 4,000 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., will follow this summer. Both units had been scheduled to go to Iraq. Another 5,000 support troops will be sent as well. The deployment will "meet an urgent need for more troops in a deteriorating security situation in advance of the traditional Taliban offensives in the spring, and also leading up to ensuring secure elections later in the year," White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters aboard Air Force One. 'Clear and achievable' goals Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other officials say the 60-day review is likely to revamp the goals set for Afghanistan by former president George W. Bush. Obama's plan will focus more on providing security than trying to ensure Afghanistan is a democracy. That's a sign Bush's aspirations for establishing a stable democracy with a central government is being supplanted by ambitions within closer reach. "Clear and achievable" goals, Vice President Biden promised in a speech at a security conference in Munich last week. Even Bush's team eventually concluded "the goals we did have for Afghanistan are too broad and too far into the future," Gates, Pentagon chief for both presidents, told reporters recently. "We need more concrete goals that can be achieved realistically within three to five years." Among them: going after al-Qaeda enclaves and reducing violence against the Afghan people by the Taliban, al-Qaeda and other militant groups trying to undermine the government. Americans tend to agree on those priorities. In a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll taken Jan. 30-Feb. 1, 54% of those surveyed said the primary goal in Afghanistan should be weakening terrorists' ability to stage attacks on the United States; 30% chose building a stable democratic government. The Afghan war continues to command relatively strong public support in the U.S., especially in comparison with Iraq. By more than 2-to-1, Americans said the decision to invade Afghanistan wasn't a mistake; 56% called the invasion of Iraq a mistake. Those surveyed split evenly, however, when asked whether the U.S. should keep troops in Afghanistan until things get better, even if that takes years, or set a timetable for removing them regardless of what's going on there at that time. The lessons of Iraq Some lessons from Iraq are being applied in Afghanistan. "The most significant lesson from Iraq is that your No. 1 goal in fighting a counterinsurgency fight is to secure the civilian population in a way that's sustained," says Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, a leading hawk on both wars. "The second lesson is … you have to work with local people to develop the economy and everything else." "The principles are exactly the same," O'Hanlon says. "The details are totally different." That means not all of the U.S. tactics in Iraq translate to Afghanistan. Former U.N. ambassador Richard Holbrooke, now on his way home after a tour of the region as Obama's special representative, predicted: "It's going to be much tougher than Iraq." Among the differences: •An unforgiving geography. Iraq is mostly desert. Afghanistan is dominated by mountains, some too rugged and high for trucks or helicopters to operate in. A labyrinth of mountain paths provides sanctuaries for insurgents and easy passage across the Pakistani border. •A lack of leaders. Fewer than one in three Afghan adults can read and write. In comparison, three of four Iraqi adults are literate, and even under Saddam Hussein there was an established bureaucracy. Afghanistan hasn't had that in decades. "Where is the human capital to occupy governmental positions, to be leaders, to be mayors, to run budgets, to contract labor, to be the civil administration of the country?" McKiernan asked in a December interview in Kabul. •A profusion of tribes. There are 400 major tribes or subdivisions of tribes across the country and, traditionally, local tribal leaders have more power than whoever is in charge in Kabul. Conflicts among tribes complicate the job of U.S. forces. •More opium than oil. Iraq has annual oil revenue of more than $7 billion, providing a source of national wealth and a way to finance economic development and a middle class. In Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, the growth industry is illegal drugs. It is the world's largest opium producer. Drug profits help finance the Taliban and other insurgents and contribute to rampant government corruption. •A secondary U.S. commitment. Since the Iraq invasion, the United States has sent far more troops and spent much more money on that conflict than in Afghanistan. Even with Obama's planned deployment, three times more U.S. troops will be on duty in Iraq than in Afghanistan. The Iraq war "diverted huge amounts of resources from Afghanistan and Pakistan," says Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who is on the Armed Services Committee. Balancing the U.S. commitment between Iraq and Afghanistan almost certainly will cause strains. Gen. David Petraeus, chief of the U.S. Central Command, has expressed concern about pulling out troops too quickly as a still-fragile Iraq prepares for elections at year's end, but more U.S. troops won't be available for Afghanistan unless they're not sent to Iraq. Afghans themselves aren't optimistic that Obama is going to succeed in turning things around, according to a poll taken in December and January and sponsored by ABC News, the BBC and ARD German TV. Two in 10 say Obama will make things better for their country; nearly as many think he'll make things worse. Views of the United States have darkened, too: 83% had a favorable opinion of the United States in 2005, now 47% do; 52% see the U.S. unfavorably. "You are now losing the war in Afghanistan," says Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic & International Studies, who briefed Democratic congressional leaders last month. "If you don't make changes, you're going to see Afghanistan effectively come under Taliban and warlord control, and you seriously risk the stability of Pakistan." Despite the U.S. buildup, McKiernan said in December that the day when Afghans are able to manage government and security operations wasn't yet in sight. "We're at least there or four years away from, perhaps, that tipping point," he said, adding: "2009 will be another tough fight."
