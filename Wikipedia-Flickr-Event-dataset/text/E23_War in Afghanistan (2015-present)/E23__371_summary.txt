The Taliban launched an attack on Ghazni City and destroyed the governor’s compound over the weekend.
Additionally, the Taliban claimed it took control of Waghaz district and is threatening to overrun Dih Yak.
“Dih Yak centre and provincial centers [Ghazni City] under attack,” he noted in a separate tweet.
Taliban forces entered Kunduz City earlier this month and took control of Qala-i-Zal district, but were pushed back by Afghan forces.
Kunduz City has fallen under Taliban control twice for short periods of time since the fall of 2015.
