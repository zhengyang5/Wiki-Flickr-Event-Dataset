Senior U.S. and NATO commanders in Kabul say Afghan forces will soon begin to take the lead in some combat operations, but will continue to need substantial allied support.
The plan to transfer security responsibility to Afghan forces is the centerpiece of U.S. President Barack Obama's revised Afghanistan strategy.
"Taking the lead" means involvement in planning and being in a lead position in operations, but it is still far from operating independently.
It also involves bringing Afghan officers into General Rodriguez's new operations center, where visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke on Wednesday.
General Rodriguez says having such a date is forcing Afghan and international officials to focus more intently on key areas, like the building of the Afghan forces.
