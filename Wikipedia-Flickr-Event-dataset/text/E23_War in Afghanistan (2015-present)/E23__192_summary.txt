The United States presence in Afghanistan received another political black eye on Wednesday after The Los Angeles Times published photographs apparently showing United States soldiers posing with body parts of dead insurgents.
Reacting quickly, a wide assortment of American officials, all the way up to President Obama, condemned the actions.
Then in February, word that NATO personnel had burned an undisclosed number of Korans at Bagram Air Base set off deadly riots.
In March, the mass killing of Afghan villagers by a rogue American soldier in Kandahar Province further strained the Afghan-American relationship.
A spokeswoman for international forces in Afghanistan told Mr. Bowley and Ms. Rubin that she believed the photographs were taken in 2010.
