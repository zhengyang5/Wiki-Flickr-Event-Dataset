At least 39 Islamic State, or IS, members were killed and 15 others wounded in clashes with Afghan troops on Wednesday in eastern Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, considered an insurgent stronghold.
The IS members, including Commander Qari Yusif, were killed when they attacked several police checkpoints in Nangarhar, the Afghan army's media department said in a Twitter post.
Provincial police spokesman Hazrat Hussain Mashriqwal told EFE the clashes occurred in Kot district, but only 28 IS members had been confirmed killed.
Official figures show that at least 1,979 suspected militants were killed, 736 others wounded and 965 detained between April 2015 and March 2016 by the army, police and intelligence agencies in Nangarhar with the help of U.S. troops.
Islamic State has been active in at least four provinces in eastern and southern Afghanistan for about a year, and NATO estimates the group has between 1,000 and 3,000 members in the country, most of whom are concentrated in a few districts in Nangarhar.
