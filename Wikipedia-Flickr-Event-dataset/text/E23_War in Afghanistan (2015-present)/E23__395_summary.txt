The number killed rose by 8% last year – the fifth consecutive rise – with a further 4,507 civilians wounded, the UN report said.
Many were killed by roadside bombs or in suicide attacks, with Taliban-affiliated militants responsible for three-quarters of the deaths.
The figures come as Nato begins to map out plans for international troops to withdraw and hand over responsibility for security to Afghan security forces.
They were also relying more on roadside bombs and suicide attacks in places like bazaars, school grounds, footpaths and bus stations.
The number of roadside bombs planted last year overwhelmed security forces' improved ability to detect and defuse them.
