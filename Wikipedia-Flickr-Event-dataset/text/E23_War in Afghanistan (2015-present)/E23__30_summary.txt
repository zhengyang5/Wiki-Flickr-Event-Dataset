The Pentagon offered no immediate explanation for what caused the deadliest "friendly fire" incident of the war.
Karzai's forces are one of two opposition groups attacking the last remaining concentration of Taliban forces in Kandahar, the militia's spiritual home in southern Afghanistan.
The Pentagon last night identified the three American soldiers killed in the friendly fire incident as Master Sgt.
All were from the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Special Forces Group, based at Fort Campbell, Ky.
Marine spokesman Stewart Upton said the decision to prevent reporters from observing the casualties was made by Marine commanders at the air base here.
