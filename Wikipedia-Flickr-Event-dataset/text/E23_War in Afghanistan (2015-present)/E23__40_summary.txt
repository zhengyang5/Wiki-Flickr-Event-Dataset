HONOLULU (AP) â€” President Barack Obama says the longest war in American history is coming to a responsible conclusion.
The war came to a formal end Sunday with a ceremony in Kabul.
Obama is also honoring the more than 2,200 Americans who have died in Afghanistan since the war started 13 years ago.
Now, thanks to the extraordinary sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, our combat mission in Afghanistan is ending, and the longest war in American history is coming to a responsible conclusion.
But compared to the nearly 180,000 American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan when I took office, we now have fewer than 15,000 in those countries.
