On other fronts, Mr. Obama and Mr. Karzai reported some progress.
Even after that transition, Americans will still fight alongside the Afghan troops when needed, but the Americans will focus on training, advising and assisting their Afghan counterparts, Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Karzai supported this change, saying that it would allow American troops to stop patrolling Afghan villages.
Mr. Obama sounded as though he intends to keep enough there to carry out what he described as “a very limited mission” of training Afghan forces and hunting down remnants of Al Qaeda .
Mr. Karzai reportedly has been counting on a force of 15,000, but that seems unlikely and strikes us as far too high.
