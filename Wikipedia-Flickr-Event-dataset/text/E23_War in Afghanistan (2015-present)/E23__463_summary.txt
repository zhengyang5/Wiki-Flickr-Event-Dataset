Government losing support for Afghanistan campaignUpdatedAustralian support for a continued military presence in Afghanistan has significantly dwindled in the latest wide-reaching poll conducted by the international policy think tank, the Lowy Institute.
The flagging support for the international campaign against terrorism is mirrored in the results of a second poll released today.
That may be one reason why support for Australia's military involvement in Afghanistan has slid.
In Pakistan, 22 per cent of people believe Al Qaeda is winning the war.
"The majority of people in all 23 out of 24 countries believe that it has either made Al Qaeda stronger or has had no effect on Al Qaeda," Mr Miller added.
