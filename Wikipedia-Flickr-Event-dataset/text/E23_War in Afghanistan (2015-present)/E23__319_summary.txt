I went to the local school and lots of my friends ended up as jihadi fighters, some have even joined IS.
But joining a jihadi group isn't unusual around here, in fact it is a kind of career choice.
In July 2014 I met one of the organisers of Da'esh in Afghanistan.
In July last year they got into conflict with the local Taliban and one of their top leaders.
Lots of them were once Taliban fighters but it is very hard for them to go back.
