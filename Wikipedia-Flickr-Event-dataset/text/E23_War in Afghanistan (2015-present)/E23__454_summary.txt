Global Unease With Major World PowersRising Environmental Concern in 47-Nation SurveySummary of FindingsA 47-nation survey finds global public opinion increasingly wary of the world’s dominant nations and disapproving of their leaders.
There is little evidence that discontent with the major nations of the world and their leaders is resulting in greater confidence in those who have challenged the global status quo.
As was the case in Pew’s first major global survey in 2002, global concerns vary significantly by region of the world.
In Indonesia, positive opinions of Americans have fallen from 65% in 2002 to 42%; in Turkey, favorable opinions have declined 19 points.
Similarly, in most parts of the world, majorities report liking American music, movies and television.
