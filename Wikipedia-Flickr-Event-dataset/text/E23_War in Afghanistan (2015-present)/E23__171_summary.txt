Brevity is the hallmark of military reporting, but even by those standards the description of one disastrous event is remarkably short: "The patrol returned to base."
None of this, however, was captured in the initial military account, written by the marines themselves.
It simply says that, simultaneous to the suicide explosion, "the patrol received small arms fire from three directions".
Two hours later Americans returned to the scene of the bombing to conduct an "exploitation of the blast site with pictures/grid cords as well as debriefing ANP leadership on scene".
The logs report that nine hours after the shooting, the governor of Nangarhar province appealed to the marines to stay at home.
