ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Suspected militants attacked a truck depot in Peshawar near the border with the Khyber Agency in the country's restive tribal areas, destroying NATO supply trucks bound for Afghanistan, Peshawar police said.
Firefighters extinguish smouldering trucks after a recent attack on a Peshawar terminal.
It was the fifth attack on NATO supply lines through Pakistan since November.
One of those attacks took place November 11, when as many as 200 Taliban fighters hijacked a convoy carrying NATO supplies from Karachi to Afghanistan via the border at Peshawar.
Meanwhile, the Taliban militant accused of masterminding that attack, Mustafa Kamal, was arrested Thursday night in Peshawar, security sources said.
