KABUL (Reuters) - Commercial flights to Afghanistan’s besieged northern city of Kunduz have been suspended, an official said on Thursday, as hundreds of Taliban militants fought against government forces struggling to oust them from the city’s outskirts.
Afghan security forces patrol at the Kunduz, Afghanistan April 30, 2015.
Government forces have vowed that the northern provincial capital will not fall into the hands of the Taliban, who officials said were fighting alongside foreign jihadists.
The fighting prompted Afghan airline East Horizons to suspend its once-weekly flight from Kabul to Kunduz, the only commercial passenger air link to the northern city.
“We haven’t found any evidence that Daesh is involved in the Kunduz fighting,” he said.
