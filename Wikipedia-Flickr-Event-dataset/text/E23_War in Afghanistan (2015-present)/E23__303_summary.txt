There are fears that Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan, could fall to the Taliban.
The Taliban effectively control or contest 10 of the 14 districts in Helmand, the deadliest province for British and US forces in Afghanistan over the past decade.
If it takes Lashkar Gah, it would be the second provincial capital it has captured since being toppled in a US-led military campaign 15 years ago.
An Afghan security official in Kabul confirmed the existence of the new Taliban unit in Helmand, but played down its impact on the battlefield.
"We remain confident that the Afghan forces are fighting effectively and that they will continue to secure Lashkar Gah."
