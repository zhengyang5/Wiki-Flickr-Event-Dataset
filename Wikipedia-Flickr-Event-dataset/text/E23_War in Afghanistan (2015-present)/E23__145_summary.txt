One Marine has been killed and several others were wounded in Operation Khanjar - or "Strike of the Sword - in the Helmand Province, a Taliban stronghold.
Some 4,000 American troops and 650 Afghan soldiers set out in helicopters and Humvees under cover of darkness to clear the region.
Despite the early casualties, military commanders said they have seen only sporadic resistance during the operation, which took place in 100-plus degreeweather.
The number of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan is expected to reach 68,000 by year's end - double the number in 2008.
The operation supports U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal's strategy to focus on securing the Afghan people with the hope they reject Taliban influence.
