The death toll of British troops in southern Afghanistan rose to 184 last week as a switch of military strategy brought more bloodshed.
On Friday morning five British troops died in double blasts as they patrolled south of the town.
Three other British soldiers were killed on Thursday and Friday, bringing the total to 15 in 10 days.
The police are "the face of the Afghan government" and thus "the strategic hope", British senior officers say.
The house was that of the senior Taliban commander in the area who was, predictably, away.
