REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst KABUL (Reuters) - New U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday on his first trip since taking over the job this week, saying he wanted to talk to Afghan and American officials to ensure a "lasting" success as U.S. troops withdraw.
Carter, who was sworn in on Tuesday, has suggested he would be open to slowing U.S. withdrawal plans, if necessary.
"We're looking for success in Afghanistan that is lasting, and the lasting accomplishment of our mission here,"Carter said in his first news conference since taking the job.
Senior Pakistani army, Afghan and diplomatic officials said on Thursday the Afghan Taliban had signaled they were willing to open peace talks with Kabul.
Carter's unannounced visit to Afghanistan came after the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since the war againstTaliban militants began in 2001.
