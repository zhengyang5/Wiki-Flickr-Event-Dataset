That is the highest number of munitions dropped since the Air Force began publishing data in 2012.
At that time, the US maintained over 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, many in direct combat roles, compared to 14,000 today.
US airstrikes dropped dramatically during the final years of the Obama administration as more restrictive rules governing which enemy forces could be targeted were enacted.
The US military was allowed to strike ISIS and al Qaeda, but could only target the Taliban under certain specific circumstances.
President Donald Trump removed these restrictions as part of his new strategy for Afghanistan and the wider region, allowing the US military to target Taliban forces anywhere they were found.
