The United States has expanded its fight against the Islamic State group in Afghanistan, launching 20 airstrikes in the eastern part of the country in the last three weeks, U.S. officials said Thursday.
Gen. Wilson A. Shoffner told reporters that 1,000 to 3,000 Islamic State fighters in eastern Afghanistan are trying to establish a base of operations in the rugged mountains of Nangahar Province.
In a teleconference from Afghanistan, Shoffner said that the Islamic State militants have been launching attacks in the east but don't have the ability to conduct operations at more than one location at a time.
Most of the Islamic State fighters are from other groups that are simply rebranding themselves as Islamic State, and Shoffner said many are former members of the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e Taliban.
At the war's peak, the U.S. had about 100,000 forces in Afghanistan.
