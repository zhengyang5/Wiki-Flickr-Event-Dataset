(AP)President Obama revealed his long-awaited plan for Afghanistan on Tuesday, announcing that a residual force of 9,800 U.S. troops will remain there for one year following the end of combat operations in December.
â€œObama said this week that he would leave Afghanistan in a responsible way.
Several NATO and non-NATO countries with troops in Afghanistan had said they would leave modest contingents behind for training only if the United States did so.
The United States and other international donors have agreed to spend at least $4 billion a year to support the Afghan security forces between 2015 and 2017.
Afghan security forces currently number 382,000, a level at which an administration fact sheet indicated they are likely to remain despite earlier plans to cut the total by at least a third.
