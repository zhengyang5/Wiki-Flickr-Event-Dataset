In the seven-minute video, Amedy Coulibaly is described as a “soldier of the caliphate” and is filmed declaring allegiance to the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
In the video, Coulibaly said he had coordinated his attacks with Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, the brothers who stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, killing 12 people.
DGSI phone surveillance on Chérif Kouachi was suspended at the end of 2013, and on Saïd in the summer 2014, according to the Libération newspaper.
It is not clear why surveillance was lifted on Saïd Kouachi last summer.
The video showing Coulibaly swearing allegiance gives the group the appearance of a global force.
