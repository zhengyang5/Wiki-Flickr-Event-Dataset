Muslims in France and around the world banded together on Wednesday to strongly condemn the deadliest terror attack the country has seen in the past two decades.

Three masked gunmen stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine that has become notorious for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. One of the men reportedly shouted “Allahu akbar” as they unleashed a barrage of bullets that left at least twelve dead.

Muslim leaders and activists immediately denounced the terrorists actions, reiterating the verse in the Quran that tells Muslims when one kills just one innocent person, it is as if he has killed all of humanity.

The Grand Mosque of Paris, one of the largest in France, issued a statement on its website shortly after the attacks, saying its community was "shocked" and "horrified" by the violence.

We strongly condemn these kind of acts and we expect the authorities to take the most appropriate measures. Our community is stunned by what just happened. It’s a whole section of our democracy that is seriously affected. This is a deafening declaration of war. Times have changed, and we are now entering a new era of confrontation.

The Union of Islamic Organizations of France also responded on its website, writing: “The UOIF condemns in the strongest terms this criminal attack, and these horrible murders. The UOIF expresses its deepest condolences to the families and all the employees of Charlie Weekly.”

Hassen Chalghoumi, imam of the Drancy mosque in Paris's Seine-Saint-Denis suburb, spoke with France's BFM TV and condemned the attackers, saying, "Their barbarism has nothing to do with Islam."

"I am extremely angry," Chalghoumi said. "These are criminals, barbarians. They have sold their soul to hell. This is not freedom. This is not Islam and I hope the French will come out united at the end of this."

Countless Muslim activists, leaders and authors took to social media Wednesday to express horror and dismay at the attack:

France, turning on your own Muslim citizens & "blaming Islam" for #CharlieHebdo feeds the extremists' agenda. Don't help them. — Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli) January 7, 2015

As a Muslim, killing innocent people in the name of Islam is much, much more offensive to me than any cartoon can ever be. #CharlieHebdo — Iyad El-Baghdadi (@iyad_elbaghdadi) January 7, 2015

Horrifed and saddened by attack at #CharlieHebdo. Simple as that. No political rhetoric to add right now. Just sick to my stomach. — rabia chaudry (@rabiasquared) January 7, 2015

As a Muslim, I condemn the cruel attack on #CharlieHebdo & offer condolences to the French people.

The "Islam" of the murderers is not mine. — Mustafa Akyol (@AkyolinEnglish) January 7, 2015

Sheer madness, mind boggling that people will kill over a cartoon. So far from any faith they claim to belong to. #NotInMyName — Sabbiyah Pervez (@sabbiyah) January 7, 2015

When the Nazis were rounding up French Jews to kill them the Paris Grand mosque took them in. http://t.co/1kdu1feuvp #NotInMyName — سلطان سعود القاسمي (@SultanAlQassemi) January 7, 2015

You shouted 'Allahu Akber' whilst murdering others? You are a disgrace to my religion. May the dead rest in peace #notinmyname #charliehebdo — Ali Gokal (@aligokal) January 7, 2015

Our Prophet used to pray for the person who mocked him, he NEVER killed anyone or ordered this. #FranceShooting #NotInMyName RIP the victims — ●a'ιѕнaн○ (@psLoveAishah) January 7, 2015

Response to #CharlieHebdo #ParisShooting? Neither apologetics nor xenophobia, but a robust commitment to a robust and pluralistic democracy. — omid safi (@ostadjaan) January 7, 2015

Dr. Bilal Rana, President of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, said that her organization plans to launch a letter writing campaign to openly condemn the attack:

The sanctity of human life is central to our faith. That lives could taken in this manner for any cause is appalling and unjustifiable.

Members of the Muslim Advisory Council to the NYPD "unequivocally" denounced the shooting.
