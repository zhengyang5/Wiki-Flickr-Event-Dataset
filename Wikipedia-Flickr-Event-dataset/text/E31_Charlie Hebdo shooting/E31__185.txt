Some copies of The Hindu dated January 18, 2015, carried an image of people holding copies of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo , the cover of which might have given offence to a section of readers. The image was removed mid-way through the print-run. The Hindu regrets and apologises for the inadvertent and accidental use of the image.
