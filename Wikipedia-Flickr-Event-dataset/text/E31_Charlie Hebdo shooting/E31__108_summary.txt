The French press has raised half a million euros (£400,000) to ensure the continuation of the satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo after the twelve people were shot dead by gunmen at its offices yesterday.
€250,000 (£200,000) of the funding has been provided by the Press and Pluralism Fund, set up by French newspaper publishers to ensure a diverse media landscape.
Not only they will not succeed, but we want Charlie Hebdo emerge stronger from this tragedy," said Francis Morel, CEO of French newspaper group Les Échos.
"Faced with horror, the groups Radio France, Le Monde and France Televisions announce that Charlie Hedbo will be made available and its team will bring together all necessary means to ensure that Charlie Hebdo continues to live,” the statement said.
Around 11.30am yesterday gunmen forcibly entered the offices of the satirical magazine, where a weekly editorial meeting was taking place.
