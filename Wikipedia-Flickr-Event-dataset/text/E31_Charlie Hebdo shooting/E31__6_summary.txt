PARIS (Reuters) - A French court on Thursday ruled in favor of a satirical weekly that had printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, rejecting accusations by Islamic groups who said the publication incited hatred against Muslims.
Philippe Val, chief editor of the French satirical weekly "Charlie Hebdo", speaks with the media in Paris March 22, 2007.
A French court ruled in favour of the satirical weekly that had printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, rejecting accusations by Islamic groups who said the publication incited hatred against Muslims.
“The acceptable limits of freedom of expression have not been overstepped, with the contentious pictures participating in a public debate of general interest,” the court said.
Even if the cartoon in itself was “shocking or hurting for Muslims, there is no deliberate desire to offend them,” it said.
