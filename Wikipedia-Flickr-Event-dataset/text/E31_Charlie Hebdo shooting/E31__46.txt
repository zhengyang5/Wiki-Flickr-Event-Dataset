Slain Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier had featured on a list of people being proposed as potential targets in an al-Qaeda magazine in 2013.

Chillingly, the hitlist has reappeared on Twitter following the attack on the magazine's Paris newsroom, with a red X imposed over Charbonnier's face.

The list was originally published in a 2013 edition of Inspire , al-Qaeda's leading English-speaking magazine, under the heading "Wanted, dead or alive for crimes against Islam."

The updated list began surfacing on Twitter within hours of the Paris attack, shared by Twitter accounts commonly used for al-Qaeda propaganda.
