A surge in violence follows Wednesday's massacre at the Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which had published controversial cartoons depicting the Muslim Prophet Muhammad.
The latest reported explosion erupted early Thursday near a mosque in the eastern French town of Villefranche-sur-Sa√¥ne, about 250 miles from the French capital.
The blast occurred at around 6 a.m. local time (midnight ET) and destroyed the glass front of a cafe attached to the building, Lyon-based newspaper Le Progres reported.
The shots occurred one hour after the end of prayers.
France's Ministry of Interior wouldn't confirm or comment on any of the reported mosque attacks, saying local police were handling the cases.
