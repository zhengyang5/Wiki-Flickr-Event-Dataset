Thousands of people have marched in the Russian region of Chechnya to rally against the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
Ramzan Kadyrov, the Putin loyalist who runs the region, told the crowd “Western agents” probably organized the Charlie Hebdo killings to trigger a “new wave” of Islamic State recruits for their war on Islam.
Kadyrov, 38, has said the U.S. secretly controls the Islamic State.
At least three “emirs” in the North Caucasus have pledged allegiance to the movement in the past few months.
In November, Kadyrov said the Islamic State commander known as Omar the Chechen had been killed in Syria after threatening to strike Russia.
