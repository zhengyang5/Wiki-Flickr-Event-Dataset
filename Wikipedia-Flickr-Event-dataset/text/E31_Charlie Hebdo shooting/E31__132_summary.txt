Following the killing of twelve journalists at the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris on Wednesday, mourners congregated at two separate vigils in central Brussels.
The first vigil took place in front of the French consulate, on Boulevard du RÃ©gent, starting at 6PM.
A second vigil began at 7PM, at Place du Luxembourg, opposite the European Parliament.
However, on my way back to the office, the Parliamentarium billboard, was a surprise.
Returning to the EURACTIV office, flags were noticeably at half-mast, in front of the Commission.
