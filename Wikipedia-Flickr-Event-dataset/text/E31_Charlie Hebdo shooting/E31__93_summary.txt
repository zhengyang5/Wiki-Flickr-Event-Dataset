The employee -- a 26-year-old graphic designer named Lilian, according to a source close to the investigation -- was "terrified", Molin said.
Another source said the hidden employee was also able to communicate with a family member via text.
The father and son quickly hid in the supermarket's refrigeration unit, two relatives told AFP.
Hidden in the cold, they and the other hostages remained in the refrigerator for nearly five hours.
Meanwhile, in Dammartin-en-Goele, as police launched their assault on the printing works, an armoured car gave them access to the upper floor to free the hidden employee, a source said.
