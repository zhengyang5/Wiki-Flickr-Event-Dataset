LifeNews, a mainstream Russian TV news channel, aired a segment on Thursday in which a regular guest and "expert political analyst" stated that the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris had in fact been carried out by United States intelligence agencies.
Martynov also argued that the attack was meant to pressure French President Francois Hollande into maintaining Western economic sanctions against Russia.
The network announced the segment in a tweet reading, "Political analyst Alexei Martynov: Terrorist attack in Paris staged by US intelligence agencies."
He has also been quoted by The Nation as an expert on United States foreign policy.
Marynov further argued that the United States is seeking to heighten European fears of terrorism, thus making European leaders reliant on US counterterrorism and cementing American hegemony over Europe.
