Beyond its effects on the media and free speech, the Charlie Hebdo attack could not have come at a worse time in Europe.
Amid growing anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic sentiment across the continent, Wednesday’s bloodbath is likely to lessen the quality of European democracy.
European policymakers, media and people must work to ensure that this assault doesn’t lead to countermeasures and scapegoating of French and European Muslims.
In Germany, for example, refugees, including those fleeing Islamic fundamentalists in Syria, have been bombed and smeared with swastikas.
Most European societies are only now beginning to recognize Islam and the growing number of Muslims in their midst.
