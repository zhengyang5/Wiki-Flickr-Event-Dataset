One of the police officers killed in the terrorist attack today in Paris has been identified as 42-year-old Ahmed Merabet.
The attack began around 11:30 a.m. local time when three men entered the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
The men claimed that they were members of an Al-Qaeda faction in Yemen and were avenging the Prophet Muhammad.
Two officers were shot during the attack, one of them at a distance as the gunmen fled.
A masked man then approached the officer while he was lying on the ground and shot him at extremely close range.
