The salesman told France Info radio how he came face-to-face with one of the suspects holed up in the small CTD office in Dammartin-en-Goele, about half-an-hour north of the capital.
"When I arrived my client came out with an armed man who said he was from the police.
My client told me to leave so I left," Didier said, identifying the man he was to meet with as Michel.
I shook Michel's hand and I shook the hand of one of the terrorists."
The salesman told the radio station he had not recognised the man.
