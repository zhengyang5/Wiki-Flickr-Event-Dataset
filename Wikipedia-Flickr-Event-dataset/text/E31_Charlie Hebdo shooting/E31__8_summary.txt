Google has paid tribute to the 12 victims of the massacre at the offices of Charlie Hebdo with a black ribbon placed on its homepage.
The black ribbon was first seen on Google Franceâ€™s page before being added to the search engine's UK homepage.
Tributes have been paid across the world to the eight journalists, two policemen, a visitor and a maintenance worker killed in the brutal attack.
The hashtag #JesuisCharlie continues to trend after hundreds of thousands used it in messages of solidarity with those affected by the attack.
"Je Suis Charlie" translates as "I am Charlie".
