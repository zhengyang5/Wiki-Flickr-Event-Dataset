Charlie Hebdo shooting: Printing company worker's encounter with suspects Said and Cherif KouachiPostedFor Didier the salesman, a meeting with a client at a printing business outside Paris turned into a run-in with France's most wanted men as he "shook hands" with one of the Charlie Hebdo massacre suspects.
The salesman told France Inter radio how he came face to face with one of the suspects holed up in the small CTD office in Dammartin-en-Goele, about 30 minutes north of the capital.
My client told me to leave, so I left," Didier said, identifying the man he was to meet with as Michel.
Police have identified the men suspected of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices as Said Kouachi, 34, and his brother Cherif Kouachi, 32.
The salesman told the radio station he had not recognised the man.
