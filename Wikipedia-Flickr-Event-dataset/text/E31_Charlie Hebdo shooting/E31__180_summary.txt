Tim Wolff is the editor-in-chief of Germany's most popular satirical publication, Titanic, which, like Charlie Hebdo, has also published jokes about Islam and spoofs of Muslims.
DW: In light of Wednesday's attacks in Paris, are you concerned about the safety of your workers, or perhaps your own safety?
Titanic editor-in-chief Wolff told DW that satirists must forget their fearsDoes Titanic often publish satire of Islam - and when was the last instance?
Let me reiterate: If these attacks are the work of Islamists, then it makes satire even more relevant.
However, as a satirist, we are beholden to the principle that every human being has the right to be parodied.
