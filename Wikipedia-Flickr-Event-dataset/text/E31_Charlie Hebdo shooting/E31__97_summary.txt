The suspects, Cherif Kouachi, 32, and his older brother Said, 34, took refuge in a small printing warehouse in the town of Dammartin-en-Goele and, according to a town official, took at least one person hostage.
"They said they want to die as martyrs," Yves Albarello, a local lawmaker who said he was inside the police command post in the town, told French television station i-Tele.
French TV showed at least eight buses lined up outside the town in preparation for removing as many as 1,000 school children.
Xavier Castaing, the chief Paris police spokesman, said the suspects were holed up inside CTF Creation Tendance Decouverte, a printing house.
The massive manhunt came to a head earlier Friday after the suspects stole a Peugeot car, a French security official told the AP.
