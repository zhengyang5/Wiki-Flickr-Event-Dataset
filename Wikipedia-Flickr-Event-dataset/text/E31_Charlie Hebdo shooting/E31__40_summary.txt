Paris (AFP) - Heavily armed gunmen shouting Islamist slogans stormed a Paris satirical newspaper office Wednesday and shot dead at least 12 people in the deadliest attack in France in four decades.
President Francois Hollande, who immediately rushed to the scene of the shooting, described it as a barbaric terrorist attack.
"An act of exceptional barbarism has just been committed here in Paris against a newspaper, meaning (against) the expression of liberty," Hollande said at the scene.
The White House condemned the attack in the "strongest possible terms," while British Prime Minister David Cameron called it "sickening."
Despite being taken to court under anti-racism laws, the weekly continued to publish controversial cartoons of the Muslim prophet.
