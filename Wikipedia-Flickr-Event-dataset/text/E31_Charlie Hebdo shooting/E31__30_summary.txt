PARIS -- Three masked gunmen stormed the Paris offices of a satirical newspaper Wednesday, killing 12 people, including its editor, before escaping in a car.
Security forces were hunting for the gunmen who spoke flawless, unaccented French in the military-style noon-time attack on the weekly newspaper, located near Paris' Bastille monument.
Both al Qaeda and ISIS have repeatedly threatened to attack France.
Just minutes before the attack, Charlie Hebdo had tweeted a satirical cartoon of the ISIS leader giving New Year's wishes:Charlie Hebdo has been repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and other sketches.
President Obama spoke to President Hollande to express his sympathies for the attack in Paris Wednesday.
