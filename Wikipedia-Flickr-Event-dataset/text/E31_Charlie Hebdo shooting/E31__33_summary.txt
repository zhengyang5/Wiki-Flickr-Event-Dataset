A JOURNALIST says she had a gun pointed to her head at the Charlie Hebdo offices but was told she would be spared because she was a woman.
Sigolene Vinson, told Radio France Internationale, said she survived the attack at the satirical weekly magazine which killed 12 people because of her gender.
Laurent Leger, another Charlie Hebdo journalist who survived the attack, said his colleagues were laughing and initially thought sounds of gunfire was a joke.
“We thought it was a joke, that it was fire crackers,” said Mr Leger.
“They called out the name of (Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier) Charb,” he said.
