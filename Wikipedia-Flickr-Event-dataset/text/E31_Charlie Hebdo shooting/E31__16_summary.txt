Twelve people were confirmed dead after a shooting at the office of a French satirical weekly in Paris, police said on Wednesday.
A police spokesman told reporters the dead included ten journalists and two police officers, adding that five people were seriously injured.
Earlier, Luc Poignard, a police union official, said two attackers escaped in two vehicles after opening fire at Charlie Hebdo.
“About a half an hour ago two black-hooded men entered the building with Kalashnikovs (guns),” Benoit Bringer told France Info radio.
He told reporters that France had undergone “an exceptional act of barbarism committed against a newspaper” and was in “shock”.
