Two undated handout pictures released by French Police in Paris show Cherif Kouachi, left, and his brother Said Kouachi, 34, suspected in connection with the shooting attack at the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo headquarters.
We killed Charlie Hebdo," one of the men shouted in French, according to video shot from a nearby building.
Charlie Hebdo has been repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and other sketches.
Police investigators examine the impacts from machine gun fire on the front of a police vehicle near the Charlie Hebdo offices.
Philippe Val, one-time Charlie Hebdo chief, raised the possibility of publishing a special edition of the newspaper, saying "a way of speaking has been exterminated."
