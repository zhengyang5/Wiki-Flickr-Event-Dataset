Thousands of people gathered at the Place de la République in Paris for a spontaneous demonstration Wednesday against the violent attack at the satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead.
Others in the crowd held up back issues of Charlie Hebdo featuring controversial cartoons.
The subjects published by Charlie Hebdo need to be debated, it is necessary.
Our democracy has been attacked.”Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo proposed that Charlie Hebdo “be adopted as a citizen of honour” by the city.
Philippe Val, a former director of Charlie Hebdo, said he had lost all his friends in the massacre.
