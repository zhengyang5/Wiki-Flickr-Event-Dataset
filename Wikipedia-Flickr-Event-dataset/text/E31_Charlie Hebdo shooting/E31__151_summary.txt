A Belgian terrorist cell was linked to threats of violence targeting newsagents selling the latest copy of Charlie Hebdo on Friday night, according to documents found in a flat where two terror suspects were killed.
Belgian secret service agents called in the armed police raid when intelligence indicated the terror cell was about to carry out an attack.
The terrorist cell was also equipped with police uniforms, radio, false documentation and an "important sum of cash".
"What is certain is that a major attack by this terrorist cell was imminent," said Eric Van der Sypt, the spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor.
Four other people were charged along with "Marouane E" him for "participating in the activities of a terrorist group".
