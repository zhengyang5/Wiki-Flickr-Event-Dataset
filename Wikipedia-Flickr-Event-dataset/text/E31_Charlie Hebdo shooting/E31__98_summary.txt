Brothers linked to the Charlie Hebdo attack, and another gunman with ties to the two, were killed following separate hostage-takings in Paris that also left four hostages dead.
A security official said the two brothers came out firing, prompting the raid on the building where they were holed up.
That gunman was killed in the raid, along with four hostages, French President Francois Hollande confirmed in an address to the nation.
They include family members of the three suspects killed by police Friday.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls had said both suspects were known to intelligence services before the attack.
