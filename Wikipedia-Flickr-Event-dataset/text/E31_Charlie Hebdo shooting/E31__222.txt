PESHAWAR, Pakistan — A hard-line cleric in northwest Pakistan has led a memorial service for the two brothers who attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, praising their assault.

Pir Mohammad Chishti, who runs a religious seminary in the city of Peshawar, led the prayers Tuesday. About 40 people attended, with some carrying banners condemning the magazine. They chanted praise for Said and Cherif Kouachi, who massacred 12 people in the newspaper attack last week and were later killed by police.

Charlie Hebdo often lampooned organized religions, including Islam by drawing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Such depictions are considered blasphemous by many Muslims.

Chishti told reporters at the prayer ceremony that anyone who commits blasphemy should be killed.
