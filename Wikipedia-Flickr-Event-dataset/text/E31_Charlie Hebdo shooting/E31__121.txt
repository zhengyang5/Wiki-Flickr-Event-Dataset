The BTP said the move was to reassure the public and to “maintain visibility”.

A spokesman said: “Since 2012, we have deployed armed officers within London.

“The safety of rail passengers and staff is of paramount importance to us, and we want to provide a reassuring, visible armed presence to deter terrorism on the rail network.

“In light of the events in Paris, we have increased patrols at St Pancras, in order to maintain and provide enhanced visibility and reassurance to the public. We keep our security arrangements under constant review.”

Today, police across Britain have paid tribute to the two officers murdered in the Paris terror attack.

At 10.30am, 24 hours after the shootings at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, officers and police staff paused “in solidarity and sympathy”.

The tribute came as it emerged that another French police officer had died in the south of Paris although it is unclear whether the shooting is linked to the attack on Charlie Hebdo.

The request for the show of respect came from the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) and the Police Federation.

British Transport Police chief constable Paul Crowther said his teams had spoken with their French counterparts at the St Pancras Eurostar terminal and offered their condolences.
