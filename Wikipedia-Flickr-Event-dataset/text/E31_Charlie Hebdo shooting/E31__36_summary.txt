French media reported that four high-profile cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo – including the publication’s editor-in-chief, Stéphane Charbonnier – were among the dead.
Another Charlie Hebdo staffer, Sigolène Vinson, told RFI that one of the shooters aimed his gun at her but spared her.
She said he left, shouting, “Allahu akbar, allahu akbar.”Sharing the same floor with Charlie Hebdo is a documentary production house, Premières Lignes.
