Famed anime director Hayao Miyazaki may have retired from making feature films, but it’s not because he’s run out of clearly defined ideas or things to say.
While discussing a host of other topics, the conversation turned to the tragic events of January 7, when two terrorists stormed the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris, killing 12 and injuring 11 during the assault.
The January 7 attack is being considered an act of retaliation for Charlie Hebdo’s depictions of Muhammad, a practice frowned upon by many of the Islamic faith, militant fundamentalists in particular.
So how does Miyazaki feel about the drawings in question?
Following his condemnation of Charlie Hebdo’s illustrations, he continued on to assert, “Instead of doing something like that, you should first make caricatures of your own country’s politicians.”Source: Yahoo!
