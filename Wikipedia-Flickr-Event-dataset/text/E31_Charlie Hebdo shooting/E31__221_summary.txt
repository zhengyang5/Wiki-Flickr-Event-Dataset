PESHAWAR, Pakistan — A Pakistani cleric has held funerals for Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, the Islamist terrorist brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre.
"Today we feel so proud to attend the funeral of our brothers,” said cleric Allama Pir Mohammad Chishti after leading the funeral in absentia in the city of Peshawar.
Flowers are placed in front of a banner bearing the names of the Charlie Hebdo attackers at their funeral in absentia in Peshawar, Pakistan, on Tuesday.
Chishti runs the Ghousia Madrassa, or Islamic religious school.
Pakistanis are often the victims of religious extremism, with more than 50,000 dying in bomb explosions and suicide attacks since 2002.
