In the wake of yesterday's tragic attack, the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo is planning its biggest print run ever.
Hebdo's usual circulation is around 30,000, but the surviving staff are planning to print 1 million copies of next week's run, in a gesture that's equal parts defiance and grief.
Eight members of the magazine's staff were killed in the attack, alongside four other victims.
To fund the unprecedented print run, Hebdo is getting help from some unexpected places.
