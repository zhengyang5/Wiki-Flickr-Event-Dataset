Egyptian cartoonists have marked their condemnation of Wednesday's deadly attack on the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo by inking more cartoons.
Together Makhlouf and Anwar also wrote short profiles in the privately-owned daily Al-Masry Al-Youm on the French cartoonists killed in the attack.
After you killed cartoonist Naji Al-Ali [influential Palestinian cartoonist killed in 1987], and your bullet settled in his head… his head that frustrated and threatened you… we knew that our weapon is stronger than yours," he wrote.
Makhlouf also pointed out that Charlie Hebdo has been critical of their French government and other religions, not just Islam.
At least 12 people, mostly journalists, were killed in Paris on Wednesday when gunmen opened fire on them inside the Charlie Hebdo office.
