Single digit temperatures didn’t stop several hundred people from gathering in Union Square last night for a vigil for the victims of Wednesday’s Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris.

New Yorkers and French expatriates lit candles and held signs reading “Je Suis Charlie” (“I am Charlie”), the viral rallying cry of Charlie Hebdo supporters.

Between 200 and 400 people attended the march, including Francois Delattre, the French ambassador to the United Nations.

At one point the group of supporters sang the French national anthem, “La Marseillaise.”

A dozen people died in the attack on Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical newspaper, including editor-in-chief Stephane Charbonnier, several political cartoonists and two police officers.
