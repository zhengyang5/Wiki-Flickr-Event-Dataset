Gunfire broke out Wednesday in an attack at the offices of French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, leaving 12 dead, including four prominent cartoonists.
Within its pages, the magazine published 12 cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, bringing unprecedented condemnation from the Muslim world.
The issue has since been considered the one which positioned Charlie Hebdo as a target for terrorist attacks.
Before a French court sided with Charlie Hebdo in the lawsuit, in 2007, another cartoon was published with the text "Charlie Hebdo must be veiled!"
The Charlie Hebdo offices were firebombed following its publication.
