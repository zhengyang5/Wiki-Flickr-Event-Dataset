Bill Donohue speaks to CNN (Screenshot)The head of the self-described largest Catholic civil rights organization in the United States said Wednesday that he did not condone the murder of journalists at the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, but sympathized with the perpetrators.
But neither should we tolerate the kind of intolerance that provoked this violent reaction,” Catholic League president Bill Donohue said in a statement.
Donohue said Charlie Hebdo had a “long and disgusting record ” of mocking religious figures, including unflattering depictions of the Prophet Mohammad and Catholic popes.
“While some Muslims today object to any depiction of the Prophet, others do not,” he continued.
What unites Muslims in their anger against Charlie Hebdo is the vulgar manner in which Muhammad has been portrayed.
