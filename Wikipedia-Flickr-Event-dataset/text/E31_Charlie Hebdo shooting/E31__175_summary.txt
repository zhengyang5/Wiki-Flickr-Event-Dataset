Russia's media watchdog on Friday warned that the publication of religious-themed religious cartoons, like those of Charlie Hebdo, could be considered a crime.
Russia's communications watchdog issued a formal warning to the country's media on Friday against publishing religious-themed cartoons, saying their publication could be classified as a crime.
The warning issued on Roskomnadzor's federal website followed an earlier statement on its Facebook page and previous warnings from regional branches of the watchdog.
The Kamchatka branch of Roskomnadzor wrote to local news outlets Tuesday to warn them that publishing cartoons of religious figures was "inadmissible."
The website obliged, covering up the picture of the magazine cover with a notice reading: "We can't show you this image at the request of Roskomnadzor."
