Charlie Hebdo: Afghan Taliban condemns cartoons depicting prophet, hails Paris gunmenUpdatedThe Afghan Taliban has lauded the deadly attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine office and condemned the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in France.
The Taliban, which ran a hardline Islamic government in Afghanistan from 1996-2001, said world leaders should prevent such cartoons from being released.
A few hundred people demonstrated last week in the central Afghan province of Uruzgan, praising the gunmen and criticising president Ashraf Ghani's condemnation of the attack in Paris.
Five million copies of the Charlie Hebdo issue will be printed, but the first print-run of 700,000 copies sold out quickly in Paris.
Demand for the latest Charlie Hebdo edition was high in partly French-speaking Belgium, with the 30,000 that were due to go on sale there expected to sell out quickly.
