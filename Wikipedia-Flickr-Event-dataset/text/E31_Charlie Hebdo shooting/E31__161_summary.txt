Europe’s Muslims are feeling the heat of a fierce backlash following last week’s terror attack against French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
French authorities are warning the nation against linking French Muslims with terrorists.
National Front leader Marine Le Pen seized upon the Charlie Hebdo attack just hours after it happened, suggesting it was a vindication of her party’s xenophobic stance.
Anti-Islam sentiment spread further after the killing of four people by a French Muslim at the Brussels Jewish Museum in May.
“If you can do that in Charlie Hebdo offices, you can do it in a mosque,” he said.
