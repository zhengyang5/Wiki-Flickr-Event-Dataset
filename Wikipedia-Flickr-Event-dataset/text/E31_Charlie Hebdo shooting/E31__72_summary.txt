In Paris itself, a gunman holding hostages in a Jewish supermarket has been killed, but a number of hostages also died.
Two men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had been barricaded in a printing factory in Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) from Paris.
In 2008, Cherif Kouachi was jailed for three years for his role in sending militants to Iraq, but 18 months of the sentence was suspended.
Coulibaly is believed to have had a long history of criminal activity - including drugs offences - and links to at least one of the Kouachi brothers.
Reports say Coulibaly - along with Cherif Kouachi - was a committed follower of Djamel Beghal.
