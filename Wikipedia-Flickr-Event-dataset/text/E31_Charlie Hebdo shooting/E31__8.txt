Google has paid tribute to the 12 victims of the massacre at the offices of Charlie Hebdo with a black ribbon placed on its homepage.

The black ribbon was first seen on Google Franceâ€™s page before being added to the search engine's UK homepage. It appears alone without any text or accompanying graphics.

Tributes have been paid across the world to the eight journalists, two policemen, a visitor and a maintenance worker killed in the brutal attack.

For the second night Parisians flocked to the Place de la Republique for a vigil to remember those who died, while the Eiffel Tower was plunged into darkness in tribute to those slaughtered.

The hashtag #JesuisCharlie continues to trend after hundreds of thousands used it in messages of solidarity with those affected by the attack. "Je Suis Charlie" translates as "I am Charlie".

A massive manhunt for two brothers wanted in connection with the massacre entered its third day on Friday.
