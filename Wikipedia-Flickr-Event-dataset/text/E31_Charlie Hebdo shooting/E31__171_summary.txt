BERLIN (AP) â€” Police in Germany have detained two men suspected of an arson attack early Sunday against a newspaper that republished the cartoons of French weekly Charlie Hebdo.
The newspaper Hamburger Morgenpost said on its website the overnight arson attack destroyed several files in its archive, but didn't injure anyone.
Hamburg police said it had detained the two young men near the newspaper building.
The Hamburg tabloid newspaper published the Charlie Hebdo cartoons the day after the attack against the newspaper in Paris to express its solidarity with the slain journalists.
Several other national and local German newspapers also published the cartoons.
