Thousands of people have taken to social media to express solidarity with the Parisian newspaper Charlie Hebdo that was attacked Wednesday by apparent Islamic extremists.
Ignoring the attack and the threat of further violence, Charlie Hebdo published more Muhammad pictures the following year.
The phrase "Charlie Hebdo" quickly became the top trending term on Twitter, and thousands took to using the hashtag "#jesuischarlie" or "I am Charlie" to show support.
Twitter France sent out a message saying that as of 1:30 p.m.
