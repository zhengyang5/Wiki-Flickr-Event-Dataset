When Fanny Ratisseau woke up on Wednesday morning in Calgary, she turned on the French news, as she does every day.
Soon, Ratisseau set to work helping to organize a Calgary vigil in honour of the victims of Wednesday’s brutal terror attack at a controversial French newspaper in Paris.
It’s horrible everything that happened, but they won’t win,” Ratisseau told a crowd gathered at Olympic Plaza on Wednesday evening.
Roy Klassen, Honorary Consul for France in Calgary, spoke briefly and told vigil attendees he was saddened by Wednesday’s events in France.
“It’s not only against the French journalists or the French people, it’s against freedom … Everyone, all over the world, is concerned at what’s happening.”AKlingbeil@calgaryherald.com
