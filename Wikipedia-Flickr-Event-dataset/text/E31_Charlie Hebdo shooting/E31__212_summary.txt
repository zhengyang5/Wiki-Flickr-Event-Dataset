Local politicians, teenaged students and women with veils covering their faces packed the main square in Marawi in the southern Philippines, some raising their fists in the air as a Charlie Hebdo poster was burnt.
Twelve people including eight Charlie Hebdo cartoonists and journalists and two police officers were killed last week after Islamist militants struck the magazine's Paris office, in an attack that has sparked outrage worldwide.
The protest in the Philippines was one of first reported worldwide since the violence to express outrage at Charlie Hebdo.
One of the streamers read: "France must apologise", while another read: "You mock our prophet, now you want an apology?"
Muslims are a minority in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, with most living in remote southern regions they regard as their ancestral homeland.
