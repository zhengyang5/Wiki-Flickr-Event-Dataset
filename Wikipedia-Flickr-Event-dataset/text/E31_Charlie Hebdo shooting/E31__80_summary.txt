SANAA (Reuters) - One of two brothers suspected of carrying out the deadly shooting at a French satirical weekly met leading al Qaeda preacher Anwar al Awlaki during a stay in Yemen in 2011, a senior Yemeni intelligence source told Reuters on Friday.
REUTERS/Paris Prefecture de Police/Handout via ReutersU.S. born and web-savvy, Awlaki was seen as an influential international recruiter to the al Qaeda movement and a prominent figure in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the groupâ€™s most active affiliate.
U.S. and European sources close to the investigation said on Thursday that one of the suspects in the French attack, Said Kouachi, was in Yemen for several months training with AQAP.
The southern province of Shabwa is a lawless area where al Qaeda militants and the security forces have clashed in recent years.
There was no immediate evidence that the graphic actually inspired the Paris attack.
