Two terrorists shouted that they were from al Qaeda in the Yemen before they launched the brutal attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.

Cédric Le Béchec, a 33-year-old estate agent who witnessed the attack on the satirical magazine, said the men told bystanders to inform the media that they were from the terror group.

He said that the men arrived in a black car, stopping in the middle of the street. One of them was carrying a rocket-propelled grenade. They were dressed in black military-style clothing.

Mr Le Béchec said that before launching the assault, the attackers approached another man in the street saying, “Tell the media that this is al-Qaeda in the Yemen.”

The police arrived five minutes later after they left, following the assault on the magazine's offices.

Mr Le Béchec said that the two attackers fled at the wheel of a grey Renault Clio. The stolen vehicle’s owner, who is believed to be in his sixties, was being questioned by the police.

According to Mr Le Béchec, the vehicle's owner asked for his dog to be let out of the car and was allowed to remove his dog.

The Yemeni offshoot of al-Qaeda has exploited recent instability to seize parts of the country's south and east.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is regarded by the United States as the deadliest branch of the global jihadist network, blamed for several attempted attacks on Western targets.
