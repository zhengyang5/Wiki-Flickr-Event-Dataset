The owner of a printing factory who was taken hostage by the Charlie Hebdo attack suspects in Dammartin-en-Goele described on Saturday how he helped a colleague hide from the Kouachi brothers .

Michel Catalano said he saw a man holding a Kalashnikov from his window and could see it was a dangerous situation.

He told his colleague, Lilian Lepere, to hide and then spoke to the men.

Mr Catalano said the brothers were not aggressive and that he had made them a coffee.

He then noticed one of them was injured and helped bandage his wound.

Michel Catalano said he saw a man holding a Kalashnikov from his window and could see it was a dangerous situation.

When asked if he was scared Catalano said he "stayed calm throughout" though was unsure how.

"I didn't get the impression they were going to harm me" he added.

Lilian, 26, was hidden in a box throughout.

Catalano said his colleague was secretly sending information to the police about what was going on at the printing house.

The brothers allowed Catalano to leave after about an hour.

They were later killed during a dramatic shoot-out with police.
