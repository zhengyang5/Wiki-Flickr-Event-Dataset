Hundreds gathered at the French Consulate in San Francisco Wednesday evening in honor of the 12 people murdered today in an apparent terrorist attack at the offices of French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo.
The crowd gathered in front of the consulate at 88 Kearny St. holding signs that read "Je Suis Charlie," or "I am Charlie," to show solidarity with those killed.

San Francisco Police closed off Kearny between Geary and Post to allow the overflowing crowd to spread into the street.
