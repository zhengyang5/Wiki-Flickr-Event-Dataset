At the time, Chérif Kouachi was a pot-smoking pizza delivery man, drifting through life with only the vaguest of attachments to religion.
“This was the realization of a long-term obsession,” said Myriam Benraad, a researcher at the Paris-based Sciences Po university who has closely studied the group of young men, Kouachi included, who were indoctrinated by the janitor and self-styled preacher at a northern Paris mosque.
Authorities are also looking into whether Chérif Kouachi made a more recent trip to Syria.
Like many of those seduced today, Kouachi was young and directionless when he fell under the spell of radical Islam.
But unlike Kouachi, Benyettou was able to mesmerize his peers with a seeming mastery of the Koran and intrigue them with his murky ties to North African militant groups.
