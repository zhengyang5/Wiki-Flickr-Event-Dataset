In response to Wednesday's attack, at least three Danish newspapers are planning to print copies of cartoons from Charlie Hebdo, according to the BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Copenhagen.
But none of the Copenhagen press are planning to reprint the 12 Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that ignited anger in some areas of the Muslim world seven years ago.
Yet security has been tightened at all of the country's media outlets as a result of the massacre.
The editor of the tabloid BT said he would be running with Charlie Hebdo's most controversial cover - one that showed a weeping Muhammad overwhelmed by fundamentalists, lamenting that it was hard being loved by idiots.
