Protests against Charlie Hebdo’s depiction of the Prophet Mohamed have continued to grow in strength in some parts of the predominantly Muslim world, as publishers confirmed that a new edition of the magazine won’t be released for a number of weeks.
In Chechnya, extraordinary images showed hundreds of thousands taking to the streets after the Kremlin-backed regional government declared a holiday for people to attend the demonstration.
Those present at the so-called “Love to Prophet Mohamed” protest combined pro-Islamic and anti-Western chants, and some carried signs in English in an overt appeal to international coverage.
There were suggestions that the protest, held in the Chechen capital of Grozny, was supported by Vladimir Putin as an outlet for the expression of outrage at Charlie Hebdo at a remove from the Kremlin itself.
Hundreds gathered outside the French embassy in Tehran, calling for the ambassador to be expelled, while conservative politician Ahmad Tavakoli said the Charlie Hebdo shootings were “the fruit of your own action”.
