France has Europe’s largest Muslim population and is in the throes of a virulent debate over national identity and the role of Islam.
A book by journalist Eric Zemmour entitled “Le suicide francais” (French suicide), arguing that mass Muslim immigration is among factors destroying French secular values, was the best-selling essay of 2014.
PEGIDA, whose rise mirrors electoral gains by the right-wing Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, was quick to claim the Paris attack vindicated its views.
“Does a tragedy like this first have to happen in Germany?”A poll taken in November, well before the Paris attack, found 57 percent of non-Muslim Germans feel threatened by Islam.
In Britain, the leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, said the Paris attack was the result of a “fifth column” living in European countries.
