AUSTRALIAN extremists have spread their vile hatred online justifying the horrific attack on a satirical magazine in Paris because they insulted the prophet.

Perth-based firebrand Junaid Thorne tweeted within hours of the attack that killed 12 at Charlie Hebdo’s office in Paris that insulting someone’s prophet would cause a “backlash.”

The self-styled Sheik, who has thousands of followers on Twitter and Facebook, chillingly said those that want freedom of speech could expect other to exercise ‘freedom of action.’

Insulting a religion is likely to cause a backlash, even if done under 'freedom of speech'. #CharlieHebdo #ParisShooting — Sh. Mohammed Junaid (@MJunaidThorne) January 7, 2015

Insulting someone's Prophet is very likely to stimulate some kind of response. It is not allowed under any context/religion. #CharlieHebdo — Sh. Mohammed Junaid (@MJunaidThorne) January 7, 2015

“Insulting a religion is likely to cause a backlash, even if done under ‘freedom of speech’.

#CharlieHebdo #ParisShooting,’’ Thorne tweeted.

“Insulting someone’s Prophet is very likely to stimulate some kind of response. It is not allowed under any context/religion.”

“If you want to enjoy ‘freedom of speech’ with no limits, expect others to exercise ‘freedom of action.”

Another Australian Islamic convert tweeted the magazine’s cartoonist got what they deserved because they drew a picture of Mohammed naked.

“This magazine #CharlieHebdo drew pictures of #Muhammed(saw) naked with his genitiles visable as such they got what they deserve, (SIC)” the man with more than 2000 followers said.

“Muslims should be proud of what the Mujahideen in France did a country which has done everything in it’s power to fight Islam”.

Notorious UK based hate-cleric Anjem Choudary said freedom of expression did not extend to insulting the prophet.

“May Allah allow all Muslims & non-Muslims live together under divine law where the honour of citizens & Prophets is protected #ParisShooting,’’ Choudary said.

The murdered Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier was on a ‘’dead or alive’’ list in al-Qaeda’s English magazine. The jihadist propaganda magazine’s March 2013 edition called its followers to “defend the prophet.”

The magazine also puts targets on academic Salman Rushdie and right-wing Dutch politician Geert Wilders who visited Australia in 2013.

Charbonnier was famously defiant to the threats once saying ‘I’d rather die standing than live kneeling.’
