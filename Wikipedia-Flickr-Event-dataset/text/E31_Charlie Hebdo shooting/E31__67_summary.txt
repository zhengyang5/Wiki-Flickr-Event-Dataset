The brothers who discovered the body of their mother were called Said and Cherif Kouachi.
Cherif Kouachi was buried in an unmarked grave in Genevilliers, west of Paris, late on Saturday night.
Many people met the Kouachi brothers during their short existence.
The younger, Cherif, was naughty and "turbulent".
The older, Said, was quieter, cried a lot and seemed to follow his younger brother, rather than the other way around.
