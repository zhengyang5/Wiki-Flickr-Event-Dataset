French authorities have told their U.S. counterparts that Said Kouachi, 34, made the trek to the terror hotbed in 2011, said the U.S. official, who is not authorized to comment on the case publicly.
He said the French authorities believed he traveled there before Sept. 30, 2011, when the senior al-Qaeda operative in Yemen, U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, was killed by a U.S. drone strike.
CLOSE Two masked attackers carrying machine guns and rocket launchers reportedly robbed a gas station 50 miles northeast of Paris on Thursday, prompting French authorities to investigate whether it was linked to the 'Charlie Hebdo' massacre.
Al Hakim had traveled to Iraq four times and is a co-founder of the al-Qaeda recruiting crew that Ch√©rif later joined.
