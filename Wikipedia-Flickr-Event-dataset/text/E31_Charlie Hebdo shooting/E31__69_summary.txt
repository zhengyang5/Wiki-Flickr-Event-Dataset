“Chérif Kouachi did not consider himself to be a good Muslim,” wrote Paris prosecutors in a final report after his 2005 arrest.
Saïd Kouachi, always quieter and seemingly less impulsive, had struggled to find work, sometimes picking up short-term jobs through government unemployment programs.
By the spring of 2010, the police began intercepting phone calls between Mr. Coulibaly, Mr. Kouachi and their jihadist mentor, speaking in what appeared to be code.
Surveillance pictures showed Mr. Kouachi leaving Paris on the A15 freeway for the more than 300-mile drive to Murat.
Mr. Beghal and Mr. Coulibaly were eventually convicted and returned to jail, with Mr. Coulibaly serving his sentence until last March.
