The youngest suspect in today's deadly attack at a satirical newspaper's office in Paris has turned himself in, French police said, while the other two are “on the loose, armed and dangerous."
Kouachi, along with six others, was sentenced in May 2008 to 3 years in prison for terrorism in Paris.
The French president called the attack a "terrorist operation."
The shooting at the office of Charlie Hebdo was a "cowardly attack," said President Francois Hollande when he was at the scene this morning.
