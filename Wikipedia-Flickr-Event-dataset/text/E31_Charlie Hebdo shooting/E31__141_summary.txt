Charlie Hebdo shooting: Crowds gather for vigils in Melbourne, Sydney, PerthUpdatedThousands of people have gathered in cities around Australia to remember the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris.
The men who carried out the shooting should not be linked to any community group, Ms Siena said.
Honorary consul for France in Western Australia, Patrick Kedemos, said the feeling in the Australian French community was one of shock, but also solidarity and resolve.
"We are far away but our hearts today [are] with our families and friends in France," he said.
She said she was surprised by the number of people who had gathered in Paris as part of the "Je suis Charlie" (I am Charlie) movement.
