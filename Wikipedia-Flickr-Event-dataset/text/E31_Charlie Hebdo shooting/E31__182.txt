Albert Uderzo, the 87-year-old creator of the well-loved French comic series Asterix, has come out of retirement to draw a new cartoon to show solidarity with the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack this week.

The two new cartoon have appeared, the most powerful of which shows Asterix punching an assailant high in to the air, while angrily exclaiming: “Moi aussi je suis un Charlie”, meaning: “I’m Charlie too”.

Another image appears to be a sketch showing the characters Asterix and Obelix stood next to each other, their head bowed and their hats in their hands. Asterix holds a single rose in one hand, and the small Dogmatix is seen looking sadly over his shoulder.

The images have been published in French newspaper Le Figaro, where Uderzo is quoted as saying: “I am not changing my work, I simply want to express my affection for the cartoonists that paid for their work with their lives.”

“How can anyone do something so appalling? How can people claiming to be human beings murder people they have never met but have said something wrong so from that moment, must be killed? This is insanity!”
