The search for the two other suspects — Said Kouachi, 34, and his brother, Cherif, 32, both of Paris — was continuing.
Police identified the suspects after one of them left his identity card in the car used to leave the scene of Wednesday's killings: the Paris headquarters of the satirical weekly paper "Charlie Hebdo."
French President Francois Hollande denounced the shootings as a terrorist attack and said France's best defense against such "barbarity" was unity.
Among the dead on the "Charlie Hebdo" staff were three cartoonists, including co-founder Jean “Cabu” Cabut and editor-in-chief Stephane “Charb” Charbonnier.
