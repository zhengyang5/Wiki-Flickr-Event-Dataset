The French magazine Charlie Hebdo was attacked this morning by gunmen, possibly al-Qaida members, who were apparently upset by its history of printing cartoons mocking radical Islam.
While much of the response to the attack has celebrated the notion of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, some news outlets have chosen to self-censor images of controversial Charlie Hebdo cartoons.
A just-broadcast segment about Charlie Hebdo's history of controversy on the network itself did not display any images of the cartoons.
The CNN International site's story on Charlie Hebdo likewise does not display the cartoons.
Outlets including Gawker, Vox, and the Free Beacon have reprinted a number of uncensored Charlie Hebdo covers.
