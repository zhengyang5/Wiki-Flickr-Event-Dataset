Riot police on Wednesday took up positions outside the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, whose former headquarters were firebombed last November after it published an issue called Sharia Hebdo featuring Mohammed as "guest editor".
Sunni Islam's highest authority, the Al-Azhar mosque, said the caricatures were "offensive to Islam and its Prophet, the prophet of humanity."
"It is with astonishment, sadness and concern that I have learned that this publication is risking increasing the current outrage across the Muslim world," he said.
The French Muslim Council, the main body representing Muslims, said it was "profoundly worried by this irresponsible act".
Right-wing former Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon said: "I defend Charlie Hebdo, I defend the freedom of expression and I think we mustn't give an inch of ground on this front".
