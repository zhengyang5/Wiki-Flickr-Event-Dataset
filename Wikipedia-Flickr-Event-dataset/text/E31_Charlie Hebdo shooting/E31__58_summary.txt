Philippe Lançon, a journalist specializing in Cuba and Latin America who is on staff at Libération, was gravely injured yesterday during the terrorist attack at Charlie Hebdo in Paris.
Philippe was attending an editorial team meeting when the two gunmen broke into the room and opened fire.
He is now in intensive care at a Paris hospital, where he is listed in critical but stable condition.
Philippe has been involved with PLAS since 2012.
I will post more news as soon as I can speak to Philippe, after he leaves the intensive care unit.
