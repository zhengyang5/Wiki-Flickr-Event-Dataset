There are three points in particular that stand out from early reports about the attack and the attackers.
First, there are indications that the attackers might have ties to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
In addition to official French mention of the group, one eyewitness watched as the attackers began their assault by calmly telling bystanders that they were from al-Qaeda in Yemen (in reference to AQAP).
Meanwhile AQ has made some military progress in Syria, but carried out no attacks in the U.S. or Europe.
The Paris attack, if it was indeed carried out by AQAP, might be AQâ€™s way of striking back at the IS as well as the West.
