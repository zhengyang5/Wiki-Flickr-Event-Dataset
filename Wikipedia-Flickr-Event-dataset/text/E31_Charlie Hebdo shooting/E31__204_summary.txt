Ahmed Merabet was the first police officer at the scene of the Charlie Hebdo attack.
“My brother was Muslim and he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims,” he said.
Malek berated media outlets and websites that showed the graphic content, which he said was extremely painful for the family.
The 42-year-old grew up in Livry-Gargan, in the north-eastern suburbs of Paris, and graduated from the local lycée in 1995.
As news spread that the gunned down policeman was a Muslim, the hashtag #JeSuisAhmed began spreading on Twitter in solidarity.
