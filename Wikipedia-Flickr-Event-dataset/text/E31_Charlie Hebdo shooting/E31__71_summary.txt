The two men were ripe pickings for Farid Benyettou, a known jihadi recruiter for Iraq, operating in the 19th arrondissement.
Chérif and Bouchnak were both arrested in January 2005 as they prepared to fly to Damascus, and on to fight in Iraq.

“The combat experience they acquired was useful in the cold-blooded assassinations they have carried out since.”Hakim’s 2008 arrest and imprisonment was thought to have broken up the Buttes-Chaumont network.
