The Afghan Taliban on Thursday condemned the Charlie Hebdo cartoons and lauded last week's deadly attack that resulted in the death of 12 people, hailing the shooters as "heroes."
In a statement released on Thursday, the extremist group lauded the deadly attacks that "punished" the "enemies of humanity," reported Asia One.
The statement went on to add that they "strongly condemn this repugnant and inhumane action and consider its perpetrators, those who allowed it and its supporters (to be) the enemies of humanity."
Hailing the two gunmen as "heroes" who meted out punishment for cartoons disrespect to Prophet Muhammad, the Afghan wing of Taliban appreciated them for "bringing the perpetrators of the obscene act to justice."
Although Afghanistan is a deeply conservative Muslim society, and vehement in protecting the religion, many Afghans reacted in horror and dismay after the Paris newspaper attack, saying the insult to Islam did not justify the bloodshed.
