Many memorialized their colleagues from Charlie Hebdo, a Paris-based satirical newspaper where attackers opened fire, killing 12 people this morning.

Here are some of the most moving tributes:

The cartoon posted (above) by Le Parisien, a local paper, asks the question that many are left with today: Why? They go on to compare a pump rifle to a pencil, a Kalashnikov rifle to a pen, and a grenade to an eraser.

Philippe Geluck is a Belgian comedian who shared the above post on Facebook. His message, translated into English, reads: "Dear all, Thank you for your affectionate reactions and messages. Like all of you, I am devastated by the attack against the comic Charlie Hebdo. I lost friends and teachers, and all of my thoughts go to those close to them. But beyond this tragedy, it is our society which is concerned; it's all of us, in its freedom of thought. January 7, 2014 is a black day for democracy. Shame on the religious fascism."

Chilean cartoonist Francisco J. Olea posted this message, along with cartoonists' tools arranged in the shape of a gun: Grab your weapons, mates!

Many highlight the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie, which translates to "I Am Charlie." The phrase has become a rallying cry for protesters.

Twitter reported through their French office that as of 7:15 p.m. local time, there had been more than 4,000 tweets mentioning the hashtag.
