While millions of people gathered in cities all over the world to show solidarity with the victims of the Paris terror attacks on Sunday, Luxembourg held its own tribute.

Hundreds of people, old and young, braved the cold to gather in Place de la Constitution in the capital, in what appeared to be a spontaneous rally.

Among those attending were Grand Duchess Maria Teresa as well as a number of politicians including Félix Braz, Carole Dieschbourg and EU Commissioner Viviane Reding..

Many carried banners reading the catchline “Je suis Charlie,” or “Ech sin Charlie” (I am Charlie), a statement which has become synonymous with support for freedom of speech and is a nod to Wednesday's terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo

One girl tied her hair up with pencils, the weapon of choice by the satirists who were targeted in the bombing, meanwhile the French Tricolore flag and Luxembourgish Roude Léiw flag were proudly waved by participants.

At around 3pm, those who gathered made a procession along Boulevard Roosevelt to the garden of the French embassy where French national anthem the "Marseillaise" was sung along with the Luxembourg hymn "Ons Hemeecht".

The crowds eventually broke up at around 3.30pm.

The demonstration was the third of its kind to be held in the capital following last week's terror attacks in Paris. On Thursday morning, around 500 people gave a silent vigil in Place Clairefontaine, which followed a smaller gathering on Wednesday evening.
