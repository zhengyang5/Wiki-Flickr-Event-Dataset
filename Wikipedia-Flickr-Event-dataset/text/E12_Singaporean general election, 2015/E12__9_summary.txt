LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY GENERAL ELECTION 1955 The first Legislative Assembly election was held under the new Rendel Constitution, the framework of a committee headed by Sir George Rendel that would grant local citizens more autonomy and share executive power with the British colonial authorities.
The electoral map was entirely revamped and the five names of Bukit Timah, Changi, Katong, Seletar and Tanglin was preserved but carved out from their old boundaries into new smaller wards.
The CS was also vested with the power to appoint four nominated Assembly Members.
The City Council President was excluded from the Assembly and the remaining five "Official" and three elected commerce chamber seats were scrapped.
As his Bukit Timah seat was not vacated, he served the most part of his term under detention.
