Since Singapore gained independence in 1965, only two candidates have secured less than 1 per cent of the vote.
Both candidates were involved in three-cornered fights in single member constituencies - Mr Samir in Bukit Batok SMC and Mr Cheo in MacPherson SMC.
Mr Samir, the managing director of software firm Anaplan Asia, secured just 150 of the vote in Bukit Batok SMC.
Mr Teo secured just 196 votes from 24,727 votes.
The seat was won by the Workers' Party's Lee Li Lian (54.5 per cent), defeating the People's Action Party's Koh Poh Koon (43.73 per cent).
