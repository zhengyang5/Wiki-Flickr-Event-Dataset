CITY COUNCIL ELECTION 1957

Following the adoption of the Rendel and McNeice Commission recommendations, Singapore was carved into 51 electoral constituencies with 32 in the urban areas that would make up the City Council, which were synonymous with the six wards comprising 18 elected seats under the previous Municipal Commission. The nine appointed seats in the Commission were scrapped. The approval for political parties to use a standard symbol in legislative elections were also extended to local elections. Among the incumbent Municipal Commissioners, now known as City Councillors, several had switched allegiance over the last four years. Three from LP and two independents joined LF, head of the ruling coalition in Singapore. Eight from PP were now part of the new LSP, formed by the merger of PP and DP. One each from LP and PP became independents, namely S. Jaganathan and Sim Beng Seng. Both were briefly with LF. Another two, independent P. R. Williams who was elected under LP and LF Minister J. M. Jumabhoy who was initially independent, had resigned from the Council. With the exception in one ward, LF, UMNO and the main opposition PAP worked together to avert multi-corner fights in the face of a fortifying LSP, which ran in all seats. Former Chief Minister David Marshall had quit LF and established WP, which fared well in its electoral debut and was to become a renowned opposition party in the decades to come. According to the official narrative, the pro-communists backed PAP and WP. As a result, both parties were close to winning all the seats they contested except one each. PAP came out on top in the race by securing the largest number of seats. When the Council was convened, PAP formed a coalition with UMNO while leaving out the trounced LF and one of its key leaders, Ong Eng Guan, was elected as the first Mayor in Singapore.
