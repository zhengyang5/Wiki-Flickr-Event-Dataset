Egyptian nationalism explodes onto international TV on 30th June 2013 and once again the world is running for their guns.
What is it about Egyptian nationalism that worries the US and it’s European counterparts?
Why is it standing by the Muslim Brotherhood, who are currently waging violence throughout Egypt?
Please don’t anyone speak about that all important aid that comes to the Egyptian military from the US because that is just a joke.
But it brings to mind for me a previous time when the Egyptians found their nationalism and pride.
