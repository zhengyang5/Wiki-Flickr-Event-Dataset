Artists from all fields and generations formed a large march that headed through Zamalek towards Tahrir Square.
"Leave, leave," protesters chanted.
"We will not leave; he has to leave," in reference to President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood.
The event was the largest march organised by artists since Egypt's January 2011 revolution.
Artists' and intellectuals' determination to remove President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood from power is supported by nationwide protests by Egyptians from all walks of life.
