Several protesters in Tahrir Square on Wednesday closed the gates of the iconic Mugamma building, amid escalating protests calling on President Mohamed Morsy to step down and hold early presidential elections.

The move marks the second day the Mugamma has been shut by anti-government protesters.

Protesters opened the Mugamma on Tuesday after closing it on Monday in a follow-up to landmark protests staged on 30 June.

The Mugamma is a key adminstrative building located on the southern side of Tahrir Square.
