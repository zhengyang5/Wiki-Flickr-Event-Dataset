Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya's Building and Development Party released a statement late Sunday asserting that a protester killed in Upper Egypt's Beni Suef governorate earlier in the day was a member of the Islamist group.
One man was declared dead following clashes between supporters and opponents of President Mohamed Morsi near the Freedom and Justice Party's offices in Beni Suef.
Atef Marzouk, a leading member of the group in Beni Suef, accused opponents of President Morsi of initiating the attack by firing birdshot at a pro-Morsi march.
Hours earlier, Ibrahim Hodeib, chief of security in Beni Suef, stated that the slain man had been an anti-Morsi protester.
Sunday, which remained peaceful for most of the day, witnessed clashes at night in the Upper Egyptian governorates of Beni Suef, Assiut and Fayoum.
