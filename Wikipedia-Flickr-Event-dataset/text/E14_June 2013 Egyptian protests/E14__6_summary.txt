Egyptian Copts are free to decide for themselves whether or not to take part in planned 30 June anti-government rallies, the Holy Synod of Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church has stated.
Synod members issued the statement at a Thursday meeting, where they also announced that a new church spokesman would soon be appointed by Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II.
The Holy Synod, which is comprised of 120 archbishops, represents the church's most authoritative decision-making body.
In April, Pope Tawdros criticised President Morsi for failing to protect Cairo's main Coptic Orthodox cathedral during sectarian clashes that left two dead and dozens injured.
Later the same month, the pope told Reuters that Egypt's Coptic Christians were facing increased marginalisation.
