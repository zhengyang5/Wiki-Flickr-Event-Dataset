The Paris demonstrations will be divided between those against President Mohamed Morsi and calling for early presidential elections, and others supporting the Islamist president.

Ahmed Lotfy, a Tamarod campaign official in France, told state-run news agency MENA that the local campaign has collected 1,800 signatures. The Tamarod petition was sent to Egypt a few days ago.

Lotfy said the group is organizing demonstrations on Sunday in Saint-Michel Square in the heart of Paris. The demonstrations have been organized in coordination with all the revolutionary and secular forces in Paris.

Revolutionary forces and movements, including the “April 6 Youth Department” are organizing other demonstrations in Opera Square in Paris to demand early presidential elections and to continue the 25 January revolution.

Others are demonstrating in front of the Egyptian Embassy in Paris on both Saturday and Sunday.

Khouly said that the Egyptian people have chosen democracy and that this must be respected.
