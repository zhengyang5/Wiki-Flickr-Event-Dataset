Moreover, the US Defence Department said it was still reviewing the Monday statement by Egypt's military.
"But I would say that we are supportive - as the (US) president has said - of the democratic transition in Egypt and this process requires compromise on everyone's part.
"A stable and secure Egypt is crucial for regional stability and security," said the spokesman for UN leader Ban Ki-moon.
Ashton's Wednesday meeting with Abdel-Nour, which also included the head of Egypt's liberal Free Egyptians Party Ahmed Said, tackled developments in the internal domestic situation and Egypt's democratic transition, reported MENA.
The statement urged Russian nationals currently in Egypt to avoid visiting places witnessing protests.
