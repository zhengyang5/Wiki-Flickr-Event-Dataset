An American student has been stabbed to death during anti-government protests in Egypt, the US State Department has confirmed.
Andrew Pochter, from Chevy Chase, Maryland, was killed after being stabbed in the chest in the coastal city of Alexandria, where anti-government protesters stormed an office of the ruling Muslim Brotherhood.
A Facebook post on Saturday that appeared to be from Pochter’s family suggested he was in the country teaching English to children and improving his Arabic.
The “R.I.P Andrew Driscoll Pochter” page had also been posted on by colleagues of Pochter at the US educational non-profit organisation where he was working.
A statement from Kenyon College said Pochter was interning in Alexandria with AMIDEAST, an American non-profit organisation that runs education and development programs in the Middle East and North America.
