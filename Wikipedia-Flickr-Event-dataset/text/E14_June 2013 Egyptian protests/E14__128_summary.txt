Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi was defiant Tuesday amid growing pressure to back down as the deadline for amilitary-imposed ultimatum approached and Morsi’s support — even within his own government — appeared to be slipping.
Morsi’s backers in the Muslim Brotherhood have vowed that they will not go quietly if their president is forced out.
Earlier on Tuesday, Morsi met with his defense minister, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, in an apparent bid to reach an accord.
Gun battles, rock-throwing and fistfights broke out across the country Tuesday between opposition protesters and Morsi supporters.
Fighting raged sporadically overnight near a pro-Morsi rally outside Cairo University.
