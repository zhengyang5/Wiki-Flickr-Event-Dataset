As Egypt's top leadership bickers about who will head the country's interim government, thousands have gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to celebrate what they are calling the "Second Revolution" - the military's ouster of President Mohamed Morsi last Wednesday.
This time, says dentist Dalia Ezzeldin, the crowds are celebrating the country's second revolution - the military's ouster of President Mohamed Morsi.
â€œI am here to encourage our army and our Egyptians and to support our revolution - it is not a coup.
Earlier in the day, Muslim Brotherhood supporters also took to the streets, demanding that Morsi be returned to the presidency.
It's not a military coup.
