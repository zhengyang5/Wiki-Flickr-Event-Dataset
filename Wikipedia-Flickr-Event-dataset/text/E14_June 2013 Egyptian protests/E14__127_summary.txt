CAIRO - In a passionate address to the nation Tuesday, Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi said he would not step down and vowed to protect his democratic constitutional legitimacy with his life.
“I am prepared to sacrifice my blood for the sake of the security and stability of this homeland,” Morsi said in his speech.
His democratic election and the legitimacy it enshrined were the main themes of a speech, during which Morsi’s tone often grew loud and passionate.
Earlier in the day, Morsi demanded that the armed forces withdraw their ultimatum, saying he would not be dictated to.
Meanwhile, in the ongoing chaos, Egyptian security and health officials said 16 people were killed on Wednesday and 200 people were wounded in clashes between Morsi opponents and supporters, Reuters reported.
