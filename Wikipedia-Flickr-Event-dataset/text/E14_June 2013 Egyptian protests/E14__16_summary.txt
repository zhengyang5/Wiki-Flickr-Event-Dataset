The "parliament" of Egyptian intellectuals stated they do not recognise Alaa Abdel-Aziz as culture minister, deeming all of his decision "invalid."
By law, the culture minister is also the president of the SCC, which ties the SCC to Egypt's presidential office.
Abdel-Aziz was appointed culture minister a month ago by Brotherhood-fielded President Mohamed Morsi.
As one of the most important parts of Egypt's culture ministry, the SCC is responsible for setting ministerial policies and organising ministry activities.
Said Tawfik resigned on Wednesday, 29 May in protest over the new minister's policies, which he described as "destructive to Egyptian culture."
