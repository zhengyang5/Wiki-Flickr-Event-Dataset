Morsi faces judicial revolt over decree Updated: 2012-11-26 08:52 (Agencies/China Daily)Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi faced a rebellion from judges who accused him on Saturday of expanding his powers at their expense, deepening a crisis that has triggered violence in the street and exposed the country's deep divisions.
Anti-Morsi protesters chant slogans in front of the Supreme Judicial Council building in Cairo on Saturday.
The decree defends from judicial review decisions taken by Morsi until a new parliament is elected in a vote expected early next year.
Egypt's highest judicial authority, the Supreme Judicial Council, said the decree was an "unprecedented attack" on the independence of the judiciary.
The Judges' Club, meeting in Cairo, called on Morsi to rescind it.
