Anti-governoment protesters forced the closure of several governors' offices across Egypt on Monday as protests demanding early presidential elections and the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy spread.
In Sohag, Upper Egypt, dozens closed the governorate office with chains, setting up protest tents and blocking state employees from entering the building.
Some workers claimed governor Yahia Abdel Azim did not come to work on either Sunday or Monday.
Demonstrators in Assiut also prevented the governor, Yahia Keshk, and staffers from entering the governorate building.
In Monufiya in the Nile Delta, the governorate building remained closed for the 15th day running.
