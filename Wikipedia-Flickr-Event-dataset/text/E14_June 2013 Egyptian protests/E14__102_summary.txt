The Delta governorate of Menufiya is meanwhile witnessing widespread civil disobedience, said Al-Dostour Party member Yosri Ramzy.
“The majority of Port Said is protesting, yet civil disobedience will widely start on Tuesday if Mohamed Morsi does not step down,” Saeed stated.
The Tamarod (Rebellion) campaign issued its first statement of “the revolution” early Monday morning, demanding Morsi step down by Tuesday 5pm.
The campaign threatened that if demands are not met by Tuesday afternoon, calls for civil disobedience will begin throughout the country, together with an invitation to the people to besiege the presidential palace.
