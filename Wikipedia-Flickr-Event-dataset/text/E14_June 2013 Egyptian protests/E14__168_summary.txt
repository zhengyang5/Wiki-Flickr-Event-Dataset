Egypt's Tahrir Square has seen nearly hundred women falling victim to "rampant" sexual attacks during the past four days of protests against President Mohamed Morsi, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.
The global rights watchdog said on Wednesday that the mobs sexually assaulted "and in some cases raped at least 91 women" in Tahrir Square amid a climate of impunity.
Sexual harassment has long been common in Egypt, but its increasing occurrence and ferocity has shaken the protest movement.
A large number of women had fallen victim to gang assaults too in the square - the epicenter of 2011 revolution.
Others say the assaults are organised to scare women off from joining protests and to stain the image of the anti-government demonstrations.
