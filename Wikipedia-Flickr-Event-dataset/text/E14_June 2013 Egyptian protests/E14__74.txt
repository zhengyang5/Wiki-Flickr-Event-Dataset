At the pro-Morsi protests in Al Raba’a al Adawiya Square in the Cairo suburb of Nasser City, Islamists carried batons and wore construction helmets to protect them from attacks by Islamists. Many Islamist protesters made a point of asking foreign journalists if they felt safer there than in Tahrir Square, where xenophobia has reached dangerous levels. “I think that in Tahrir they’re all remnants of the former regime and the opposition. If they want change they should do it through the ballot box,” said Mohammed Sobhy, a 34 year old clothing merchant from Cairo. “The president came to power through elections so he should go through elections.”

Though Mr. Sobhy was convinced that the anti-Morsi protesters represented a counter-revolution, he said he accepted their right to express dissent.

“I believe after the revolution we have freedom of speech,” he said. But he cautioned against the precedent that would be set if Mr. Morsi left power due to demonstrations: the Islamists would continue their own protests. “Egypt won’t see another president ever.”
