The media isn't eager to report it, but Obama isn't exactly popular these days. The latest wave of signs show Egyptian protesters are taking up conservative photoshops of Obama in Muslim garb and fashion to denounce his support for the Muslim Brotherhood.

Liberals in a Muslim country protesting by depicting Obama as a Muslim has to be a paradox to blow the minds of American liberals.

There are a number of signs reading, "Morsi and Egypt Don't Mix". The slogan, presumably translated from Egypt, becomes a bit confusing here with "American government and people don't mix... Love USA People". But the overall message is clear and clarified even further by Obama photoshopped as Osama bin Laden.

Here Obama has a more traditional Islamist beard. This may be a photoshop of him with Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie.

The message here would seem to reference the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt. And it's back to Obama as Osama.

Obama finances Terror Using $13 Billion in Stolen USA People's Money is another conservative type message.

We don't negotiate with terrorist, we finance them is a message that could show up at any Tea Party rally.

Pretty straightforward aside from the kerning.

A reference to Obama's F-16 refusal

You might think that Obama would be popular with Morsi supporters. But no he isn't. Being depicted surrounded by shoes is not a compliment in the Muslim world. Photoshops of Obama as Mussolini are likely taken from conservative sources.

That Cairo speech sure made us popular in the Muslim World... didn't it.
