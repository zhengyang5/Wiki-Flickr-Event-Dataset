Eight independent non-Islamist parliamentarians officially resigned from Egypt's upper house of parliament, the Shura Council, on Monday in protest at the simmering political stand-off in the country.
Speaker of the Islamist-dominated Shura Council, Ahmed Fahmy, is to look at the resignations in a board meeting on Tuesday.
Among the reasons cited by the resigned members are mounting political polarization, continuing deadlock and solidarity with the opposition’s demands.
On Saturday, Shura Council member Nadia Henry announced during a conference convened by the anti-President Morsi ‘Rebel’ campaign the resignations of independent parliamentarians in solidarity with the signature drive.
In their Monday meeting with Fahmy, resigned members reiterated calls for snap elections to end the current political standoff.
