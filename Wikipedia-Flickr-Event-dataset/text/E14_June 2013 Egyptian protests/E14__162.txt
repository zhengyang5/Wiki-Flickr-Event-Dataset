Abuja – Foreign Affairs Minister Olugbenga Ashiru has urged the Nigerian community in Egypt to remain calm following the latest violence in that country.

A young American was killed on Friday in Alexandria while photographing clashes between opponents and supporters

of President Mohammed Morsi.

Reports said the protests continued in different Egyptian cities on Sunday with anti government protesters calling

on Morsi to resign.

In an e-mailed response to questions by newsmen in Abuja, on the welfare of Nigerians in the

country, Ashiru said he had been following carefully the situation in Egypt.

“I am in touch with our ambassador in Cairo. We are watching developments carefully but there is no cause for alarm.

“I do believe that the authorities in Egypt will contain the situation.

“Also the ambassador is in contact with the leadership of the Nigerian community in Egypt on the need to remain calm,” he said.

Already, the U.S. has authorised the departure of it’s non emergency diplomatic staff and their families, after an American citizen was killed in clashes in the city of Alexandria on Friday.

Also the U.S. and the UK have updated their travel alert on the country, warning their nationals against any visit to Egypt.

The Federal Government evacuated more than 1,000 nationals in Egypt, in the wake of the violent anti-government protests that ousted former President Hosni Mubarak.

Many of the returnees from Egypt were students, medical patients and visitors, who were stranded in some parts of

the country during the revolution that sacked Mubarak. (NAN)
