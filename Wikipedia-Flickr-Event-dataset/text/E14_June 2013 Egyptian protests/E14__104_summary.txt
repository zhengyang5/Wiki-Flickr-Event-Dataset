Cairokee, an Egyptian rock band formed in 2003, performed live in front of the Ittihidaya Presidential Palace on Monday night, where thousands of anti-Mursi protesters gathered.
According to Ahram Online, the band tweeted “we will join the Egyptian people at Ittihadiya” before the performance.
The band is famous for their songs mainly related to politics since the January 25 revolution which ousted former leader Hosni Mubarak.
Some of their famous hits include Ya, el Midan (Oh You, the Square) in reference to Cairo’s iconic Tahrir Square.
UAE-based The National newspaper described this song as “a touching duet about Egypt's awakening political consciousness” in a review of the band.
