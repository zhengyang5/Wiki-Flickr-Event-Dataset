Yesterday’s events have caused me to reflect on the Egyptian opposition and on the road they’ve taken since the overthrow of Mubarak in early 2011.
Or at least since the South Korean democratic opposition failed to unite around a single candidate in 1987.
As I see it, the biggest failing of Egypt’s liberal democratic leaders has been precisely this failure to foster liberal and democratic values amongst Egyptian activists and ordinary citizens.
For a democratic transition to succeed, however, a leadership committed to fostering liberal, democratic values (among other things) has to exist.
Egyptians don’t have that in the MB, and sadly, they don’t have it in the leadership of the democratic opposition either, at least so far.
