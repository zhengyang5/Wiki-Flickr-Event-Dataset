For the Rab’a dispersal, Human Rights Watch arrived at its own casualty figure, which exceeds the FMA tally, by cross-checking the official register with figures compiled by the quasi-official National Council for Human Rights (NCHR) and documentation conducted by Human Rights Watch researchers and Egyptian human rights lawyers.
Using aerial photos, Human Rights Watch calculated that there were approximately 85,000 protesters at the Rab’a sit-in alone on August 2.
Instead, snipers on top of buildings repeatedly opened fire into crowds of demonstrators, local residents and protesters told Human Rights Watch.
Central Rab’a Square (Rab’a Hospital, Mosque, & Surrounding Structures)The Rab’a sit-in centered around the square at the intersection of Nasr and Tayaran Streets in front of the Rab’a al-Adawiya Mosque.
There was shooting between the field hospital and Rab’a hospital, and it was too difficult to carry the injured.
