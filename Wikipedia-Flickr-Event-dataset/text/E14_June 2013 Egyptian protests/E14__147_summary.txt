Egyptians in Australia Rise Up Against MorsiHundreds of Australians spilled onto Melbourneâ€™s streets in support of anti-Morsi protesters in Egypt.
Egyptians, young and old, Muslims and Christians, chanted in unison for a better future amid light security presence.
Yet June 30, 2013 does not mark the first time Egyptians have stood up against their government.
Just two years ago, Egyptians revolted against Hosni Mubarak in what became known as the January 25 revolution.
Despite being thousands of kilometers from Cairo, Egyptians in Melbourne felt that they would be betraying Egyptians in Cairo had they not demonstrated today.
