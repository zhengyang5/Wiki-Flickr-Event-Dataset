Cairo: A group calling themselves the Black Bloc movement has vowed to abandon violence during demonstrations planned to be staged on June 30 to withdraw confidence from President Mohammad Mursi and hold early presidential elections.
The Black Bloc demonstrators, hooded and masked and dressed in black from head to toe, appeared last January in Cairo and other provinces.
The statement added that Black Bloc youth will participate in the Tamarod “Rebellion” campaign.
Black bloc members said they will join all the revolutionary powers to save Egypt, topple Brotherhood Regime and regain Egypt’s people revolution.
Clashes broke out on Friday evening between members of the Black Bloc movement and central security forces at Shepheard Hotel near the US embassy.
