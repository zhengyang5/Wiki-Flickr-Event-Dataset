The Egyptian Armed Forces issued a televised statement on Monday afternoon giving Egyptian political forces 48 hours to "fulfil the people's demands," otherwise the armed forces would present a political "roadmap" for the country that would include all political currents.

"The Egyptian Armed Forces will not become involved in politics or administration; it is satisfied with its role as is spelt out in line with democratic norms," read the statement, stressing that Egyptian national security was in "great danger" and referring to the armed forces' "responsibility" to step in if national security was threatened.

"The Egyptian Armed Forces have set a deadline, which ended yesterday [Sunday], for all political powers to reconcile and end the current crisis, but no progress has been made. Consequently, the Egyptian people have taken to the streets," the statement read.

"Wasting more time will mean more division and conflict, which is what the armed forces warned of and of which it continues to warn," the statement added.

According to the statement, the absence of national consensus is what led the people to take to the streets in full determination, "which has been praised on the internal, regional and global level."

The statement went on to warn that more time would only lead to greater polarisation, urging all parties to put the public interest first.

"The armed forces reiterates its call that the demands of the people be met," the statement read, giving political factions a 48-hour period "as a last chance to bear the historical burden that the nation is currently facing."
