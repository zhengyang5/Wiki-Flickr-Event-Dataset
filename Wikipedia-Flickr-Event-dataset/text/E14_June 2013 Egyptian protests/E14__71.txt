Police inspector Brigadier General Mohamed Hani has reportedly been killed in Sinai as he was leaving his home in his car.

Militants attacked Hani and shot him dead before escaping, a security source told Ahram Online.

The killing comes as one in a series of attacks by militants targeting the police and military.

On 23 June, two police officers were kidnapped by gunmen in South Sinai. Also earlier in June, Major General Mohammed Abdelaziz, 30, was killed in the town of El-Arish on the Mediterranean.

Militants have exploited mounting lawlessness in the Sinai Peninsula since the 2011 uprising that swept autocrat Hosni Mubarak from power.

In August 2012, 16 Egyptian border guards were killed by militants near Egypt's border with Israel and Gaza. Attackers hijacked two Egyptian army vehicles and crossed the border into Israel, where they were killed by Israeli security forces.
