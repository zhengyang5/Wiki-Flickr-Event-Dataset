These are serious words,” said Morsi, whose country hosted a conference this week of Sunni clerics who issued a call for holy war against Damascus.
CAIRO—Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi said Saturday that he has cut all diplomatic ties with Damascus and is backing a no-fly zone over war-torn Syria , pitching the most populous Arab state more firmly against President Bashar Assad.
Morsi waved Syrian and Egyptian flags as he entered the auditorium packed with 20,000 supporters.
He also urged world powers not to hesitate to enforce a no-fly zone over Syria.
The Brotherhood joined calls this week from Sunni religious organizations for jihad against Assad and his Shiite allies.
