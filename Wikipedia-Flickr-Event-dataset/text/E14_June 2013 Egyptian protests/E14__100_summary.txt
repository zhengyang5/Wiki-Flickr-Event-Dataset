A group of protesters stormed the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) in Shebin al-Qanater, Qalyubiya, on Monday.
Following a brief siege, demonstrators vandalized the FJP building and removed the official sign outside before storming the compound.
Shebin al-Qanater has witnessed massive demonstrations and rallies, with marchers chanting slogans condemning President Mohamed Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood.
Also on Sunday, anti-Morsy protesters stormed Muslim Brotherhood and FJP headquarters in Sharqiya and Gharbiya in the Nile Delta, and Assiut in Upper Egypt.
An all-night siege of the Brotherhood's Guidance Bureau building in Moqattam in Cairo saw protesters set fire to and storm the building before ransacking it.
