Massive protests have swept across Egypt once more, and this time they are even larger than the Arab Spring protests that ousted Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

A military source told AFP that "millions" of protesters took to the streets. "It is the biggest protest in Egypt's history."

Their anger is now directed at President Mohamed Morsi, whom many believe has lost his legitimacy after becoming the country's first democratically elected president. There are also plenty of counter-protestors showing their support.

From the BBC:

The protesters accuse the country's first Islamist president of failing to tackle economic and security problems since taking power a year ago.

A presidential spokesman urged the demonstrators to respect the democratic process, referring to Mr Morsi's victory in last year's elections which were widely seen as free and fair.

One protestor speaking with BBC News rejected the notion of allowing Morsi to stay in power, despite being the first freely-elected leader in Egypt in 60 years.

"So what. He didn't fulfill the contract," the man said.

Photos taken by both journalists and citizens on Twitter show an incredible sea of bodies formed from Tahrir square to the front of the presidential palace.

Here's what we're seeing:
