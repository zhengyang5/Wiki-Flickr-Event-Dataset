Australians warned on Egypt travel Media release

Australians thinking of travelling to Egypt have been warned to exercise a high degree of caution in the face of ongoing unrest and anti-government rallies in Cairo and regional centres.

Speaking from Brunei, Foreign Minister Bob Carr said the US had increased its consular warning. But there was no evidence that Australians were specifically targeted.

"Australia urges its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution in Egypt due to the risk of civil unrest. Canada, UK, and NZ have issued similar warnings," Senator Carr said.

"Large protests are reportedly planned or are under way in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.

"Australians planning to travel to Egypt should remain alert, register their travel with our Embassy in Cairo and monitor any travel advice issued by authorities or consular staff.

"Regrettably, there are also reports that Islamic extremists have threatened violence against Coptic churches and communities.

"We urge all parties to renounce violence in holding street rallies, and for the Egyptian police and military to exercise appropriate restraint in keeping public order."

At least three people have died in recent unrest, including a US citizen who was stabbed while observing a street demonstration in Alexandria.

Australians have also been urged to avoid Egypt's North Sinai region due to an increased risk of terrorism. Australian travel advice and registration processes are available at www.smartraveller.gov.au
