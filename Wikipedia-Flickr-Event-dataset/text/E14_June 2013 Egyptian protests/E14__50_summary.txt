The Scaf will also play a significant role in the constituent assembly that will draft the country's new constitution.
Why did the Scaf issue this latest constitutional declaration?
Under the constitutional declaration of March 2011, parliament was supposed to form a 100-member committee to draft a new constitution.
Also, on 14 June the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled as unconstitutional the law on parliamentary elections, which resulted in the dissolution of parliament.
According to the new provisions, the next president will be sworn in before the General Assembly of the Supreme Constitutional Court.
