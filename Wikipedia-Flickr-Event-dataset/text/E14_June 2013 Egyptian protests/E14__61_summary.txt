Army concern about the way President Mohamed Morsi was governing Egypt reached tipping point when the head of state attended a rally packed with hardline fellow Islamists calling for holy war in Syria, military sources said.
The army's dramatic ultimatum demanding Morsi and other politicians settle their differences by Wednesday afternoon caught the presidency completely off guard.
Speaking on the eve of the protests, the president had dismissed the idea that the army would take control again.
Analysts have described it as an arrangement that suited both Morsi and a younger generation of army commanders seeking promotion.
He also responded to calls for the army to unseat Morsi, saying: "No one is going to remove anybody".
