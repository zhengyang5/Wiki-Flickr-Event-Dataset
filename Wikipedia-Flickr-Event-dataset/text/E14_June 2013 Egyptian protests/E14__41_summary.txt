After 18 days of mass protest, it took just over 30 seconds for Egypt's vice-president, Omar Suleiman, to announce that President Hosni Mubarak was standing down and handing power to the military.
There were similar celebrations from Alexandria to Suez, among protesters who were often too young to have known any other leader than Mubarak.
The protesters fanned out to other parts of the city and began a march on Mubarak's presidential palace.
By lunchtime he was on a plane with his family to Sharm el-Sheikh, where Tony Blair spent a family holiday as the guest of President Mubarak's government in two government villas.
A few hours later came the announcement that had Egypt celebrating in to the night.
