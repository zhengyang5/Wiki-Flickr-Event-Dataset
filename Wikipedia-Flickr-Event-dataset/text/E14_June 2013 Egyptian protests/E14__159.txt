OTTAWA — Canada has closed its embassy in Egypt amid anti-government protests in Cairo.

"We’re very concerned with the uncertainty that exists and that’s why we closed the Canadian embassy for security reasons," Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said Tuesday in Calgary.

Officials have confirmed that all Canadian diplomatic staff members in Egypt are safe and that around 1,800 Canadian citizens there have registered with consular officials.

Those who haven’t yet registered can do so online.

Alternately, Kenney says Canadians may want to begin their Egyptian exodus.

"If they are already in Egypt and feel unsafe, we encourage them to come back to Canada," he said.

On Sunday, protesters took to the streets in Cairo to demand an end to the regime of President Mohamed Mursi.

The armed forces chief of staff set a 48-hour ultimatum for a power-sharing deal but Mursi announced early Tuesday morning that he would pursue his own plan for national reconciliation.
