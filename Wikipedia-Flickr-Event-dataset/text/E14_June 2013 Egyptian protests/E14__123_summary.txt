In the clash near Cairo University, the dead included both local residents and Morsy supporters.
Witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch agreed that police were at the scene briefly but did not intervene to stop the bloodshed.
Several Morsy supporters told Human Rights Watch they had come under attack by unidentified “thugs” while walking toward the university from the northeast to attend the rally.
The Morsy supporters began marching with others on Ahmed Zewail Street, along the university’s northern edge, toward Tharwat Bridge.
Several local residents told Human Rights Watch that scuffles began when marchers attacked university students holding up anti-Morsy posters.
