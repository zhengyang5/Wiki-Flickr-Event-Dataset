Egypt continues on Tuesday to witness rival protests by both supporters and opponents of Brotherhood-fielded President Mohamed Morsi.
According to the statement, marches to Al-Qobba Palace are expected to start on Tuesday afternoon from Shubra, Matariya and Masr Sudan Road.
After the Egyptian Armed Forces issued their 48-hour ultimatum on Monday, some tentatively welcomed the move, while others interpreted it as setting the groundwork for a coup.
In response, the Armed Forces declared that coups are not permitted by their military doctrine.
Egypt's presidency revealed late Monday that Morsi had not been briefed on the Armed Forces' statement before it was released.
