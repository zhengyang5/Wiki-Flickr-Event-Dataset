By Ola NoureldinMinister of Tourism Hisham Zaazou returned to his office on Monday morning after withdrawing his resignation, which had come amid controversy over the former Luxor governor’s affiliation with an ex-militant group.
Zaazou will participate in an Arab tourism experts’ conference on Monday and a public relations conference in Sharm El Sheikh on Tuesday, state-run news agency MENA reported.
The Minister of Tourism showed his appreciation and gratitude for the decision made by former Luxor Governor Adel Al-Khayat to “take into account the interests of the country,” by resigning from his post, state run Al-Ahram reported.
Tourism workers and bazaar owners in Luxor meanwhile continued their sit-in in front of the Luxor governorate building despite the announcement of the governor’s resignation.
The protest will continue until a new governor is assigned, said Medhat Ramadan, a member of the Al-Dostour Party who is participating in the sit-in.
