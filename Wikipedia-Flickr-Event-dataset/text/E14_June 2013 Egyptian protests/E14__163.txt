BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) -- Palestinian Authority Religious Affairs Minister Mahmoud al-Habbash on Tuesday urged Arab Idol star Muhammad Assaf to cancel concerts planned for the West Bank to show solidarity with unrest in Egypt.

The PA minister also urged Palestine TV not to broadcast any celebratory events to reflect sympathy and solidarity with Egypt.

"This is a personal stance," he told Ma'an, and does not necessarily reflect any official position.

Al-Habbash said that while he appreciates the unique talent of Assaf, "certain conditions and developments necessitate that we delay festivities for two or more days."

"We are with what the Egyptian people want and what serves Egypt's interests," the religious affairs minister said.

"I am worried about Egypt, and this worry is justified both politically and in the field. I am worried because Egypt is the heart of the Arab nation, and the army of the nation."

Assaf arrived in the West Bank, which is governed by president Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian authority, on Monday afternoon, entering from Jordan over the Allenby Bridge. In Ramallah, Assaf laid a wreath on Arafat's tomb before meeting Abbas.

The singer is due to visit other West Bank towns Bethlehem, Hebron and Nablus.
