Protesters have put up 18 tents so far at the Ittihadeya presidential palace in Cairo's Heliopolis district, in preparation for mass demonstrations planned for Sunday aimed at forcing President Mohamed Morsi to step down.

They also set up a stage near the main entrance to Heliopolis Sporting Club, opposite Gate 4 of the palace.

Meanwhile, the security presence in the area is increasing as five Central Security Forces (CSF) trucks and a fire-extinguishing vehicle stand at Ittihadeya.

Similarly, the number of tents in Cairo's central Tahrir Square has increased to 150 after thousands staged an anti-Morsi demonstration Friday afternoon.

Meanwhile, Morsi's supporters, mainly of Islamist groups, continue their sit-in at Rabaa El-Adawiya Mosque in Cairo's Nasr City district.

Thousands staged a rally there Friday asserting Morsi's right to continue his term as president until the next elections, scheduled for 2016.

The open-ended demonstration, called for by 40 Islamists parties and groups — spearheaded by the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, from which Morsi hails — is being held under the banner, "Democratic legitimacy is a red line."

Egypt is anticipating mass nationwide protests Sunday aimed at bringing down Morsi and calling early presidential elections. The call for protests was first made by the Rebel campaign aimed at collecting 15 million signatures withdrawing confidence from Morsi. The campaign is backed by major opposition groups, including the National Salvation Front (NSF).

Tensions have been building between supporters and opponents of the president. Clashes broke out in several governorates over the past week leaving at least five dead, including two in Mediterranean city of Alexandria on Friday's protests there.

A three-hour speech by Morsi Wednesday night called for national reconciliation but was not well-received by the opposition.
