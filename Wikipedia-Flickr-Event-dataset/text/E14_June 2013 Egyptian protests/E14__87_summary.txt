Mass protests erupt against US-backed Mursi regime in EgyptBy Johannes Stern1 July 2013Egypt is witnessing a renewed upsurge of mass working class struggles.
Massive protests took place in all major cities throughout the countryâ€™s 27 governorates.
Other mass protests took place in Mansoura, Damanhour, Minya, Tanta, Sharqia and the Suez Canal cities of Port Said, Suez and Ismailia.
In some locations, protests took an insurrectionary character, and violent clashes between anti-government protesters and Mursi supporters erupted.
Only a few days ago, US Ambassador to Egypt Anne Patterson denounced protests against Mursi, effectively issuing a blank check to the Islamists to violently suppress the protests.
