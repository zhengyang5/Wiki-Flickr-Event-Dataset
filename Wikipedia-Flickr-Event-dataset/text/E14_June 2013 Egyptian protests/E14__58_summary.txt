Dubbed the “Couch Party,” this group stayed at home on their couches while millions valiantly poured into the streets.
This segment of the population, though it did little during the 18 days of revolution, represented an impenetrable, informal bloc.
Against all expectations, the campaign succeeded in penetrating the “Couch Party,” even garnering the support of countryside residents and traditional communities, like the Sufis.
Tamarrud’s public includes other kinds of “rebels,” such as a large segment of the youth who were politicized by the revolution.
The role of the army in the transitional period, if Tamarrud’s campaign bears fruit, remains a controversial matter.
