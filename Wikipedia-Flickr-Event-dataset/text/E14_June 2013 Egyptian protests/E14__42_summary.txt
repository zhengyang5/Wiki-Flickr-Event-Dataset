Image caption Egypt's military rulers promised a constitutional referendum ahead of new elections.
Egypt's military council suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament last month, meeting demands made by the opposition movement that ousted Mr Mubarak.
The Egyptian constitution had been written with built-in guarantees to keep Mr Mubarak and his political party in power.
He or she would also be obliged to appoint a deputy, something Mr Mubarak avoided until his last days in office.
In the meantime, Egypt's military council would issue a constitutional decree as a temporary measure.
