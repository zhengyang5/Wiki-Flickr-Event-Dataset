MONTREAL - The protest movement that has shaken Egypt echoed to Montreal Sunday as demonstrators gathered outside the Egyptian consulate in support of citizens gathered in the streets of Cairo.

Montreal Egyptians and supporters want the UN to publicly condemn the totalitarian regime of the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as policies in the United States and Middle East.



According to them, the United States supports the “rise of political Islam, the oppression of the people and the transformation of the region” into a den of terrorism.

The protesters called on Canada to not adhere to this position, saying it would only further damage Ottawa’s prestige on human rights internationally.

Others Egyptian opposition rallies were planned in Ottawa, Toronto and Calgary.

Montreal spokesperson Lilianne Issa argued that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi did not represent the entire population.
