Demonstrations continued on Tuesday evening at both the presidential palace and Al-Qobba Palace as protesters persisted in their calls for the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.
Thousands of protesters had arrived at the palace on Monday afternoon, many celebrating the ultimatum presented by the armed forces the day before.
Meanwhile at Al-Qobba Palace in Saraya Al-Qobba, demonstrators came in waves of hundreds, with thousands chanting by Tuesday evening.
Other protestors were more skeptical of the intentions of the armed forces, some challenging those who voiced support for them.
At the time of writing, hundreds continued to move towards Al-Qobba palace, while some with young families were beginning to leave.
