Protesters hold posters against U.S. Ambassor to Egypt Anne Patterson, left, with a message that translates to "crone go home."
(AP Photo/Hamada Elrasam)Egyptians demonstrating Sunday against President Mohamed Morsi's first year in office waved signs singling out U.S.
Ambassador Anne Patterson, telling her to "get out" and accusing her of clandestinely aiding Morsi's Islamist government.
But the United States has ongoing business with Egypt, after all, and letting relations sour might satisfy protesters' desires to punish Morsi, but would be unlikely to help.
President Obama, speaking in South Africa, said his "most immediate" concern over Egypt's protests was the safety of U.S. Embassy and consulate personnel.
