Massive protests have swept across Egypt once more, and this time they are even larger than the Arab Spring protests that ousted Hosni Mubarak in 2011.
Their anger is now directed at President Mohamed Morsi, whom many believe has lost his legitimacy after becoming the country's first democratically elected president.
From the BBC:The protesters accuse the country's first Islamist president of failing to tackle economic and security problems since taking power a year ago.
One protestor speaking with BBC News rejected the notion of allowing Morsi to stay in power, despite being the first freely-elected leader in Egypt in 60 years.
Photos taken by both journalists and citizens on Twitter show an incredible sea of bodies formed from Tahrir square to the front of the presidential palace.
