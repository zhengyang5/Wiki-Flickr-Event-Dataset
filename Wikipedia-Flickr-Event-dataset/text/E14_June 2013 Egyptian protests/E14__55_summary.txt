Organisers of the Tamarod petition campaign against President Mohamed Morsi reversed a statement made by the administrator of their official page which refused the endorsement of former Prime Minister and presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq.
On Thursday a statement was released on Tamarod’s official page denouncing the endorsement by Shafiq.
Tamarod is currently running several campaigns around the world to collect signatures from Egyptians abroad in time for Morsi’s one year anniversary as president.
Tamarod operates in the US, Canada and Mexico under the Tamarod North America umbrella, as well as similar campaigns in Europe, the Arab world and the Gulf.
Tamarod claims it has managed to secure over two million signatures for its campaign to call for early presidential elections.
