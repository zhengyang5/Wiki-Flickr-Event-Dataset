Morsi took power in 2011 after Egyptians flooded the streets to topple dictator Hosni Mubarak.
Many people at the Washington, DC rally communicated with those in Tahrir Square via Twitter and Facebook.
Mass protests also occurred in Egypt in Novemeber 2012 when Morsi decided to grant himself sweeping powers.
Tens of thousands have crowded into Tahrir Square in advance of the June 30 protest.
