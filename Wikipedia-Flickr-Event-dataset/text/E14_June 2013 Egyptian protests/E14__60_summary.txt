September 27, 2013Bahrain in Egypt’s Shadow By Kristin DiwanThe popular movement to overthrow the Mubarak government in Egypt in 2011 served as motivation for a political uprising in Bahrain.
In July 2013, Bahrain experienced a rash of crude bomb attacks on police patrols in Shia villages.
The following day the government banned political rallies including a pre-August 14 action that was planned by thecampaign.
Other amendments tightened regulations on social and charitable donations and penalized guardians for the participation of children in protests.In advance of the August 14 protests, security forces expanded arrests and detentions of activists including a well-known blogger, Mohammed Hassan.
Nonetheless, the intensified security environment in the country extended past August 14 and beyond the limited reach ofBahrain.While Bahrain political activists failed to appreciate the imperfect parallel of Egypt’s situation with that in Bahrain, the Bahrain government now embraced the new regional security environment heralded by the dark turn of events in Egypt.
