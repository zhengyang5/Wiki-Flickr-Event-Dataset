The Tamarod campaign launched on Wednesday a front to administer the 30 June protests and the transitional period likely to follow it.
Tamarod member Mona Selim stated that the Front resembles an operation room for planned protests, adding that it would start functioning upon its launch on Wednesday and continue until the “regime is toppled”.
The Front offered a roadmap for the phase which follows the hypothetical removal of President Mohamed Morsi.
Shady Al-Ghazaly Harb, another founding member, stated that this roadmap is the only remaining roadmap for the next phase.
Tamarod is a petition campaign formed in late April calling for early presidential elections.
