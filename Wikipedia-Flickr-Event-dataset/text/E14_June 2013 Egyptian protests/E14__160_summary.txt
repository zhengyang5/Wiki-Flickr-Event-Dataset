Iran on Tuesday called on the Egyptian military to support national reconciliation and respect the "vote of the people" after it warned it was ready to intervene in Egypt's political crisis.
"Mohamed Morsi is the incumbent president based on the people's vote," Iranian deputy foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian told the official IRNA news agency.
"It is expected of the armed forces of Egypt that they play their role in supporting national reconciliation and respect the vote of the people."
The Egyptian presidency rejected the ultimatum, insisting that Morsi would continue on his own path towards national reconciliation.
"Dividing the Egyptian nation yields no gain," he said, adding that respecting people's vote was "of utmost importance for Egypt's stability".
