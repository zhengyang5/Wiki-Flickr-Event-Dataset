The Egyptian newspaper Al Masry Al Youm is reporting that organizers of Sunday’s massive demonstrations protesting the rule of President Mohammed Morsi are so concerned that women might be sexually assaulted that they’ve set up a female-only protest zone in Tahrir Square.
The Popular Committees who are organizing the protests have cordoned off space near Mohammed Mahmoud Street and are setting up guards in special uniform to protect the women.
The report stated, “99.3 percent replied that they have been subjected to one form or another of harassment” calling the levels of sexual harassment “unprecedented.”The Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights reported in 2008 that two-thirds of Egyptian women experience sexual harassment daily.
On Sunday, thousands of Morsi opponents were gathering in the streets, waving flags and chanting slogans demanding he step down.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Morsi took office.
