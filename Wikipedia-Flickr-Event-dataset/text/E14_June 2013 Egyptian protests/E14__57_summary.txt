The Tamarod campaign has launched the 30 June Front, a body which includes a number of youth movements and political parties, to manage the transitional period that would follow the departure of President Mohamed Morsy.
At a news conference on Wednesday, the campaign, which is collecting signatures to demand early presidential elections, announced the members of the front, which include Ahmed Doma, Israa Abdel Fattah, Yousef al-Husseiny, and Shadi al-Ghazali Harb.
“Morsy has reneged on all his promises, failed to meet the minimum aspirations of Egyptians, and continued subordination to the West,” said campaign spokesperson Mohamed Abdel Aziz.
The transitional period would not exceed six months, after which presidential elections would be held under international and judicial supervision, to be followed by parliamentary elections.
The campaign called on all citizens to take to the streets on 30 June and demand the departure of Morsy.
