By Manar MohsenAs millions chanted for the fall of President Mohamed Morsi’s regime, Cairokee entertained hundreds of thousands with songs of revolution, hope and courage in a performance held on Monday evening at the protest outside the presidential palace.
Amir Eid, lead singer of Cairokee, said that he decided to perform at the protest because music gives him a way of expressing his views.
The audience served as backup singers, shaking the ground with their noise while managing to stay completely in tune.
“The performance was great and very relevant to what we are going through,” said Mohamed Farahat, a protester.
“This amount of positive energy and amazing vibe makes me wish we would have a revolution every day.”
