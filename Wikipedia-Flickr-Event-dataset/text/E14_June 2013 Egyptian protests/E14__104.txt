According to Ahram Online, the band tweeted “we will join the Egyptian people at Ittihadiya” before the performance.

According to Wasla.fm, an online radio station, the band name “Cairokee” is a combination of the words “Cairo” and “Karaoke,” which intends to mean that the group “singing along with Cairo.”

The band has five members; Amir Eid on vocals and rhythm, Tamer Hashem on drums, Adam El Alfy on bass guitar, Sherif Mostafa on keyboard, and Sherif Hawary on lead guitar.

Some of their famous hits include Ya, el Midan (Oh You, the Square) in reference to Cairo’s iconic Tahrir Square.

UAE-based The National newspaper described this song as “a touching duet about Egypt's awakening political consciousness” in a review of the band.

The group was set to perform at 5 p.m. (local time) on Monday, however the group announced on social media that the show would be postponed till later in the evening.

The band thanked all their supporters who sang with them during their performance and was met with requests to perform again at planned protests on Tuesday night.
