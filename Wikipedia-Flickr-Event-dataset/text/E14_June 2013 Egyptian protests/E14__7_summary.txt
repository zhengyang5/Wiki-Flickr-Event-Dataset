Inside, the Mubarak-appointed chief prosecutor, Abdel Meguid Mahmoud, declared to a crowd of cheering judges that he rejected Mr. Morsi’s attempt to fire him.
Khaled Ali, a human rights lawyer, said he had filed one of several lawsuits asking the courts to attempt to overturn Mr. Morsi’s decree.
Top courts had already dissolved both an earlier Constitutional Assembly and the Parliament.
To Mr. Morsi’s supporters, it was a vindication of the theory that judges and the opposition meant to block the assembly’s work entirely.
Most of those protesters appeared unconcerned, if cynical, about Mr. Morsi’s decree, though some approved of his efforts to fire the Mubarak-appointed prosecutor and retry officials previously acquitted of responsibility for the killings.
