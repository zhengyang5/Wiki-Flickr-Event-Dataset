Two-hundred-and-fifty fishing boats on Sunday sailed in the Nile to al-Saa Square in Damietta in protest against President Mohamed Morsy.
The fishermen used megaphones to chant slogans against Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood as tens of thousands of Egyptians marched against the Islamist regime across Egypt.
