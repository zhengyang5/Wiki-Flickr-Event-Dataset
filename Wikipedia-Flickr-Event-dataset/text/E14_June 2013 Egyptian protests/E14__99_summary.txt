Opponents of President Mohamed Morsi have attempted to storm the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo, the organizationâ€™s spokesman said.
Millions took to the streets on Sunday to demand the resignation of President Mohamed Morsi on the first anniversary of his inauguration.
Regional offices of the Muslim Brotherhood, and its political affiliate, the Freedom and Justice Party, have come under a barrage of attacks over the past week.
Earlier on Sunday, anti-Morsi activists ransacked the local Muslim Brotherhood office, and tried to break into a school, claiming the Islamist movement used it to store weapons.
The Health Ministry has said seven people were killed and hundreds were wounded in clashes across the country on Sunday.
