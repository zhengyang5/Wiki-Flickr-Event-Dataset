While insisting they want no direct role in national politics, the generals appeared instead to be pressuring Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected president, to restructure his government.
The protesters in Tahrir Square, who listened to the military statement on radios and cell phones, cheered as it was read.
Morsy, a U.S.-educated Islamist, was elected Egypt's president in June 2012.
On Monday, protesters stormed the main headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the party that Morsy led before his election.
Monday's military statement seemed to adopt the protesters' perspective, calling the crisis a grave threat to national security while praising demonstrators as determined and admirable.
