By Mohamad NagiProtesters shut down the Port Said Investment Authority on Wednesday as a form of civil disobedience, said a local activist.
In Qaliubiya, Al-Dostour Party member Waleed Mohamed said that the main governorate building in the capital Banha has been closed since Friday.
“This is the main building that controls all of the other facilities below it; this symbolises the governorate as a whole,” El-Naggar explained.
“Once this was closed, the rest [of the government facilities] slowed down.”He added that all of the political parties and groups agreed upon the civil disobedience.
“This will be a message to all future rulers that if they don’t respect us, this will happen to [them] too.”Several political parties and groups have called for widespread civil disobedience, including Tamarod, Al-Dostour Party, and the Center for Trade Union and Worker Services.
