“We are following with great concern the extremely tense situation in Egypt and wish to convey a strong message of solidarity and support to the Egyptian people,” the Spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Rupert Colville, told reporters in Geneva.
Yesterday, Egypt’s army said that the country’s rival parties have 48 hours to resolve the political crisis.
“We urge the Egyptian Government to continue to make every effort to protect the rights of citizens to engage in peaceful protests and demonstrations,” Mr. Colville said, stressing that any perpetrators of attacks against peaceful demonstrators who are found to have used excessive force should be held accountable.
“We welcome public assurances made by the law enforcement agencies and the military that no measures will be taken that could lead to excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators.”Yesterday, the Secretary-General repeated his call for all parties to uphold the law, while respecting the right to demonstrate peacefully.
In particular, he underlined that this right must be extended to female demonstrators, given the concerns over the high number of reports of sexual assaults.
