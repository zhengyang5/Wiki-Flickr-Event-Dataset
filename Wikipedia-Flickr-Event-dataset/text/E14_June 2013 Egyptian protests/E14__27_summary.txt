Morsy refused to bow to the ultimatum, setting the stage for a possible showdown.
"I have no choice but to bear responsibility for the Egyptian constitution."
Morsy gave no indication of stepping down, sharing power or calling early elections, saying he was calling on the military to withdraw its ultimatum and return to its rightful work.
"The reports that we have been urging early elections are inaccurate," Jen Psaki told reporters.
The officials said the United States has also warned the Egyptian military that a coup would trigger U.S. legislation that calls for cutting off all American aid.
