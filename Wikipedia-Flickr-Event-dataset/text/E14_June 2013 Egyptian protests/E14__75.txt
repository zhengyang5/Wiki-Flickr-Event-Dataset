Huge numbers of Egyptians gathered in Cairo on Sunday to protest the government of President Mohamed Morsi, sworn in one year ago, as a smaller number of Morsi supporters gathered in a different part of town.

Read Abigail Hauslohner's story to get a sense of the tension in Cairo, where protesters are hoping to topple Morsi's year-old rule and many fear the demonstrations could devolve into violence. CNN's Ben Wedeman, a veteran of the region, called Sunday's anti-Morsi demonstration the largest public protest he'd ever seen in Egypt.

Photos of the protests drive home their vast size and scale, still remarkable even two-plus years after mass demonstrations led to the end of Hosni Mubarak's reign.
