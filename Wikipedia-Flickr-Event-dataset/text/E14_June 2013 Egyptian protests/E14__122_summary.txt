Thousands of Morsi supporters took to the streets in a march from Giza's Haram Street and Omraniya district to Al-Nahda Square outside Cairo University, the site of previous pro-Morsi rallies.
Carrying placards depicting President Morsi, protesters chanted: "[The president's democratic] legitimacy is a red line."
Protesters reportedly left El-Nasr Mosque after evening prayers, chanting, "Down with military rule," "Egypt's legitimacy is with the president" and "We love you Morsi."
In the northern city of Suez, supporters and opponents of the presidency reportedly exchanged gunfire near the mouth of the Suez Canal Monday night, according to witnesses quoted by Reuters.
Pro-Morsi protests have also erupted in the northern Marsa Matrouh governorate and in the Upper Egyptian governorates of Minya and Qena.
