Days earlier, on June 30, 2013, massive street protests called for new presidential elections.
Egypt’s military, he promised, would stay out of post-Morsi politics.
Only later would the role of Egypt’s military and Interior Ministry stimulating the movement become apparent.
Interviews with Interior Ministry officials and former Tamarod members highlight how the security apparatus fomented street protests against the Morsi government.
In my own research, I counted more than 140 anti-Morsi protests on June 30, as reported in Egyptian news media.
