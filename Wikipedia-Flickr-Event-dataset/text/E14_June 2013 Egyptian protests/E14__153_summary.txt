Without any enforcement of the law on trade union, democratic and independent unions are still denied and around 650 workers have been dismissed for their union activities.
The Muslim Brotherhoodâ€™s promise for the trade union rights and decent minimum wage was becomes nullified.
On the occasion of the Mass Rally on June 30, KCTU once again extends its support and solidarity to the Egyptian workers and people.
The struggle of Egyptian people is our struggle.
