Egypt's tourism minister has resigned in protest over the appointment as Luxor governor of a member of a hardline Islamist group associated with terrorists who killed at least 58 tourists in 1997.
The city is home to some of the country's most famous pharaonic ruins, and derives most of its income from tourism.
One of 17 governors appointed this week, Khayat was not the only appointee to have been greeted with outrage.
Fighting broke out between activists and Brotherhood members in Tanta, Egypt's fifth-largest city, where the new Brotherhood governor was attacked with a shoe.
He's going down on the 30th," added Abdel Samir, referring to planned protests against Morsi's regime on 30 June, the first anniversary of his election.
