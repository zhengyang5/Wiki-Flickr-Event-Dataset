Egyptian artists gathered once again outside the culture ministry in Cairo's Tamale district, later walking towards Tahrir Square to join a massive crowd gathered there.
Tuesday's march comes only two days after artists and intellectuals staged the largest protest march since the January 2011 revolution.
The march included artists of all generations and fields: filmmakers, theatre makers, musicians and visual artists, among others.
For artists and intellectuals, Tuesday's march to Tahrir was the second march within two days.
On 30 June, the number of artists and intellectuals who marched was in the thousands.
