What remains to be argued and fleshed out is how this new constitution would be formed.
By an elected or an appointed constituent assembly?
The Egyptians, whether they have elections for parliament or for a constituent assembly, should do the same.
The constitution should be followed by presidential and parliamentary elections conducted in accordance with the regulations elaborated by this constitution.
Now that the 1971 constitution has been given a new life this would be tantamount to reviving the old regime.
