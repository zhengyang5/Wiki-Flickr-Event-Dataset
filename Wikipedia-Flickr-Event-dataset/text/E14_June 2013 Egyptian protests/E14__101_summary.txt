The headquarters of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood have been burned and ransacked following an all-night siege â€“ one day after millions protested on Egypt's streets calling for President Mohamed Morsi's resignation.
Bystanders said that some Brotherhood members were injured and handed to the authorities during the blaze.
Once the other Brotherhood members fled, protesters stormed the compound and accelerated the blaze.
The Brotherhood itself believes that though Mohamed Morsi is a sympathiser, the state is still controlled by officials loyal to ousted dictator Hosni Mubarak.
"I feel victorious," said Ahmed Badawy, a Cairo resident shot in the hand by birdshot fired by Brotherhood members during the night.
