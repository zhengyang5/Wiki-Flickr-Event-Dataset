CAIRO (Reuters) - Millions of Egyptians flooded into the streets on the first anniversary of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi’s inauguration on Sunday to demand that he resign in the biggest challenge so far to rule by his Muslim Brotherhood.
The liberal opposition National Salvation Front coalition declared victory in what it styled “Revolutionary Communique No.
1” saying the masses had “confirmed the downfall of the regime of Mohamed Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood”.
Protesters opposing Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi hold the metal signage of the national headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood after attacking it in Cairo's Moqattam district June 30, 2013.
Mursi and the Brotherhood hope the protests will fizzle as previous outbursts did in December and January.
