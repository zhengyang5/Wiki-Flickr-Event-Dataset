Egypt’s largest opposition bloc on Saturday reached out to former members of the deposed president’s party, ahead of mass protests on June 30 demanding the ouster of his successor.
“I can’t isolate millions of Egyptian people because they were part of the National Democratic Party,” said Mohamed ElBaradei, a top leader of the opposition National Salvation Front, referring to Mubarak’s now-dissolved party.
The country’s Supreme Administrative Court in 2011 ruled that party members can participate in elections.
A yet-untested “political isolation” clause in the new constitution may ban senior officials in the now-defunct party from top posts.
The opposition accuses Mursi of monopolizing power and of failing to deliver on promises to create an inclusive system where the opposition is represented.
