Facing fierce pressure from Islamists, Egypt's top general on Sunday said the decision to remove Islamist Mohamed Morsi from the presidency was made in response to what he called the will of the people.General Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi spoke Sunday on national television, for the first time since Morsi's July 3 ouster.
He said Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, had lost legitimacy because of mass protests by his opponents.
But he rejected accusations the removal was religiously motivated.Morsi has been held at an undisclosed location since his removal, while scores of senior members of his Muslim Brotherhood Party have been taken into custody.
Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns is meeting with authorities in Cairo from Sunday to Tuesday in the first visit by a high-ranking U.S. official since Morsi's removal.
"Washington also has called on Egypt's interim leadership to avoid a politically motivated crackdown on the deposed president and his supporters.
