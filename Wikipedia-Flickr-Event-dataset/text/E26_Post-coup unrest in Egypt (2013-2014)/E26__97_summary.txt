Human Rights Watch on Sunday condemned the deaths of more than 70 people in violence that erupted at protests in Egypt, accusing authorities of a "criminal disregard for people's lives".
At least 72 people were killed in Cairo alone on Saturday morning, according to the health ministry, at a rally of supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.
Protesters accused security forces of opening fire with live ammunition, but the interior ministry said only tear gas had been used.
The deaths came after rival rallies by supporters and opponents of Morsi on Friday.
The deaths in Cairo on Saturday were the bloodiest incident since his ouster, and raised new fears about the country's transition.
