The 'Rebel' (Tamarod) movement that first called for mass 30 June protests has taken up army chied Abdel Fattah El-Sisi's call for mass demonstrations Friday to mandate the army and police to crackdown on "violence and terrorism," Al-Ahram Arabic news website reported.
At a press conference for revolutionary forces Thursday, Tamarod, a grassroots campaign that gathered 22 million signatures demanding that Mohamed Morsi resign, said that it supports the military in its "war against terrorism."
El-Sisi's call for Friday mass demonstrations has been turned down by some revolutionary anti-Morsi groups, such as the April 6 Youth Movement and the Revolutionary Socialists.
Similarly, Egypt's Revolutionary Socialists denounced El-Sisi's speech, saying they will not take to the streets Friday to give the army a "blank cheque to commit massacres."
El-Sisi's call follows a series of violent clashes nationwide after the ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi 3 July and the appointment of the head of the High Constitutional Court, Adly Mansour, as interim president.
