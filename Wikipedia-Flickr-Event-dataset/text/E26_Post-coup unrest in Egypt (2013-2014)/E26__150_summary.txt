Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses to the shooting and analyzed 18 photographs and three videos.
One video that shows security forces dispersing the protest captured what appears to be the moment that al-Sabbagh was shot.
“The demonstration was simply 30 people carrying some roses, half of them were old guys, and the street was empty,” he wrote to Human Rights Watch.
Al-Ela confirmed his written account in a later interview with Human Rights Watch.
Given the Egyptian government’s failure to hold authorities responsible, Human Rights Watch has previously called for a commission of inquiry at the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate.
