CAIRO, December 9 (RIA Novosti) - Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has decided to annul his constitutional declaration expanding his powers, a spokesman for a meeting between Morsi and the country’s political leaders said on Sunday.
“The decision has been made to issue a new constitutional declaration,” Islamist politician Selim al-Awa said after the meeting.
“The country’s political forces and the president, who gathered on Saturday to hold a national dialog, have agreed to establish a commission to amend the constitutional declaration,” Qandil said.
Morsi's constitutional declaration expanded his executive authority by barring the courts from challenging his decisions.
