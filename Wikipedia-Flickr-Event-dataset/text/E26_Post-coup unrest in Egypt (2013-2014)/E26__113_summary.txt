In a Cairo mosque lie the charred and mutilated bodies of more than 200 Egyptians, apparently uncounted and unacknowledged by the state after security forces crushed Islamist protest camps.
Protesters' tent cities were set ablaze on Wednesday after the security forces moved in, apparently accounting for the charred state of some of the bodies.
Medics at the scene said the bodies had been moved straight to the mosque from a protest camp nearby.
More still lay in the remains of the camp, but security forces were preventing the mosque helpers from retrieving them, she said.
At the mosque, men joined hands to make a linked fence to let families looking for their relatives' corpses enter and exit.
