Reuters - Five people died in a bomb blast and clashes that broke out between security forces and protesters on Thursday marking the first anniversary of the army's ouster of elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.
In the weeks and months after the ouster, security forces launched a crackdown that saw thousands of Brotherhood members detained and hundreds killed.
CloseSince Morsi's ouster, militant Islamist groups have launched a campaign of bombings and shootings targeting security forces in the sprawling capital.
A call by Islamist opponents of Morsi's ouster for mass demonstrations appeared to fall flat on Thursday.
