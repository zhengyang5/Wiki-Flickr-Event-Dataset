Five were killed, including a 14-year-old boy, on Friday in clashes between supporters and opponents of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, according to the head of the health ministry's emergency sector.
Anas El-Kady, spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood in Alexandria, claimed in a press statement earlier in the day that two of the slain were supporters of the ousted president.
At least 146 were injured in the clashes, according to state-owned news agency MENA.
According to Ahramâ€™s Arabic news website, security forces fired teargas in the vicinity of the clashes to disperse protesters.
Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, meanwhile, had called for demonstrations on Friday to demand the reinstatement of the Islamist president, ousted on 3 July by the military after mass protests against his rule.
