Five were killed, including a 14-year-old boy, on Friday in clashes between supporters and opponents of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, according to the head of the health ministry's emergency sector.

Ibrahim El-Roubi told Al-Ahram Arabic news website that the boy was stabbed with a bladed weapon in his stomach. Another man was shot in the head, he added.



Anas El-Kady, spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood in Alexandria, claimed in a press statement earlier in the day that two of the slain were supporters of the ousted president.

At least 146 were injured in the clashes, according to state-owned news agency MENA. According to Amr Nasr, the head of the ambulance authority in Alexandria, most of the injuries were caused by birdshot and bladed weapons.

The clashes reportedly broke out in Mahatet Al-Raml district in Egypt’s second-largest city after pro-military protesters who were marching against “terrorism” passed near a demonstration by supporters of Morsi at Al-Qaed Ibrahim Mosque.

According to Ahram’s Arabic news website, security forces fired teargas in the vicinity of the clashes to disperse protesters.

At Sidi Gaber station, around four kilometres from downtown Alexandria, hundreds of protesters have gathered holding pictures of army chief and defence minister Abdel Fattah El-Sisi , chanting “no to terrorism."

Rival mass rallies are taking place in a number of locations in Egypt on Friday.

Army chief El-Sisi on Wednesday called on Egyptians to protest in order to give the military a "mandate" to confront “violence and terrorism” triggered by Morsi's overthrow.

Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, meanwhile, had called for demonstrations on Friday to demand the reinstatement of the Islamist president, ousted on 3 July by the military after mass protests against his rule.
