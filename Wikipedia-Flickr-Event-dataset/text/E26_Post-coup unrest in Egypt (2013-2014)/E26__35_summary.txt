The Egyptian army has overthrown President Mohamed Morsi, announcing a roadmap for the countryâ€™s political future that will be implemented by a national reconciliation committee.
According to a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi is being held in a military facility with top aides.
"Morsi and the entire presidential team are under house arrest in the Presidential Republican Guards Club," Gehad El-Haddad, the son of a top Morsi aide, told AFP news agency on Thursday.
In a televised broadcast, flanked by military leaders, religious authorities and political figures, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi effectively declared the removal of Morsi.
Egypt's second largest Islamist group, the Nour party, said in a statement that it agreed to the army roadmap in order to avoid further conflict.
