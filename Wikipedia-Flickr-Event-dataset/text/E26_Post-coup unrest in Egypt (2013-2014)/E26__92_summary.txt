Egyptian rights groups have expressed deep concerns over the army's call to Egyptians to take to the streets to grant a mandate to tackle terrorism, fearing that an unlawful crackdown is imminent.
The incident signified an escalation in methods of violence since the outbreak of unrest after the army's overthrow of the country's Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.
In a joint Thursday statement, seven human rights organizations voiced alarm about current Egyptian laws which they say not only criminalize terrorism, but, in effect, criminalize what is regarded as freedom of expression.
Among groups endorsing the statement are the Cairo Institute for Human Rights, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, and the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights.
Rights groups argued that rising militancy in the restive Sinai Peninsula is not an impulse for granting the army a mandate.
