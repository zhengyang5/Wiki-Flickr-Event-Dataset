A student supporter of deposed president Mohamed Morsi has been shot dead during clashes with security forces at Al-Azhar University.
Police stormed the campus late on Wednesday as violence flared between students throwing petrol bombs and police replying with teargas, state news agency MENA reported.
The clashes on Wednesday came hours after the university administration banned protests on campus and suspended student union activity in response to the turmoil sweeping the university.
Egypt's army, prompted by mass protests, deposed Morsi on 3 July, throwing the country into violent political turmoil.
Last week, a court sentenced 12 pro-Morsi students to 17 years in prison for storming the headquarters of Al-Azhar in October.
