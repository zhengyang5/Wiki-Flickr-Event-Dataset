Announcing the step was unusual: typically prosecutors wait until charges are filed before making public statements.Badie and several other Brotherhood officials already face charges for inciting violence that were announced earlier this week, but most of them have not been arrested.The prosecutors did not say who had made the complaints.
However, the Brotherhood has shown its organisational muscle by keeping its vigil running into a third week and bringing in coachloads of supporters from the provinces during the Ramadan fasting month.At one stage overnight, demonstrators stood behind barbed wire shouting at soldiers a few dozen metres (yards) away.
"I am here to say 'no' to the military coup and 'yes' to Morsi, who I see as my legitimate president," said Ahmed Adel, a 22-year-old student, in downtown Cairo.Senior Brotherhood figure Essam El-Erian, one of those who faces arrest, called on his Facebook page for more demonstrations on July 15.
