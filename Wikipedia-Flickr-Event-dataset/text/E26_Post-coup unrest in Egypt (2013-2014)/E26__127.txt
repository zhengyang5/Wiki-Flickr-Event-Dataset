Egypt's health ministry announced in a statement on Friday evening that a 15-year-old boy, Ihab Ahmed Selim, was killed by a gunshot wound he sustained during the clashes.

Earlier on Friday, a protester was announced dead in Alexandria when clashes erupted between hundreds of supporters and opponents of Morsi, although his identity was still unknown.

The health ministry added that five were injured during the clashes in Alexandria and four others were injured in scuffles across Cairo on Friday.

Security forces then intervened firing tear gas to break up the crowd and arresting a number of Morsi's supporters.

Another 13-year-old boy was killed in Alexandria on Friday evening following the clashes, a security official confirmed to Ahram Online.

The boy was hit by a public transport bus while attempting to escape security forces that were attempting to disperse the crowd, the Middle East News Agency Mena (MENA) reported.

A pro-Morsi coalition had called for mass demonstrations on Friday to denounce the ongoing trial of the toppled leader and commemorate the 90-day anniversary of the forcible dispersal of the two main pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo on 14 August, during which hundreds of protesters were killed.

In response to the call, hundreds of protesters gathered in Cairo, Giza and Alexandria for the first Friday without a nightly curfew in force since the day of the dispersal.

At the same time in Alexandria, hundreds of supporters of the country's interim leaders rallied in the central Qaed Ibrahim mosque to voice their backing for the Egyptian army that removed Morsi amid mass protests against his rule and to denounce "terrorism," Al-Ahramâ€™s Arabic website reported.
