Despite deep misgivings about Mr Morsi, the US tried to maintain a working relationship with him.
Since Mr Morsi was ousted, Washington has called for an end to arbitrary arrests but had avoided calling specifically for his release - for fear of provoking a backlash in Cairo by the anti-Morsi crowd.
But after Germany said Mr Morsi should be freed from house arrest, the US was put on the spot, adds our correspondent.
On Thursday, Washington had urged Egypt's leadership to stop the "arbitrary" arrests of Muslim Brotherhood members, warning against targeting any particular group.
Mr Morsi was removed on 3 July - a year after he was elected - following nationwide protests by millions of people; an interim president, Adly Mansour, was installed.
