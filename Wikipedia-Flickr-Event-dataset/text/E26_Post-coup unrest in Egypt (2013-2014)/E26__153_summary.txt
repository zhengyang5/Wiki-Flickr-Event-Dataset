At least 51 protestors and three members of security forces were killed and 435 people were injured Monday in bloody clashes outside a military building in Cairo, as thousands continued to demand change in Egyptâ€™s leadership.
Fox News sources who were at the scene shortly after the shooting described seeing Muslim Brotherhood supporters with large chest wounds and fatal gunshot wounds in their backs.
Morsi supporters have been holding rallies and a sit-in outside the Republican Guard building since the military deposed Morsi last week during massive protests against him.
Besides the Republican Guard sit-in, they are also holding thousands-strong daily rallies at a nearby mosque.
A statement by the armed forces published on the state news agency said "an armed terrorist group" tried to storm the Republican Guard building, killing one officer and seriously injuring six.
