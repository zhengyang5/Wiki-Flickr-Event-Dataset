Clashes have taken place between opponents and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood near Cairo's Tahrir Square after anti-Morsi demonstrators quickly filled the square, following reports of violence in its vicinity.
Millions filled Egypt's streets last week demanding Mohamed Morsi to step down as president and for early elections.
"Protests in support of former president Mohamed Morsi are designed to increase the pressure for a political solution to the current crisis," Ahmed Sobei of the Muslim Brotherhood told Ahram Online.
Egyptâ€™s Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya Islamist group, a key ally of the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted president Mohamed Morsi, announced a proposal on Friday that includes holding a referendum on Morsi's return to power.
Raafat Shehata, who had been appointed head of General Intelligence by Mohamed Morsi in September 2012, was given the role of presidential advisor for security affairs.
