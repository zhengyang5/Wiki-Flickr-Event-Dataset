One person was killed in Kafr Al-Sheikh governorate, and 13 were arrested in Matariyah district in Cairo, while participating in anti-government protests on Friday.
In Matariyah, a working class district in North Cairo, 13 protesters were arrested on charges of “organising protests and possession of weapons”.
Matariyah neighbourhood became a flashpoint for violent confrontations between Islamist groups and security forces ever since the ouster of Morsi last year.
On 29 November, the district witnessed protests engineered by the Salafi Front, a political Islamist organisation, leaving one person killed and other injured.
During the events of the 25 January Revolution, the neighbourhood witnessed large anti-government demonstrations and confrontations with the security forces.
