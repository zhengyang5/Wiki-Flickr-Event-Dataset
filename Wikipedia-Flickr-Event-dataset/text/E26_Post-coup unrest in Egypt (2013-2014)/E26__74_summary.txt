At least three people were killed and 17 wounded early on Monday in Egypt’s North Sinai province following a suspected militant attack on a bus carrying workers employed at a cement factory.
The suspected militants used rocket-propelled grenades in the attack, according to security and medical sources.
Three people died and 17 were injured in the attack,” a security official told AFP news agency.
The restive Sinai peninsula has been hit by a surge of violence since president Mohammed Mursi’s ouster on July 3, with militants killing a police officer early on Friday.
A Coptic Christian man was found decapitated a day earlier, while two people died in an attack on a checkpoint in the peninsula on Wednesday.
