The Tamarod movement which started the protest against deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi posted on its Twitter account a statement which rejects the edict released by Interim President Adli Mansour.

"Mansour's maneuvers will create a new dictatorship," the statement reads. Mansour released an edict according to which an amended constitution will be submitted for a referendum in four months, two months later the parliamentary elections will be held and a week later the presidential elections' date will be set.
