More than 800 civilians and 70 members of the security forces have been killed in violence since a crackdown on Morsi supporters began Wednesday.
Security forces, however, closed roads and deployed tanks to choke off protests in Cairo, blunting the usually impressive ability of the Brotherhood to turn out its supporters.
The interim government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and declared a state of emergency to try to restore order and curtail protests over Morsi’s removal.
Some participants in pro-Morsi demonstrations, however, have also brandished weapons, despite a call from the Brotherhood to keep the protests peaceful.
An increasing number of U.S. lawmakers are calling for a suspension of Washington’s $1.5 billion in annual military aid to Egypt because of the crackdown on Morsi supporters.
