Egypt's Shura Council was dissolved by Wednesday's military statement that also deposed President Mohamed Morsi, a judicial source has told Al-Ahram Arabic news website.

The legislative chamber will not reconvene because the constitution has been temporarily suspended until a new one is drawn up and put to a referendum. Fresh presidential and parliamentary elections will then take place.

In early June, the law that regulated the council's elections was ruled unconstitutional by the High Consitutional Court (HCC).

However, the Islamist-dominated council had been granted immunity from dissolution by the now-suspended constitution.

The council had held legislative powers since the lower house was dissolved by a separate court ruling.

Egyptian army chief Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi announced the ouster of Mohamed Morsi on Wednesday and said HCC chief Adly Mansour would become interim president until fresh elections are held.

Mansour was appointed HCC head in May. But his term only started on 30 June after the retirement of former head Maher El-Beheiry.

Armoured vehicles and metal barriers now surround the HCC building in the upscale Cairo district of Maadi.
