The first round of Egypt's presidential election, in May, pitted thirteen candidates against each other. They spanned a range of ideologies: former generals and spies, conservative Islamists, Nasserists and liberal activists.

The runoff involved just two candidates: Mohammed Morsi, from the Muslim Brotherhood; and Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under deposed president Hosni Mubarak.
