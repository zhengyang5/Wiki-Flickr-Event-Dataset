Al Jazeera's Nicole Johnston, reporting from the pro-Morsi rally in Alexandria, said that "the numbers have really swelled after people broke their fast for Ramadan."
Their demonstrations have been far smaller since the mass rallies clamouring for Morsi's resignation in the days leading to the coup.
Meanwhile, reports emerged on Friday that Al Jazeera Network channels, which include Al Jazeera English, Al Jazeera Arabic, and Al Jazeera Mubashr Misr, are intermittently being jammed in Egypt.
In a statement issued on Friday, the pro-Morsi coalition urged its supporters to remain peaceful and "adhere to civilised behaviour".
Morsi's supporters are also staging sit-ins outside a mosque in the Nasr City district, and near Cairo University.
