A Hamas official says elements within the interim Egyptian government colluded with their opponents to demonise them.
Salah, al-Bardaweel, a member of Hamas, said during a press conference on Tuesday that political rivals Fatah, as well as members of the Palestinian Authority, the governing body in the occupied West Bank, pushed forward a malicious agenda to tarnish Hamas.
Abdullah Abdullah, a member of Fatah based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, told Al Jazeera that "it is unfortunate that Hamas sinks to that level, and forges documents".
"Fatah is in defence of every Palestinian, including Hamas numbers, so its really a pity that Hamas sinks to that level.
Morsi is detained pending investigations, including spying for Hamas to attack police institutions and break into Egyptian prisons during the revolution, as well assisting Hamas in kidnapping officers and soldiers.
