Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis claimed responsibility Sunday for a helicopter crash in North Sinai on Saturday.
Five military personnel were killed when a military helicopter crashed in the Sinai Peninsula Saturday, AFP reported in breaking news, quoting medical sources.
The statement attributed to Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis said they targeted the aircraft using a missile near Sheikh Zuwayed, Saturday, killing the crew.
It apologized for claiming responsibility for recent bombings in Cairo by mistake, saying confusion occurred because Agnad Misr operated in the vicinity of Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis's activity in Cairo.
The statement said Agnad Misr carried out a bombing on Friday near a metro station in Cairo and that each group carried out an operation against Talebeya Police Station.
