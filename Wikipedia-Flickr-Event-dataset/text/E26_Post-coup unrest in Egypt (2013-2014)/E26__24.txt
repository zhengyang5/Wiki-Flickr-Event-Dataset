More than 22 million people have signed a petition in Egypt demanding the departure of Islamist President Mohammad Mursi and a snap election, the opposition Tamarod (Arabic for rebellion) group said on Saturday, according to AFP.



“Our petition has gathered 22,134,465 signatures,” Tamarod spokesman Mahmud Badr told journalists on the eve of Sunday’s first anniversary of Mursi’s inauguration when it has called for nationwide protests.

According to The Associated Press, at least six Egyptians have been killed in days of clashes ahead of nationwide protests Sunday demanding Mursi’s removal.

Thousands of Egyptians gathered in Cairo on Friday in two opposing mass rallies, one calling for the Mursi’s ouster, and another showing support for the embattled Islamist president.
