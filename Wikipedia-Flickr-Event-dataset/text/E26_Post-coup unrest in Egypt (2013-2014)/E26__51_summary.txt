Cairo remains on edge this after yesterday's “Day of Rage” declared by supporters of the deposed President Mohamed Morsi was marked by gunfire, dead bodies and vows of revenge and Egypt slipped further towards a future of uncertainty and fear.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for demonstrators to be protected after army removed Mr Morsi from power.
Three days after the military pushed out Mr Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the country appears to be heading towards further conflict and turmoil.
The former President, Mohamed Morsi, raised public sector wages, which helped push the annual budget deficit to 14 per cent of GDP.
However, Mr Morsi did expand welfare programmes for the poorest, boosted wheat production to wean the country off food imports, and explored new ways for the government to raise debt.
