CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian policeman and a militant were killed when security forces raided a hideout used by radical Islamists near Alexandria on Wednesday, and a senior officer was killed near Cairo when a bomb blew up his car, the Interior Ministry said.
Attacks claimed by Islamist militants have killed around 500 people since last July, mostly policemen and soldiers.
Another militant group called Ajnad Misr, or Soldiers of Egypt, has also claimed responsibility for attacks.
The police officer killed near Cairo on Wednesday was named as Brigadier General Ahmed Zaki.
It has also claimed responsibility for a February 16 attack that killed three South Korean tourists in the Sinai Peninsula.
