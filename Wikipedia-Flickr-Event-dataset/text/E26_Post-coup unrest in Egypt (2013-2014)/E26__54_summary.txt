A presidential spokesman has said that talks are continuing over the appointment of a new interim prime minister for Egypt, following earlier reports that opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei had been chosen.
Authorities said there were several options for the position and acknowledged that there had been strong opposition to the possible appointment of ElBaradei.
Also on Saturday, the presidential spokesman said the Muslim Brotherhood would be able to take part in new elections.
"The Muslim Brotherhood has plenty of opportunities to run for all elections including the coming presidential elections or the ones to follow."
The Al Nour Party's deputy leader Ahmed Khalil told the state news website Al-Ahram that the party would withdraw from the political transition process if ElBaradei was confirmed in his post.
