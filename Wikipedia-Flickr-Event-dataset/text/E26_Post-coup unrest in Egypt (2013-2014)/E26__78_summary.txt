The family of ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi has accused the country's military of "kidnapping" him, and says it holds the military responsible for his safety and security.
The statement is the first from Morsi's family since the military overthrew him on July 3.
"We are taking local and international legal measures against Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the leader of the bloody military coup, and his putschist group," Shaimaa Mohamed Morsi told reporters.
Morsi has been held incommunicado at an undisclosed location since the military coup.
"We warn Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi and his coup leaders against harming the life, health or safety of the legitimate president, our father."
