Egypt: More than 100 killed in Cairo massacreCairo witnesses most deadly state-led massacre since Mubarak's ousterLondon, Asharq Al-Awsat—More than 100 people have been reported killed by security officials in Egypt in what represents the worst state-led massacre since former president Hosni Mubarak’s ouster.
Egypt’s health ministry reported on Saturday that 38 people were killed, while the Muslim Brotherhood claimed that at least 139 people were killed and 4,500 others wounded in the attack.
Ibrahim said that the Rabaa Al-Adawiya protests would be “brought to an end soon and in a legal manner,” with an order from the public prosecutor.
It is not yet known whether Saturday’s violence was part of a sanctioned attempt to oust the pro-Mursi supporters from Rabaa Al-Adawiya square.
More than 250 people have been killed in Egypt in clashes and violence following Mursi’s ouster.
