Egyptian police stand guard outside the police academy in Cairo on September 27, 2014Two people were killed Friday when supporters of Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi clashed with police and residents outside Cairo, security officials said.
In the province of Fayoum, south of the capital, violence erupted after Morsi supporters staged a protest following Friday prayers, leading to the death of a 19-year-old student.
Supporters of Morsi still attempt to stage protests demanding his reinstatement, but their rallies have dwindled amid a deadly government crackdown since the army ousted the Islamist last year.
At least 1,400 people have been killed in the crackdown, while more than 15,000 have been jailed and hundreds sentenced to death.
The authorities have tightened security around universities after more than a dozen students were killed in violence sparked by pro-Morsi protests during the last academic year.
