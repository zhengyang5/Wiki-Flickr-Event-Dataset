A woman was killed on Saturday in Cairo after the police fired shotgun pellets at a handful of socialist activists marching to Tahrir Square with flowers to commemorate the hundreds of demonstrators killed there during the revolution that began on Jan. 25, 2011, witnesses said.

The protester, Shaimaa al-Sabbagh, was shot at close range and died a short time later, according to a statement from the organizers of the march reported by Aswat Masriya, a local news site supported by the Thomson Reuters foundation.

News photographs taken before the march was attacked showed the protesters holding a wreath of flowers and a banner that read: “The fourth anniversary of the martyrs who died during the January 25 revolution.”

Egyptian activists shared graphic images of Ms. Sabbagh’s last moments on social networks, including local news photographs and witness video posted on YouTube by the state-owned Middle East News Agency.

Photographs and video recorded before the police moved in seemed to show the protesters, including Ms. Sabbagh, standing peacefully outside the Air France-KLM office in Talaat Harb Square, near Tahrir. As officers charged at the protesters, guns drawn, shots rang out and Ms. Sabbagh fell to the pavement.

The Cairene journalist who blogs as Zeinobia translated a firsthand account of the shooting posted on Facebook late Saturday by Osama Hamamm, a freelance photographer whose images of Ms. Sabbagh — crumpled on the pavement, alongside flowers, as the police charged in and protesters fled — stunned Egyptians.

According to Mr. Hamamm, the activists — from a party that had supported both the original uprising in 2011 and the protests that forced the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi from power in 2013 — were merely chanting the slogan “Bread, Freedom and Social Justice,” when the police arrived in the square.
