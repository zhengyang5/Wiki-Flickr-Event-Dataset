At least six people have been killed and up to 80 others injured after a string of bombings targeted the police and government buildings in Egypt.
The bombings came on a day street clashes across Egypt between Islamist supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsi and backers of the military killed 14 people.
Catherine Ashton, EU foreign policy chief, who had tried unsuccessfully to mediate between Morsi's supporters and the interim government in August, condemned the bombings.
Riot police pushed back hundreds of onlookers, some of whom chanted slogans against Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.
Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, claiming responsibility for Friday's bombings, said they were aimed to avenge the killings of Morsi's supporters.
