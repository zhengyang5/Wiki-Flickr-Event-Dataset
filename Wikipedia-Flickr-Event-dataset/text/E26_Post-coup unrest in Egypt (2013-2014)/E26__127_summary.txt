Egypt's health ministry announced in a statement on Friday evening that a 15-year-old boy, Ihab Ahmed Selim, was killed by a gunshot wound he sustained during the clashes.
Earlier on Friday, a protester was announced dead in Alexandria when clashes erupted between hundreds of supporters and opponents of Morsi, although his identity was still unknown.
The health ministry added that five were injured during the clashes in Alexandria and four others were injured in scuffles across Cairo on Friday.
Security forces then intervened firing tear gas to break up the crowd and arresting a number of Morsi's supporters.
Another 13-year-old boy was killed in Alexandria on Friday evening following the clashes, a security official confirmed to Ahram Online.
