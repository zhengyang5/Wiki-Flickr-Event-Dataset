Egypt’s interim president on Tuesday appointed a liberal economist and former finance minister as prime minister and former U.N. atomic watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei as vice president for foreign affairs.
The appointments were announced hours after Mr. Mansour issued a constitutional declaration that set a timetable for amending the Islamist-drafted constitution and for elections.
The Nour Party had sided with the military in last Wednesday’s ouster of Egypt’s first democratically elected president — Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The National Salvation Front, the largest opposition bloc, rejected the constitutional declaration.
Mr. Mansour, chief justice of the Constitutional Court, was sworn in as interim president last week.
