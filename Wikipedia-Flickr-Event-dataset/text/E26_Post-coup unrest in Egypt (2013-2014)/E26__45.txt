The Egyptian army has toppled President Mohamed Morsi, announcing a roadmap for the countryâ€™s political future that will be implemented by a national reconciliation committee.

The head of Egypt's armed forces issued a declaration on Wednesday evening suspending the constitution and appointing the head of the constitutional court as interim head of state.



Here are some reactions to the latest developments in Cairo:

Adal El-Bendary, public relations employee



"We ousted one dictator and now we've ousted a second one. We'll do it again if necessary, we are experienced now ... This will be in the minds of the army or any politician in the future - they will not want to face the same destiny as Morsi or Mubarak."

Haisam Haggag, an engineer



"This is not a coup. Look at the people on the streets. The people said this is a revolution."



Ashraf el-Sherif, political science professor at the American University of Cairo



"We cannot talk about constitutional correctness as we are on the threshold of a new corrected revolutionary roadmap. Egypt's future remains open: a democracy can happen, but so can an autocracy. The roadmap will bear many flaws and problems, but protesters have also learned many lessons."



Galal Murra, Nour party's secretary general



"We took this position (on agreeing to army political road map) and we took these decisions only so we stop the bloodshed of our people."
