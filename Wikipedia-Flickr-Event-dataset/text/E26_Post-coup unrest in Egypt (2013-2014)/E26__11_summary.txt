Thousands of supporters of deposed President Mohammed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood had staged the sit-ins.
Security forces fired tear gas canisters as helicopters circled above.
Egyptian television said that by evening the security forces had finally seized full control of the site, and were allowing surviving protesters to leave.
But several Muslim Brotherhood leaders were reportedly detained, including Essam El-Erian and Mohamed El-Beltagy, whose 17-year-old daughter was apparently killed.
Most of the dead are thought to be Morsi supporters, but members of the security forces were also killed.
