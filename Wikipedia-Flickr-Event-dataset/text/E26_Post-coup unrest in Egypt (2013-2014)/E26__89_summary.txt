"The act of mobilisation and counter-mobilisation foreshadows civil war," the Nour Party – a former ally of the Muslim Brotherhood which then supported the military's ouster of Morsi – said in a statement Wednesday evening.
If the state violates the law it would be destroying itself," the Nour Party's statement continued.
The 6 April Youth Movement made similar criticisms, announcing that El-Sisi's call would only worsen the current political crisis.
Clashes in the restive Sinai Peninsula between the army and Islamist militants have also left dozens dead since ousted president Morsi was removed from his post by the military on 3 July amid massive protests.
El-Sisi's call for rallies has garnered support from numerous political entities but has also raised raised concerns over potential spread of violence among some.
