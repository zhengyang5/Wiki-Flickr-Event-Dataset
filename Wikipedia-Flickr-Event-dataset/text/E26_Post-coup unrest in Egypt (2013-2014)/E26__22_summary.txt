The Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, has appointed a member of the hardline Islamist group Gamaa Islamiya to the governorship of Luxor â€“ a tourist city in which militants associated with the group killed 58 tourists in 1997.
The symbolism of the appointment has enraged Egypt's sidelined non-Islamist opposition, who see it as further evidence that Morsi is unconcerned about the country's increasing polarisation.
Tourism is the lifeblood of Luxor, home to some of Egypt's most dramatic ancient temples and pharaonic tombs, including that of Tutankhamun.
The city has been hit hard by the downtown in foreign visitors during the past two years of turmoil.
Adel el-Khayat, Luxor's new governor, is not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the group Morsi once helped lead.
