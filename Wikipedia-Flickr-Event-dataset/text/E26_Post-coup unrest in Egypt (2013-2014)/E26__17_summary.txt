Mr Mursi, whose Muslim Brotherhood won most seats, said the chamber should reconvene until a new election is held.
The military had enforced a court order last month dissolving parliament because party members had contested seats reserved for independents.

The president and the Muslim Brotherhood have never accepted the decision by the military to dissolve parliament.
