Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed al-Beltagy said his daughter was killed on Wednesday in clashes between protesters and security forces as they attempted to disperse the sit-in at Rabea al-Adaweya.
Muslim Brotherhood sources claim that the death toll is over 2000, according to the Rabea field hospital.
Yasser Mehrez, spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood denied reports that Beltagy, among other Brotherhood leaders had been arrested, according to the Freedom and Justice Partyâ€™s online portal.
Mada reporters counted five dead bodies inside one of the several fridges in the makeshift morgue inside the mosque at Rabea al-Adaweya.
Ahmed said security forces started by firing tear gas, after which they proceeded to use live ammunition.
