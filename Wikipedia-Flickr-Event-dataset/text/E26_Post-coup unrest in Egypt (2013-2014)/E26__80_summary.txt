In the first high-level visit by a U.S. official to Egypt since the ouster of former president Mohammad Mursi, Burns said top Muslim Brotherhood leader should be released for a national reconciliation dialogue to start.
“If representatives of some of the largest parties in Egypt are detained or excluded, how are dialogue and participation possible?” Burns asked.
He also urged those opposed to Mursi’s ouster to participate in the political process peacefully, Reuters reported.
Anti-Mursi protesters accuse the United States of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and criticize U.S. media, mainly the CNN, and other U.S. lawmakers for describing the Mursi’s ouster as a coup.
“I don’t think that Egypt is in danger of repeating the tragedy that we see in Syria today,” he said.
