The Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party had viewed the ruling military council as an avenue to elections the party believes it can win.
At least 10 people have been killed and more than 400 wounded in a brutal crackdown on protesters that began Friday.
Party member Mohamed Beltagy in his statement called the military council a “collaborator with those disrupting Egypt’s security and safety.
“[The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces] tries to create new crises as the time for power transfer to an elected civilian government gets closer.”The hashtag #NoScaf, for the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, was being used on the English-language Twitter feed for the Brotherhood.
The military council posted a video on its Facebook page of young men throwing rocks at the parliament building and in one case trying to set fire to the building.
