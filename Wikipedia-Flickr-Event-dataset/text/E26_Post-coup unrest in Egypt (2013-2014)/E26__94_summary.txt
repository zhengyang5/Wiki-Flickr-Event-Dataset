The protests in Cairo remained largely peaceful, but at least five people were killed in clashes in the northern city of Alexandria, according to the interior ministry.
'The dictatorial police state'Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and its remaining political allies had been planning their own mass rallies for more than a week.
The pro-army rallies were intended to overwhelm the pro-Morsi crowd's numbers and demonstrate public support for the army.
"It is either victory over the coup or martyrdom," said Mohamed el-Beltagy, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood, in a speech to the crowds.
Pro- and anti-military protesters clashed in Alexandria, outside the Qaid Ibrahim mosque, often a flashpoint for demonstrations.
