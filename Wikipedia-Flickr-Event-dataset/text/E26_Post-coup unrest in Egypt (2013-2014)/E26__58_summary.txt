A deadly shooting at the site of a sit-in by Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Cairo, demanding the reinstatement of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, has left dozens of people dead.
Also on Monday, Egypt closed down the Cairo headquarters of the Brotherhood, saying weapons were found inside it.
Regardless, it will serve to validate the fears of many of Morsi's supporters, who claim they were attacked first.
The Salafist Nour Party announced it was suspending its participation from talks over new government in protest against Monday's fatal shootings.
She said others from Al Nour had been seen on local media channels saying they approve of Bahaa el-Din.
