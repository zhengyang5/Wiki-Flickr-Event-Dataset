Egypt's military commander-in-chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi on Wednesday unveiled a "roadmap" for Egypt's political future proposed by the opposition, which included the ouster of President Mohamed Morsi to make way for snap presidential elections.
The roadmap will include the following points:-The temporary suspension of the current constitution.
-Empowering the head of Egypt's High Constitutional Court (HCC) to run the country until a new president is elected via early presidential polls.
He further explained that the armed forces had continuously attempted to resolve disputes between the presidency and opposition, starting in November 2012 following the issuing of Morsi's controversial constitutional declaration.
Since the passing of the Egyptian Constitution last December, the opposition has demanded that the constitution be amended because Islamists dominated the constituent assembly that drafted the constitution.
