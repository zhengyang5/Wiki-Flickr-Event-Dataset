Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has called for mass protests again in a campaign to reverse the army's overthrow of the elected Islamist president, but it also gave a first sign of willingness to negotiate with its opponents.
However, a Brotherhood official also said on Thursday, a day after a Muslim Brotherhood delegation met top EU envoy Catherine Ashton, that the movement had proposed a framework for talks mediated by the EU.
Signalling for the first time a formal readiness for negotiations, Haddad said the Brotherhood had proposed through an EU envoy a framework for talks to resolve Egypt's crisis.
The EU envoy, Bernardino Leon, said the two sides remained far apart.
The military has denied orchestrating a coup, saying it intervened to prevent chaos following protests on June 30 against Morsi's much-criticised, year-long rule.
