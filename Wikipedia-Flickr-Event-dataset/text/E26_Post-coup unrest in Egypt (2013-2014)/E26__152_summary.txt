A friend, crouching down, grabs Ms. Sabbagh around the waist as she stands upright with blood running down her face.
So the police killings, including Ms. Sabbagh’s, had sent a clear message.
A spokesman for the Egyptian Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Hany Abdel Latif, raised the same question, saying the police could not have killed Ms. Sabbagh.
“They were youth, and they shot fireworks at the police, as well as cut off a public road,” Mr. Abdel Latif said.
Any group that tries to do anything is faced with very violent confrontation without warning.”So the mourners canceled the protests, Mr. Abdelnaem said.
