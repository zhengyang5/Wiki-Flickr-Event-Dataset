The violence came as Morsy's supporters held massive protests across the country, calling for his reinstatement, a counter to huge demonstrations among those celebrating his ouster.
The fighting broke out when Morsy supporters tried to storm the building, Nile TV said.
CNN's Reza Sayah, reporting from outside the building, said he had seen one body around which scores of Morsy supporters were huddled, some of them crying.
Some demonstrators waved flags and held pictures of Morsy and vowed not to leave until the military returns Morsy to office.
The violence was the latest fallout following Wednesday's move by the nation's powerful military to remove Morsy.
