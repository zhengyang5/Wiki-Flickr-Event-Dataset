Egypt's Shura Council was dissolved by Wednesday's military statement that also deposed President Mohamed Morsi, a judicial source has told Al-Ahram Arabic news website.
In early June, the law that regulated the council's elections was ruled unconstitutional by the High Consitutional Court (HCC).
The council had held legislative powers since the lower house was dissolved by a separate court ruling.
Egyptian army chief Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi announced the ouster of Mohamed Morsi on Wednesday and said HCC chief Adly Mansour would become interim president until fresh elections are held.
Mansour was appointed HCC head in May.
