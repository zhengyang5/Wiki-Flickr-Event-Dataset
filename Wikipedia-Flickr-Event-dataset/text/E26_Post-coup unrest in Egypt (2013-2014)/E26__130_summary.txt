A student was killed in clashes at Cairo University between protesters and security forces on Thursday afternoon, spokesman of the coroner's office Hesham Abdel-Hamid and head of the Ambulance authority Ahmed El-Ansari told AFP.
Angry students attempted to block the subway line at the station adjacent to the university, but were dispersed by security forces, Al-Ahram reported.
The interior minister said in a statement issued on Thursday evening that students at Cairo University had marched outside the campus "blocking traffic" and "hurling stones at security forces based outside campus."
The government says a protest law is essential in dealing with the recent unrest.
Last week, the cabinet issued a decision allowing security forces to enter university campuses without requiring permission from the university heads or the general prosecution, as was previously mandated.
