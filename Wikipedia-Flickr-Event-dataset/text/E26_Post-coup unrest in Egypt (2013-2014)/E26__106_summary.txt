Members of Fatah's Revolutionary Council have hit back at political rivals Hamas, claiming documents aired by the movement are "fabricated and falsified".
Salah al-Bardaweel, a Hamas member speaking at the conference, said the documents "urge hatred, not only against Gaza or Hamas, but against the Palestinian people".
And they need to be used as evidence to implicate Hamas in the recent acts of violence in Egypt."
Producing two documents to the camera, Matar showed differing letterheads, highlighting the "real" one against the one revealed by Hamas.
Egypt's military has also blamed members of Hamas of involvement in stoking tensions in the Sinai peninsula.
