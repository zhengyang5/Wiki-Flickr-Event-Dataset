By the end of Sunday, officials had assessed 82 corpses, as the death toll from Saturday's police massacre of pro-Morsi supporters kept rising.
State officials said Saturday's deaths took place after pro-Morsi protesters fired first â€“ and even claimed that police only used teargas to disperse them.
"We didn't have enough places in the fridges to fit all the bodies," said Dr Hazem Hossam, an official at Zeinhom.
Tens of thousands of pro-Morsi supporters have camped outside the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque since late June, when Morsi's overthrow began to seem likely.
"He was just a man searching for a job, trying to earn enough to get married," said Taher of Fahmy.
