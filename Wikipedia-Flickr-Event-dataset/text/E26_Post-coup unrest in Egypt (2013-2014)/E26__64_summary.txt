Egyptian authorities began requiring Syrians to get visas before arriving in the country, according to officials and opposition figures, many of whom live in the Egyptian capital.
"This Egyptian decision is a reward to Bashar Assad for all the Syrians he has killed," Maleh said from the Egyptian capital Monday night.
I have an apartment and I have a bank account in Egypt," he said earlier from the Cairo airport.
In response, the Syrian National Coalition said it regretted any crimes committed by Syrian nationals in Egypt and said Syrians "must not be punished for individual criminal acts."
The organization is a weaker version of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood but is still considered the most politically organized Syrian opposition group.
