Clashes between supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, local residents and security forces Friday left at least five dead.
Friday protests — known for being the largest of the week, and often followed by violent clashes — this week came only two days after the interim government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group.
Wednesday's decision to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group came after the deadly bombing of Tuesday in the Delta city of Mansoura, killing 16 near Mansoura's Security Directorate.
The government blames the Muslim Brotherhood for orchestrating attacks on its buildings and security personnel since the ouster of Morsi 3 July.
The Muslim Brotherhood vehemently denied involvement in attacks on government buildings and security personnel.
