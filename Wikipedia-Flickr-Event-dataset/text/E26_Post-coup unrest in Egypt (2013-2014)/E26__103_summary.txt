CAIRO (Reuters) - The United States urged Arab ally Egypt to pull “back from the brink” after security forces killed dozens of supporters of deposed Islamist President Mohamed Mursi and opened a dangerous new phase in the army’s confrontation with his Muslim Brotherhood.
Washington, treading a fine line with an important Middle East ally and recipient of over $1 billion in military aid, urged the Egyptian security forces to respect the right to peaceful protest.
Fireworks are set off near police and anti-Mursi protesters by supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi during clashes in Nasr city area, east of Cairo July 27, 2013.
Brotherhood activists said they would not be cowed and warned of worse bloodshed if the security forces did not back down.
On July 8, more than 50 Brotherhood supporters died when security forces opened fire on them outside a Cairo barracks.
