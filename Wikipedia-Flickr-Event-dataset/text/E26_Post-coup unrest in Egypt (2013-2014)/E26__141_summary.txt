A 12-year-old boy was killed in Minya governorate in Upper Egypt during clashes between Pro-Morsi protesters and security forces Friday afternoon.
According to security sources, the boy was shot dead by birdshot rounds while he was watching the clashes from his balcony in the city of Samalut, Minya.
According to the security sources, clashes erupted between protesters and locals when Morsi supporters attempted to organize a rally after Friday prayers.
