Protesters said shooting started as they performed morning prayers outside the Cairo barracks where Mursi is believed to be held.
The White House said aid was not about to halt aid to Egypt.
Al Jazeeraâ€™s Egypt channel showed footage from inside a makeshift clinic near the scene of the violence, where Mursi supporters attempted to treat bloodied men.
Film broadcast by Egyptian state TV showed Mursi supporters throwing rocks at soldiers in riot gear on one of the main roads leading to Cairo airport.
But White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the United States would not immediately cut off aid to Egypt.
