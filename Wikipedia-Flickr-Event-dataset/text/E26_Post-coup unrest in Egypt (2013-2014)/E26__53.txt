A deputy leader of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, former presidential candidate Khairat El-Shater, has been arrested, security sources, his party and state news agency MENA said on July 5.Security sources said al-Shater, a wealthy businessman seen as the movement's main political strategist, was taken into custody on suspicion of incitement to violence. He was arrested at his apartment in Cairo.Among the Brotherhood's best known public figures, Shater was the latest of several of its leaders to be taken in since elected President Mohamed Morsi was overthrown by the army on July 3.Morsi was propelled into the presidential campaign last year when Shater was disqualified on the grounds of a past criminal conviction.
