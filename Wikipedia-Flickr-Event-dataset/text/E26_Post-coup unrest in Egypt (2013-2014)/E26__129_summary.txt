According to an official from the health ministry, another was killed in clashes in Upper Egypt's Minya, reported state-run news agency MENA.
The Friday protests marked 100 days since the dispersal of two Cairo protest camps demanding the reinstatement of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.
Security forces were able to separate the clashing parties in Alexandria, Al-Ahram reported, where such Friday confrontations have become a common occurrence.
Following the arrest of hundreds of top and mid-ranking Muslim Brotherhood members, the frequency and magnitude of pro-Morsi protests has been effectively reduced.
Security forces violently dispersed the Muslim Brotherhood's main sit-ins at Rabaa Al-Adawiya mosque and Nahda Square in August, killing hundreds in the process.
