Egypt's public prosecutor has issued a temporary freeze on the assets of senior Muslim Brotherhood leaders as well as senior leaders of pro-Morsi parties and groups, Egyptian state television has reported.
The freeze will affect Mohamed Badie, the general guide of the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as Khairat al-Shater, Mohamed Ezat, Mahi Ekef, Saed ElKatatni, Essam ElErian, Mohamed ElBeltagy - all members of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group.
ElBaradei, who led the country's main opposition group in criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood, was sworn-in the same day as the country's interim vice president.
"I believe Morsi initially succeeded in calming the situation on the war front between Israel and Gaza," he told Al Jazeera.
Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have rejected offers to become a part of the new cabinet, vowing to continue defying what they say is a military coup.
