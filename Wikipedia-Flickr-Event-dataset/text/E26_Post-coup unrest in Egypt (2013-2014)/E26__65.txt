Here's a summary of the main events today:

•Egypt was braced for more mass protests in the wake of the killing of 51 supporters of the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi, as political leaders bargained over the creation of a civilian transitional government to rule with military support, until new elections are held next year. Pro-Morsi crowds were still gathering in Cairo near the scene of Monday's killings, described as a massacre by Muslim Brotherhood supporters but defended by the army as a response to a "terrorist" attack.

• The authorities are refusing to release the bodies of those killed until families accept official autopsy reports amid a mounting dispute about the circumstances of their deaths. The Egyptian health ministry said no women and children were among the dead as the Muslim Brotherhood alleged.

• UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has backed calls for an independent inquiry into the killings. A statement released by his office said: “The Secretary-General condemns these killings and calls for them to be thoroughly investigated by independent and competent national bodies, and those responsible need to be brought to justice."

• The Egyptian army insisted it did not use excessive force against pro-Morsi supporters amid calls for an independent investigation into the alleged massacre. Speaking to AP, spokesman Colonel Ahmed Mohammed Ali, said: "What excessive force? We were dealing with people shooting at us with live ammunition. It would have been excessive if we killed 300." Amnesty called for an inquiry and an end to the practice of white-washing abuses by the Egyptian army.

• Samir Radwan, favourite to become prime minister, told the Guardian that his priorities, if appointed, would be tackling the economy and "national reconciliation" – vital in an atmosphere of extreme polarisation. Radwan said if chosen his priorities would be the economy and healing the deep divisions in Egyptian society.

• The removal of the Muslim Brotherhood appears to have opened the way to lucrative financial backing from the Gulf. The United Arab Emirates has agreed to grant Egypt $1bn and lend it another $2bn, according to Reuters. Its sources also said Saudi Arabia may lend Egypt another $2bn.
