VideoHuge protests calling for the resignation of Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi and early presidential elections are taking place in the capital, Cairo, and other cities.
Tens of thousands of opponents have massed in Tahrir Square and outside the main presidential palace.
Protesters accuse Mr Morsi of failing to tackle economic and security problems since taking power a year ago.
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Tahrir Square says the size of the protest has been wholly unexpected.
