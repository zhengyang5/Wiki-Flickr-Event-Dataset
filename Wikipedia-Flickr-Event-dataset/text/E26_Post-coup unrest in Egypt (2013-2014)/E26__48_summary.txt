The National Salvation Front (NSF) issued a statement early Thursday on the dramatic developments in Egypt congratulating the Egyptian people on their insistence to hold firm to the goals of the January 25 Revolution.
The statement also insisted that what has happened in Egypt is not a coup but rather a necessary intervention.
"We would like to confirm that what Egypt is witnessing now is not a military coup by any standards.
The NSF underlined that no political forces or parties should be excluded in the coming phase in Egypt.
"We confirm our strong belief in the right of all political groups to express their opinions freely, and to form their own political parties.
