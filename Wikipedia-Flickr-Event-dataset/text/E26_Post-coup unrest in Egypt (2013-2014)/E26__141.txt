A 12-year-old boy was killed in Minya governorate in Upper Egypt during clashes between Pro-Morsi protesters and security forces Friday afternoon.



According to security sources, the boy was shot dead by birdshot rounds while he was watching the clashes from his balcony in the city of Samalut, Minya.



Aswat Masrya news website also reported that at least one person was killed in clashes in Tabl village in the Nile Delta city of Damietta. According to the security sources, clashes erupted between protesters and locals when Morsi supporters attempted to organize a rally after Friday prayers.



Pro-Morsi demonstrators in Damietta were calling for the release of five detainees who were recently arrested in Tabl village during another protest.

Security forces in Samalut arrested 3 Pro-Morsi protesters who were allegedly in possession of bird shotguns and live ammunition.

There were also clashes in Cairo between security forces and Morsi supporters, a couple of blocks away from Rabaa Square, where hundreds of Islamists were killed when Egypt's interim authorities crushed a sit-in on 14 August 2013.



Based on eye witness accounts, the protesters hurled rocks at security forces and blocked the streets with torched tires. Police forces dispersed the demonstrations with tear gas.



Security forces also tightened security at the Giza directorate and blocked traffic from its location on Mourad Street.

A security source told Al-Ahram Arabic that the decision to tighten the security at the Giza directorate was made after the bombing of the Giza Bridge last Friday which targeted Central Security Forces' vehicles.



The National Alliance to Support Legitimacy called on supporters last Thursday to renew protests for the duration of a week in observance of 6 months which have passed since the dispersal of sit-ins at Rabaa Adawiya and El Nahda squares last August.

The sit-ins were dispersed by force and claimed the lives of hundreds.
