A Hamas official says elements within the interim Egyptian government colluded with their opponents to demonise them.

Salah, al-Bardaweel, a member of Hamas, said during a press conference on Tuesday that political rivals Fatah, as well as members of the Palestinian Authority, the governing body in the occupied West Bank, pushed forward a malicious agenda to tarnish Hamas.

He also denied any involvement with the current unrest in Egypt.



'Damning evidence'

"I'm going to tell you about documents and damning evidence, pointing to interference in the Palestinian issue, and into relations between Palestine and Egypt," he said.

"These documents urge hatred, not only against Gaza or Hamas, but against the Palestinian people."

Abdullah Abdullah, a member of Fatah based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, told Al Jazeera that "it is unfortunate that Hamas sinks to that level, and forges documents".

"Fatah is in defence of every Palestinian, including Hamas numbers, so its really a pity that Hamas sinks to that level. In a case where they find themselves exposed, they try to put the blame on somebody else."

Since the ouster of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi on 3rd July through a popular military coup, the interim government and Egyptian media holds Hamas responsible for a prison break during the January 2011 revolution, also accusing the deposed president of spying for the group.

Egypt's military has also blamed members of Hamas of involvement in stoking tensions in the Sinai peninsula.

Morsi is detained pending investigations, including spying for Hamas to attack police institutions and break into Egyptian prisons during the revolution, as well assisting Hamas in kidnapping officers and soldiers.
