Clashes between protesters and security forces in Alexandria on Friday left one 17-year-old girl killed and at least two others injured, the Ministry of Health said.
Students Against the Coup (SAC), a student initiative that opposes Egypt’s current regime, stated that security forces killed the girl, Sondos Abu Bakr, as they were dispersing the protest.
Meanwhile, SAC also reported that security forces dispersed a protest in Giza’s Faisal neighbourhood on Friday.
Earlier this month, security forces killed two students on separate occasions in protests outside Cairo.
Over the past year, a number of international and local human rights organisations criticised the current state of human rights in Egypt as state security forces have killed and detained hundreds of citizens.
