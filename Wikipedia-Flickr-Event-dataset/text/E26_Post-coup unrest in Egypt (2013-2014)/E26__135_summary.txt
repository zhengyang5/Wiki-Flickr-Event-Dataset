The terrorist attack began when a car bomb ripped through a police building in central Cairo, killing four and injuring 76 others, according to the health ministry.
In a third blast, a small bomb went off later on Friday morning at a police station in Talbiya district, also in Giza, near the pyramids.
The first explosion, which hit the Cairo Security Directorate in Bab El-Khalk district, blew out the windows of the building and stripped off parts of its fa√ßade.
Initial investigations showed a remotely-detonated car bomb was behind the blast, a security official told Ahram .
A bomb also exploded outside a Cairo court just before polls were to set to open in last week's constitutional referendum, leaving no casualties.
