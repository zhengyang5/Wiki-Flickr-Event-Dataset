El-Beblawi met with several candidates for ministerial positions on Monday having met with other candidates the previous day.
Nader Bakkar, spokesperson for Al-Nour Party confirmed that his party would not participate in the interim government because it believes that the cabinet should not include representatives from political parties.
Bakkar said El-Beblawi is an exception because he met the criteria that the Al-Nour Party had put forward for the role of prime minister.
Bakkar explained that Al-Nour wanted the prime minister to have previous experience in government and to be specialised in economic affairs.
El-Beblawi has previously served as minister of finance and deputy prime minister for economic affairs.
