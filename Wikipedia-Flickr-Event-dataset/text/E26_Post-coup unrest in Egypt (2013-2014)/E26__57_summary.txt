Thousands are protesting in Egypt after both the Muslim Brotherhood and their opponents called for new mass rallies Sunday, renewing fears of another round of street violence after the countryâ€™s military removed Islamist President Mohammed Morsi from office.
In Friday's violence it sided with the anti-Morsi crowds and in one case, opened fire on pro-Morsi demonstrators.
At the Rabaa Adawiya mosque in Cairo, an estimated 20,000 pro-Morsi supporters have gathered, chanting and waving posters, The Guardian reports.
The al-Nour Party is one of the few Islamist groups openly cooperating with the new leadership.
When the June 30 wave of anti-Morsi protests began, the party called on its followers to stay neutral.
