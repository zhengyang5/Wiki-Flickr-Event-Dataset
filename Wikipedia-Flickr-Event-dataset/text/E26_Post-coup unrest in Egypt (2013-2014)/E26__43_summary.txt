For the second time in 2½ years of political upheaval, the powerful army appears to be positioned to remove the country's leader.

"Leave, leave," they chanted to Morsi, electrified as they waited to hear of an army move.
They also surrounded rallies being held by Morsi's supporters — an apparent move to keep them contained if a final move on the president is made.
They handed them flags, took pictures with them and chanted, "The army and people are one hand."
