Four people were killed at pro-Mohamed Morsi protests across Egypt on Friday.
One person was killed in downtown Alexandria during clashes between Morsi supporters and local residents, a senior police official told Al-Ahram's Arabic news website.
Head of investigative police in the coastal city, General Nasser El-Abd, said the death occurred "when Brotherhood protesters fired at local residents," and another person had received gunshot injuries.
In Giza, security forces fired teargas at pro-Morsi protesters in Khatem Al-Morsaleem Street in the El-Omraneya district.
Morsi supporters have been holding almost daily protests since his ouster in July.
