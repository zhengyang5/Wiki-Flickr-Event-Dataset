Pro-Morsi crowds were still gathering in Cairo near the scene of Monday's killings, described as a massacre by Muslim Brotherhood supporters but defended by the army as a response to a "terrorist" attack.
The Egyptian health ministry said no women and children were among the dead as the Muslim Brotherhood alleged.
• The Egyptian army insisted it did not use excessive force against pro-Morsi supporters amid calls for an independent investigation into the alleged massacre.
Amnesty called for an inquiry and an end to the practice of white-washing abuses by the Egyptian army.
• The removal of the Muslim Brotherhood appears to have opened the way to lucrative financial backing from the Gulf.
