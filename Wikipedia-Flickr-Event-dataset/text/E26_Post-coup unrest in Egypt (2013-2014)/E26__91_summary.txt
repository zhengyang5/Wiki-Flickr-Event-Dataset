The 6 April Youth Movement released a statement on Thursday announcing they were not participating in Friday “anti-terrorism” protests.
Minister of Defence Abdul Fatah Al-Sisi had called on Egyptians to take to the streets on Friday to delegate him to confront “violence and terrorism”.
“The US occupied Afghanistan and Iraq under the claim of fighting terrorism and Bashar killed his people under the same claim,” the statement read.
6 April said the word “delegation” may entail extraordinary or unknown measures that the army didn’t announce anything about.
They added that they will not take part in a semi-official call from the state to take to the streets in “a protest called for by the army and supported by media, we protest only when we see it necessary.”
