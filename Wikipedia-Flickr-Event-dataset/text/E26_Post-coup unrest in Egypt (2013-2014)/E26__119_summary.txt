CAIRO â€” Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood said Saturday that a son of its spiritual leader was killed during fierce clashes in downtown Cairo, as hundreds of Islamists supporters of the country's ousted president remained barricaded inside a mosque.
The group's political arm, the Freedom and Justice party, said on its official website that Mohammed Badie's son Ammar was killed Friday.
The death toll in Friday's clashes rose Saturday to 173 people killed nationwide, said Shereef Shawki, a spokesman for Egypt's Cabinet.
The upper floors of a commercial building towering over Ramses Square caught fire during the mayhem, with flames engulfing it for hours.
Army tanks and soldiers closed off main entrances of Ramses Square as soldiers sealed off the place with barbed wire.
