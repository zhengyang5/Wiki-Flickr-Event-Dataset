The United States has criticised the recent violence in Egypt, where 72 people were killed in an attack on a rally in favour of ousted president Mohamed Morsi.
"The United States strongly condemns the bloodshed and violence" in Cairo and Alexandria, the White House said in a statement on Monday, urging the military-backed interim government to respect the rights of demonstrators.
Egypt has been violently polarised since the July 3 overthrow of Morsi, the country's first democratically elected president, in a military coup triggered by massive demonstrations against his year-long rule.
The military issued its own warning to Cairo protesters in flyers dropped from helicopters early on Monday.
State news agency MENA said they were being investigated on suspicion of inciting violence and murder.
