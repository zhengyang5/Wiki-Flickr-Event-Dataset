An Egyptian appeals court has sentenced a female human rights activist and lawyer to 15 months behind bars for assaulting police officers in 2013, a court official says.
The Sunday ruling was issued by the Egyptian Appeals Court in the coastal city of Alexandria after a lower court sentenced Mahienour el-Massry, the 29-year-old activist, to two years in prison.
The court also sentenced journalist Youssef Shabhan and poet Loay al-Qhwagy to 15 months in prison each in the same case, the Egyptian daily al-Ahram reported.
Since then, Sisi has been cracking down on opposition by banning the Muslim Brotherhood movement and arresting thousands of its members and supporters.
Nearly the entire leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood and thousands of its members and supporters are currently in Egypt prisons.
