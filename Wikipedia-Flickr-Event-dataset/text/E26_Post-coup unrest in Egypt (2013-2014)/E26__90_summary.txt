Former presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh talks during an interview with Reuters, Cairo (Stringer Egypt Reuters, / )CAIRO (Reuters) - The Egyptian army's call for rallies on Friday risks triggering violence, the party led by former Islamist Presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh said on Wednesday, urging the military to row back for the sake of peace.
Supporters of deposed Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, already camped out in a Cairo suburb in protest at his removal, have also called for protests for Friday.
Sisi earlier on Wednesday urged Egyptians to rally on Friday to give the army a mandate to act against what he described as violence and terrorism.
"The idea of drawing the masses into the picture removes (the army) from the neutrality by which it promised to abide," Abol Fotouh's party said.
Abol Fotouh quit the Muslim Brotherhood in 2011 to mount an independent bid for the presidency and has distanced himself from the Islamist movement since then.
