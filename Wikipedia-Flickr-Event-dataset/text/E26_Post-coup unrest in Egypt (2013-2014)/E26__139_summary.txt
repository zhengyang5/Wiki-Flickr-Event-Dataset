The death toll from clashes in Egypt on Saturday's anniversary of the 2011 uprising has risen to 64, Egypt's forensic authorities' spokesperson told Ahram Online.
The toll on 25 January only includes those in Cairo and Giza, spokesman Hisham Abdel Hamid said.
Post-mortem examinations showed at least 58 of the deaths were caused by gunshot wounds and one by birdshot, Abdel Hamid added.
In east Cairo's Mattariya district alone, 26 were killed when police violently dispersed a demonstration by Morsi supporters.
On Friday, a string of bombings targeting police in Cairo and the neighbouring Giza governorate killed six people and injured dozens.
