Supporters of Egypt's deposed president Mohamed Morsi plan to march in the capital, Cairo, and reiterated that they are committed to peaceful struggle one day after hundreds of their supporters were killed in a bloody crackdown.
We remain strong, defiant and resolved," Brotherhood spokesman Gehad el-Haddad wrote on his Twitter feed.
But Morsi's supporters have not all remained peaceful.
Protests erupted nationwide after the Cairo crackdown, some of them violent.
The military-installed government has declared a month-long state of emergency and imposed the dusk-to-dawn curfew on Cairo and 10 other provinces.
