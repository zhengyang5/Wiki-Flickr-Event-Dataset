Meanwhile on Sinai, a suicide car bomber attacked the security headquarters in the southern city of El-Tor.
Near-daily attacks on the peninsula have escalated in the three months since the Egyptian army ousted President Mohamed Morsi.
Morsi's supporters organised their own counter-protest, hoping they could occupy Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square, which was heavily guarded by security forces.
Most of the victims were Morsi supporters, who vowed in a statement on Monday to continue their protests, "fuelled by the precious blood and souls of the noble martyrs."
Thousands of Morsi supporters have been killed, and more than 2,000 imprisoned, in the three months since his ouster.
