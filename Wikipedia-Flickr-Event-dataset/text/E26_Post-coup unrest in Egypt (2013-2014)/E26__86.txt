Egyptian presidential media adviser Ahmed El-Muslimany stated on Wednesday that the presidency is urging citizens to take the streets on Friday to support calls for combating terrorism.

"Egypt has already started war on terrorism, El-sisi's calls is in protection of the revolution and the state," said presidential media adviser Ahmed El-Muslimany in an earlier statement.

Earlier on Wednesday, army chief Abdel Fattah El-Sisi called for mass demonstrations on Friday to give the military a mandate to crackdown on "violence and terrorism."

More than 100 people have been killed in violent clashes since Morsiâ€™s removal on 3 June, pitting his supporters against his opponents and security forces.

Marches from both sides have been repeatedly attacked by armed men. The use of live rounds has been common in recent weeks amid an increase in violent protests across the country.
