Egypt's health ministry said Saturday that one was killed and 35 injured in Friday clashes between pro-Muslim Brotherhood protesters and the police.

The death occured in Cairo while the 35 injured were from clashes in both Cairo and Egyptâ€™s northern governorate of Gharbiya.

Clashes took place mainly in north-eastern Cairo's Matariya district, were anti-government protesters marched near Tawfik Mosque, chanting against the armed forces and holding signs evoking Rabaa Al-Adawiya, the site of a deadly crackdown on Morsi supporters by security forces last summer.

According to Al-Ahram Arabic website, locals fired weapons at the march to disperse the protesters after the chants grew increasingly offensive to the army.

The pro-Brotherhood supporters reportedly responded to the gunfire by throwing Molotov cocktails at nearby houses, setting a number of them on fire.

Locals then physically attacked the protesters, dispersing the march. Fire engines arrived at the scene and extinguished the fires.

Al-Mataryia metro station was subsequently shut down as clashes erupted between police and pro-Morsi protesters.

Abdullah Fawzy, head of metro operations, told Al-Ahram Arabic news website Friday that the closure came after trees in front of the metro station caught fire.

In nearby Ain Shams, police faced off with around 300 Morsi supporters Friday as the latter attempted to block 6 October Street. Shops were closed and locals intervened to disperse the demonstration, reported Al-Ahram.

In the Haram area in Giza, police restored order in the Talbiya area after dozens of Morsi supporters blocked roads by setting car tires ablaze.

Friday's protests were called for by the pro-Morsi National Alliance to Support Legitimacy.

Police also dispersed other pro-Morsi protests in Cairo's Nasr City and Masr Al-Qadima.
