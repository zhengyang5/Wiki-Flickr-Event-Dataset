08:58, 17 August 2013 SaturdayNSF spokesman quits over Rabaa, Nahda massacresWorld Bulletin/News DeskThe spokesperson for Egypt's liberal National Salvation Front (NSF) resigned his post on Friday after the NSF condoned the killing two days earlier of hundreds of supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsi.
"The NSF has refused to condemn the massacre perpetrated by security forces when dispersing sit-ins in Rabaa al-Adawiya and Nahda Squares," Khaled Dawoud said in his resignation, which was posted on his Facebook page.
The NSF, which includes parties and groups from across the secular political spectrum, was established last November.
Dawoud also voiced disapproval of the criticisms leveled by some NSF figures at ElBaradei's resignation from the military-backed government in protest against Wednesday's crackdown.
Earlier this week, Darrag himself resigned from the Constitution Party to protest ElBaradei's resignation from the government.
