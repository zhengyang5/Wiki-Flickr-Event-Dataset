There have been two counts of the vote after the Greens and Australian Sports Party appealed the close first result.
The first count, saw Palmer United Party candidate Zhenya "Dio" Wang and Labor's Louise Pratt elected in the fifth and sixth spots.
But after the second count - declared on November 4 - the Sports Party's Wayne Dropulich and the Greens' Scott Ludlam edged out Mr Wang and Senator Pratt.
In the second, which did not include data from the missing votes , the order was reversed, with the Australian Christians ahead of the Shooters and Fishers by 12.
A ‘‘notional’’ recount conducted by the AEC, combining what is known about the missing votes with the second count, put the Shooters and Fishers back in front by one - unofficially reversing the final result in favour of Senator Pratt and Mr Wang.
