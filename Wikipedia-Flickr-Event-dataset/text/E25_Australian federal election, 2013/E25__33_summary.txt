Queensland Liberal National Party (LNP) bosses believe Peter Slipper had long planned to betray them, saying he intended to sabotage LNP colleagues during the coming state election.
The LNP state executive met to consider a litany of complaints against the Fisher MP, who resigned from the party on Thursday and accepted the role of speaker of the lower house of federal parliament.
Mr Slipper faced losing preselection for his Sunshine Coast seat from a challenge from former Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough and was unpopular among party members in the area.
The state executive convened on Wednesday to discuss whether disciplinary action was required after Mr Slipper snubbed former prime minister John Howard to attend a local function with Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd.
It reserved its decision, but after Thursday's dramatic events, state director Michael O'Dwyer issued a strongly worded statement.
