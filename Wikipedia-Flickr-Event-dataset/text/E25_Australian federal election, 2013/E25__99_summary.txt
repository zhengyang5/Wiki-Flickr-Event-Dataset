WikiLeaks founder brushes off election loss, saying he will try again for a Senate positionJulian Assange says his WikiLeaks party will live on despite its poor showing in the Australian election.
With about two-thirds of Senate first preferences counted, the party picked up 0.62% of the national vote.
Its best showing was in Victoria, where Assange was the lead candidate for the Senate and where it garnered 1.18% of the primary vote.
Asked if he would try again for a Senate seat in three or six years' time, Assange said: "I think so.
The WikiLeaks Party will continue for sure," he said.
