Court hears submissions to void WA Senate election after votes lost

Updated

The Court of Disputed Returns has wrapped up its first day of hearings into the lost votes from the West Australian Senate election last year.

A total of 1,370 ballot papers were discovered to have been lost when a re-count was requested by the Greens and the Australian Sports Party.

In the first count, which included the votes, Labor and the Palmer United Party secured the fifth and sixth positions on the state Senate ticket.

On the re-count, preferences led to the election of Greens Senator Scott Ludlam and the Sports Party's Wayne Dropulich.

The Australian Electoral Commission and the Greens have argued the result of the Senate vote cannot be determined "justly" without the missing ballot papers.

The Commission petitioned the Court of Disputed Returns when it could not find the votes, asking for the poll to be declared void.

It is arguing its case before Justice Kenneth Hayne in Melbourne.

The court is considering issues including whether those whose ballot papers were lost were prevented from voting, rendering the poll illegal.

A political analyst William Bowe says there are many reasons why the court might not order a re-election, including that the available ballots could be considered alongside computer modelling based on the first result.

Mr Bowe, who writes as 'The Poll Bludger', says there are options.

"You have to go back to 1906 to find the last time an entire state went back to the polls for a Senate election," he said.

"The problem with a Senate election is you've got the entire state going back.

"So, I think as a practical matter, that makes it a lot more tempting for the High Court to try and come up with a solution that doesn't involve all of this aggravation and expense, a big statewide election with over a million people voting."
