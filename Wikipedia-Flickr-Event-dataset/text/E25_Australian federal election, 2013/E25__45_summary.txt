Federal Attorney-General Nicola Roxon is reportedly about to resign from the cabinet.
The Australian on Saturday said Ms Roxon would step down from her portfolio and retire from politics at the September 14 election.
The reports were supported by tweets from Sky News host Peter van Onselen and Seven Network's Mark Riley suggesting Ms Roxon's impending resignation.
"Nicola Roxon to resign from cabinet early tomorrow," van Onselen tweeted late on Friday night.
Ms Roxon's apparent departure comes on the heels of news that the government leader in the Senate, Chris Evans, will resign from the ministry on Saturday.
