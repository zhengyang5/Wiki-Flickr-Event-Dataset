McClelland to quit politics at next electionUpdatedFormer attorney-general Robert McClelland has announced his intention to retire from Parliament at the next election.
Mr McClelland publicly backed Kevin Rudd in last year's leadership ballot, and was demoted by Ms Gillard the following month.
In a subsequent interview, he said his motivation in raising the issue was to make it easier for union members to recover misappropriated money.
The association's funds were used by Ms Gillard's then boyfriend Bruce Wilson as a "slush fund", although he denies suggestions he financially benefitted from it.
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says Mr McClelland will leave Parliament with the respect and best wishes of the Coalition.
