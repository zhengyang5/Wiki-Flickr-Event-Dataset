The entire state of Western Australia could be heading back to the polls in what could prove an early test of the Abbott government's popularity after more than 1300 votes went missing during a recount of WA Senate ballots.
In what would be an unprecedented move, the High Court could order a fresh vote for the six WA Senate spots, giving the state's voters the chance to alter the balance of power in the upper house.
Special Minister of State Michael Ronaldson lashed the Australian Electoral Commission after it revealed it had misplaced 1375 ballot papers, which had been verified during the initial count but could not be located for the recount.
"I have personally expressed to the electoral commissioner my strong view that this situation is totally unsatisfactory and that I, as the responsible minister, view this matter very dimly," Senator Ronaldson said.
