The lack of Aboriginal representation in Parliament is a growing embarrassment for the leaders of major political parties.
In 1999, Aden Ridgeway, a senator from the minor Australian Democrats party, became the second Aborigine in Parliament, lasting for a single six-year term.
Adam Giles became the chief minister of Peris' home state last year, and became the first Aboriginal head of a government.
He failed last year in a bid to recruit an Aboriginal woman lawmaker from the Northern Territory government to contest a federal seat.
She said she was pleased, however, that Australia's major sporting bodies no longer tolerate racism of competitors or spectators.
