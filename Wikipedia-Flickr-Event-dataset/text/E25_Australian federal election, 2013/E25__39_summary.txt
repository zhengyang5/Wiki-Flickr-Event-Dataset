Labor MP to retire at next electionUpdatedMP for Bendigo Steve Gibbons has announced he will retire at the next election, but says the decision has nothing to do with Federal Labor's current problems.
Mr Gibbons has represented the Victorian seat since 1998 and holds the seat with a margin of 6.1 per cent.
Mr Gibbons says he is announcing his retirement now to give Labor's Victorian Administrative Committee time to pre-select a replacement.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard described Mr Gibbons as "the best kind of local member: representing his party in his community, and representing his community in the Parliament".
Mr Gibbons is a member of the Victorian Socialist left faction.
