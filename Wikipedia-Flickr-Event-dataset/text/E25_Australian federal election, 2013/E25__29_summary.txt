Statement from the Australian Electoral Commission: Court of Disputed Returns decisionThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) acknowledges the decision today by His Honour Justice Hayne sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns.
The AEC notes that the Court has advised in its written decision issued today that it finds that the only relief appropriate is for the 2013 Western Australian Senate election result to be declared void.
Therefore his Honour has not yet ordered that the election be declared void.
A writ outlines all the key timings for the election including the dates for the close of the electoral roll, candidate nominations and for election day.
Once a writ has been issued, the AEC will conduct the Western Australian Senate election in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.
