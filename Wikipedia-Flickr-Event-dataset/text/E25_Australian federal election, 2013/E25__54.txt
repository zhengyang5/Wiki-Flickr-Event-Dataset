Bundaberg MP Paul Neville to quit

Posted

Bundaberg federal MP Paul Neville says he will retire from the southern Queensland seat in Parliament at the next election.

Mr Neville, the federal Member for Hinkler, has served seven terms in Parliament since 1993.

Born in Warwick, in southern Queensland, Mr Neville, 72, has also been the National Party whip since 1998.

He says the timing is right for him to retire from Parliament at the next federal election.

Mr Neville notified the Queensland Liberal National Party president on Monday of his intention not to stand for re-election and says he is happy with his decision.

"I've had a very good run coming up on 20 years, very few members of Parliament get a run as long as that," Mr Neville said.

"This is a time when we have a 10.4 per cent margin in Hinkler - we are on an upswing on the polls.

"I think that's the time if you are coming to change horses, that's the time to do it."
