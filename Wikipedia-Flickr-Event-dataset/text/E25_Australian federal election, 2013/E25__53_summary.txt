Humphries farewells Senate after 24 years in politicsUpdatedOutgoing Liberal Senator for the ACT Gary Humphries has given his valedictory speech to the Senate.
Senator Humphries entered the Senate in 2003 after serving in the ACT Assembly for 14 years.
In 2006, Senator Humphries famously told John Howard that he could not support the Federal Government overriding Territory legislation which legally recognised same sex relationships.
Senator Humphries crossed the floor, something he recently reflected cost him votes in his pre-selection battle.
At 54 years of age, Senator Humphries says he is young enough to start a new career developing public policy in Canberra.
