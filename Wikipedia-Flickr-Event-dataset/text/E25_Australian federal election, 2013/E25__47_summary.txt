Senate President Hogg announces retirementUpdatedLabor veteran and Senate President John Hogg has announced he will not re-contest his Senate seat.
Senator Hogg entered Federal Parliament in 1996 and was appointed president in 2008.
Senator Hogg was one of the factional figures that helped Julia Gillard force Kevin Rudd from the leadership.
Several Labor MPs have announced they will not re-contest their seats at the next election, including former speaker Harry Jenkins.
The ALP has preselected lawyer Andrew Giles to run for the Mr Jenkins's safe seat of Scullin in Victoria.
