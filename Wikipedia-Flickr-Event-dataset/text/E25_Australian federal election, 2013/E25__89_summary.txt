Kevin Rudd, Australian prime minister, has made a major campaign pitch to revive the Australian Labor Party's chances at elections this week.
"It is a fight about the values that underpin Australia's future, a fight about our vision for Australia's future.
"It's a fight about how we go about building Australia's future, a future for the many, not just for the few."
"These feel like relatively minor announcements at this stage in the election campaign," he said.
Queensland is a battleground state for swing seats that will decide the election on September 7.
