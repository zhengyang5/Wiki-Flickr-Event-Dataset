Lib MP to quit federal politicsLiberal MP Joanna Gash will quit federal politics at the next election to resume a career in local government.
Ms Gash, who has held the NSW south coast seat of Gilmore for 16 years, is keen to become mayor of the Shoalhaven Shire.
Ms Gash said local government had always been an attraction for her.
Ms Gash will continue as the region's federal MP regardless of the mayoral election, due in September, until a general election likely in late 2013.
The MP previously was a councillor in the Wingecarribee Shire in the NSW Southern Highlands.
