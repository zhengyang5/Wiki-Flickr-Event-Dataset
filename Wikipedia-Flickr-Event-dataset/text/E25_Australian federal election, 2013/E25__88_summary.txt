Ed Killesteyn resigns as Australian Electoral CommissionerUpdatedAustralian Electoral Commissioner Ed Killesteyn has resigned following a major bungle at the last election which will see a fresh Senate poll held in Western Australia.
Mr Killesteyn had been the Electoral Commissioner since 2009 and had been reappointed to the role for another five years beginning last month.
In a statement, Special Minister of State Michael Ronaldson says Mr Killesteyn has formally tendered his resignation to the Governor-General.
The Government says Deputy Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers will act in the top job until a new commissioner is appointed.
"The Government will in due course announce a new electoral commissioner who will be charged with the restoration of that confidence," the Minister said.
