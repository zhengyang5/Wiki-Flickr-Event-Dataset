A Sunday newspaper's front page saying Australia needs Tony Abbott has prompted a furious debate as to whether it's blatant political propaganda, or simply the right of a private business to express its views.
David is the author of Rupert Murdoch: An Investigation of Political Power, and is a former ABC and Fairfax journalist.
David says when the election campaign began, the Daily Telegraph ran a front page with the headline "Throw This Mob Out".
"What the Sunday Telegraph has done is run an editorial, so-called, on its front page with a gigantic photo of Tony Abbott," he says.
"Yes, Fairfax also has editiorial positions and probably in favour of Abbott too, but they don't turn their front page over into a campaign organ of a political party."
