Ms Gillard confirmed this morning her fellow Victorian MP, Mark Dreyfus, QC, will take over as Attorney-General.
An emotional Ms Roxon said she was ''very torn'' about leaving but that her desire to spend time with her husband and their young daughter had won out.
Ms Roxon said she believed Mr Dreyfus would step into her vacate Cabinet role seamlessly.
Ms Gillard said both Senator Evans and Ms Roxon approached her 12 months ago with their plans to not contest the 2013 election.
"We agreed at the right time they would relinquish their ministerial roles and I would make new appointments," Ms Gillard said.
