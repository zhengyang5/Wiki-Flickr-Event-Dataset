Julia Gillard remains as Prime Minister and Labor leader this evening after an expected Kevin Rudd challenge failed to materialise during another extraordinary day in Canberra.
There followed a feverish couple of hours of speculation, focusing on whether or not Mr Rudd would actually run.
But Mr Rudd appeared before the cameras just 10 minutes before the expected vote to reveal he would not stand.
Mr Crean had 'pulled the trigger' on leadership speculation, saying it needs to be sorted today, so the party can move on.
Ms Gillard has faced months of damaging leadership speculation, with polls repeatedly showing the ALP would face a landslide election loss under her leadership.
