KEVIN Rudd supporter Kim Carr has resigned from Prime Minister Julia Gillard's outer ministry.
Senator Carr, who was human services minister, on Friday became the third minister to resign, behind cabinet ministers Martin Ferguson and Chris Bowen.
Senator Carr, who also backed Mr Rudd when he challenged in February 2012, said he had not made his decision lightly.
"Given yesterday's events, and the current circumstance, I have thought the principal course of action was to offer the prime minister my resignation," Senator Carr said.
