Motoring Enthusiasts Party member Ricky Muir wins Senate seatUpdatedThe Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party (AMEP) will be represented by Ricky Muir in the Senate.
The news follows an announcement from the Australian Electoral Commission confirming the results of the six Senate seats for Victoria.
Mr Muir ran for the Senate campaigning on road safety and increasing the rights for four wheel drive vehicle owners.
The 32-year-old father of five, who says he wants to bring balance to the Senate, edged out Helen Kroger for Victoria's sixth and final spot.
The results are expected to be declared in Western Australia tomorrow, where Greens Senator Scott Ludlum is in danger of losing his seat.
