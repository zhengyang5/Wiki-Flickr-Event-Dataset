Details on how Liberal National Party double-crosser Peter Slipper was groomed by the ALP to take on the role of Speaker in the nation's Parliament can now be revealed.
At the time, Speaker Harry Jenkins lost a vote on the floor to suspend Liberal MP Bob Baldwin from the House of Representatives.
Albanese and Slipper both knew it would lead to the Queensland MP being thrown out of the LNP.
McIver told Slipper there were three options: do nothing, bring on an early pre-selection or be disciplined.
Before Jenkins told the Parliament of his decision, Slipper was advised at 7.30am of what was planned.
