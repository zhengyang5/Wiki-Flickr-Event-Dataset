Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey and Julie Bishop have been asked this very question in the last week.
LYNDAL CURTIS: A question to Mr Rudd but to you too Mr Abbott on the issue of trust.
HARTCHER: I'm happy to quote you back to you any time, Mr Abbott.
SPEERS: Mr Abbott.
And what I am saying, Mr Abbott, you might laugh but what you said was a little inaccurate.
