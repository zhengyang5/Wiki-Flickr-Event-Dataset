The re-run poll for WA's six Senate seats will be held on April 5, and will be a rare opportunity to provide voter feedback to a newly elected federal government.
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop warned against voting for "fringe-dweller" parties, saying they could "create chaos".
"What we need to do is ensure there is a strong representation from WA inside the government - Labor senators can't deliver that, minor parties can't deliver that, fringe-dwelling parties can't deliver that."
"There is a resentment in WA that the state does not get a fair go," the Palmer United Party (PUP) leader said.
Senator Ludlam said the poll was a "unique and extraordinary opportunity" for the electorate to send a message to Mr Abbott not to take WA for granted.
