Saturday, June 15th, 2013Local member Barry Haase has decided to retire from federal politics.
“Today I announce my decision to withdraw my nomination for re-election as the Liberal member for the seat of Durack at the forthcoming Federal election,” Mr Haase said.
Since 1998 I have represented firstly the electorate of Kalgoorlie and from 2010, the electorate of Durack.
The September Federal election will give Durack residents the opportunity to contribute to getting Australia back on track.
The elected Liberal member for Durack will be part of the team that will provide hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians.
