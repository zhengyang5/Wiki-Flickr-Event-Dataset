Senate President Hogg announces retirement

Updated

Labor veteran and Senate President John Hogg has announced he will not re-contest his Senate seat.

Senator Hogg entered Federal Parliament in 1996 and was appointed president in 2008.

He says he will serve out the rest of his term but he will leave federal politics when it ends in mid 2014.

Nominations for his seat open next week.

Senator Hogg says he looks forward to spending more time with his family and he has the luxury of leaving the Parliament at a time of his own choosing.

He also says he will do everything he can to make sure the Labor Government is re-elected.

Senator Hogg was one of the factional figures that helped Julia Gillard force Kevin Rudd from the leadership.

Several Labor MPs have announced they will not re-contest their seats at the next election, including former speaker Harry Jenkins.

The ALP has preselected lawyer Andrew Giles to run for the Mr Jenkins's safe seat of Scullin in Victoria.
