Debate Round 2 breathes life into leaders' dialogueUpdatedAfter the dull performances of Rudd and Abbott in the first leaders debate, Round 2 was the closest we've seen to a dialogue between the two, writes Melissa Clarke.
The leaders' debate, Round 2.
Kevin Rudd was the first to engage his opponent, in what was clearly a strategic move.
Tony Abbott: "I want to be Mr Build, Build, Build, so we can have jobs, jobs, jobs."
But with both Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott looking energised from Round 2, it won't be long before the terms of Round 3 are agreed upon for a final tête-à-tête.
