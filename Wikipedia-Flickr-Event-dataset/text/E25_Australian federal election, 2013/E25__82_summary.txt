Probe launched into lost WA Senate ballot papersThe West Australian Senate recount in Perth.
The Australian Electoral Commission has called in former federal police commissioner Mick Keelty to investigate the loss of 1375 ballot papers missing from the WA Senate recount.
He would establish the facts regarding the missing ballot papers, and identify any procedural failures that may have occurred.
Mr Diak said there had been an exhaustive, but ultimately unsuccessful, search for the missing ballot papers.
Senate Ludlam says the ballot papers must be found before any result can be declared.
