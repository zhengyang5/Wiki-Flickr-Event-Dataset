The Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has offered conditional support for increasing the Medicare levy, prompting the Prime Minister Julia Gillard to bring that legislation forward.
JULIA GILLARD: I will bring to the Parliament the legislation to increase the Medicare levy by half a per cent.
TONY ABBOTT: We are prepared to consider a supporting - a modest increase in the Medicare levy to make sure that this happens as soon as possible.
JULIA GILLARD: The Leader of the Opposition today has said he is prepared to support an increase in the Medicare levy.
Mr Abbott has already signalled that he'll seek to remove the Medicare levy increase once the budget's back into a strong surplus and the policy can be funded without it.
