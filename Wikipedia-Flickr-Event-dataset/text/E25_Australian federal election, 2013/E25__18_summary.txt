If the election will be close, the Senate election will be even closer.
There are 54 parties registered to contest this poll - and the Senate ballot paper will be huge.
The outcome in every state will be decided by preference deals negotiated by those 54 parties.
This is an election for half the Senate.
The half we elected in 2010 will continue.
