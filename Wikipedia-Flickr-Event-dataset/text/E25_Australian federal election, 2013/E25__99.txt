WikiLeaks founder brushes off election loss, saying he will try again for a Senate position

Julian Assange says his WikiLeaks party will live on despite its poor showing in the Australian election.

With about two-thirds of Senate first preferences counted, the party picked up 0.62% of the national vote.

Its best showing was in Victoria, where Assange was the lead candidate for the Senate and where it garnered 1.18% of the primary vote.

In New South Wales it picked up 0.8% and in Western Australia 0.71%.

But none of these numbers were good enough to get its candidates elected.

"We are the second largest vote count for the new parties after Clive Palmer's party, which had a billion bucks behind it," Assange told ABC TV on Sunday. "I think that's a pretty good outcome."

The WikiLeaks founder said it was "rather bizarre" that the Australian Motoring Enthusiast party was being projected to win a Victorian Senate spot when that party "has less than a third of the vote that we had".

Projections are made according to preference flows from the tickets lodged by all parties before the election.

Asked if he would try again for a Senate seat in three or six years' time, Assange said: "I think so. The WikiLeaks Party will continue for sure," he said.
