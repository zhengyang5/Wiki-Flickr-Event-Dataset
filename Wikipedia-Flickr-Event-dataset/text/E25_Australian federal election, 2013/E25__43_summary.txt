JULIA Gillard has suffered a blow in central Queensland, with her only MP in the region planning to quit at the next election.
Capricornia MP Kirsten Livermore will not contest the next election.
Ms Livermore had previously renominated for the seat, which is based around Rockhampton.
But she has now decided to resign at next year's election, saying she wants to spend more time with her family.
The move comes after senior Labor figures had privately warned they were worried about losing Ms Livermore's marginal electorate, which she has held since 1998.
