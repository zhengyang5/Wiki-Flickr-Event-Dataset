Bundaberg MP Paul Neville to quitPostedBundaberg federal MP Paul Neville says he will retire from the southern Queensland seat in Parliament at the next election.
Mr Neville, the federal Member for Hinkler, has served seven terms in Parliament since 1993.
Born in Warwick, in southern Queensland, Mr Neville, 72, has also been the National Party whip since 1998.
He says the timing is right for him to retire from Parliament at the next federal election.
"I've had a very good run coming up on 20 years, very few members of Parliament get a run as long as that," Mr Neville said.
