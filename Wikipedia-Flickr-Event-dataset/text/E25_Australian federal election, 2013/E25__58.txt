Veteran Nationals MP John Forrest retires

Posted

The long-serving Nationals MP John Forrest will not contest this year's federal election for his seat in north-western Victorian.

John Forrest was elected the Federal Member for Mallee in 1993.

It is the Coalition's safest seat with a margin of just over 23 per cent.

Mr Forrest announced his retirement at the Wimmera Machinery Field Days at Longrenong, near Horsham, citing health reasons and wanting to spend more time with his family.

Mr Forrest says the role has been one of the greatest honours of his life.

"My ongoing commitment to the interests of rural Australia will continue but perhaps in a different supportive role," he said.

Federal Nationals leader Warren Truss has paid tribute to his colleague.

"John has consistently enjoyed the respect and admiration of all sides of the Parliament,' he said.

"That he has done so over such a long innings is testimony to his character.

"John was also a major driver behind the new Robinvale Bridge, a very busy interstate river crossing, and lobbied hard for the new Horsham Freight Centre."

The Nationals' Mildura District Council's president Alan Malcolm says Mr Forrest has been a reliable MP with a terrific reputation.

He says he expects a tough contest for the Mallee seat with many Nationals members already lining up for pre-selection.

"It was always considered a very safe country Party National Party seat," he said.

"I know of at least six or seven prospective candidates that've indicated at some stage they'd be interested."

Mr Malcolm says he is also anticipating competition from the Liberals and the Greens.

The Nationals have held the Mallee seat since it was created in 1949.

The federal election will be held on September 14.
