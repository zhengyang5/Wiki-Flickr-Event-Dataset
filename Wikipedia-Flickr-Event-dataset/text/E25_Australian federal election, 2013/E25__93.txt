Now, traditionally its been the medias job to put such claims under scrutiny.



But in this campaign, even in the Quality Press, its hard to know if youre being given the facts.



On Friday morning The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian both led the front page with the latest job numbers. But their line could hardly have been more different.





Jobs boost as working hours hit a record high



Unemployment has defied predictions of an increase and the number of hours worked by Australians has climbed to a record high ...

Rudd wrong as Qld jobs jump



Kevin Rudd has been thrown on the defensive on economic management after a surprise fall in full-time jobs offset by strong growth in Queensland ...



— The Australian, 9th August, 2013



One story. One set of figures. But two papers with an entirely different spin.



And how about this?





Send in the clown



— The Courier-Mail, 9th August, 2013



That damning headline on the front of Rupert Murdochs Courier-Mail on Friday had one clear purpose: to damage Labor in Queensland.



The supposed excuse was that former Premier Peter Beattie who had agreed to stand for a federal seat was:





... known for his love of clowning around for the cameras ...



— The Courier-Mail, 9th August, 2013



In other words, calling him a clown was just a bit of fun.



That was also the excuse for the front page of Sydneys Daily Telegraph the previous day, showing Labors Kevin Rudd and Anthony Albanese in Nazi uniforms.

I KNOW NUTHINK!



— Daily Telegraph, 8th August, 2013



As an article inside the paper explained, the slogan and the picture they had photo-shopped were from the vintage American TV show Hogans Heroes.



It was brilliant, funny and biting. Or so the Tele and its readers thought next day.





What a front pageyou guys are just way too clever, I love it.



— Daily Telegraph, 9th August, 2013





Ive just recovered from half an hour of continuous laughing.



— Daily Telegraph, 9th August, 2013





I love The Daily Telegraphs front pages and hope more aare to come.



— Daily Telegraph, 9th August, 2013



More to come? Im sure there will be.



After all, who could forget the way the Tele kicked off the election campaign last Monday?





Finally, you now have the chance to ... KICK THIS MOB OUT



— Daily Telegraph, 5th August, 2013



That front-page editorial also brought plenty of positive comment from the Telegraphs readers.





Richard: The best front page that ever there was. Period.



— Daily Telegraph, 6th August, 2013





Shane: Congrats to Sydneys Daily Telegraph on your front page. Unfiltered, real & definitely true.



— Daily Telegraph, 6th August, 2013



But not everyone was thrilled.



On the Telegraphs Facebook page more than 300 negative or angry comments were posted, against around 20 in support of the papers action



Matt

I have never seen a more biased front page to a newspaper in all my life ... It was disgusting. You should be ashamed.



— Facebook, August, 2013





Katie

You are an utter disgrace. Your job is to present the facts objectively.



— Facebook, August, 2013





Tony

the lowest of the lows, Australian journalism today hit rock bottom.

The Press Council was also hit with a flood of complaints, some of which were couched in similar terms.



The 77 complaints for kick this mob out were instantly rejected however, because it was marked Editorial and newspapers have every right to express an opinion.



But a further 19 complaints about dressing Rudd and Albanese in Nazi uniforms are still being considered.



And its not just those two front pages that have taken an anti Labor line. Heres a selection of headlines from Saturdays Telegraph.

DEBT GROWS BY $8.6b IN SIX WEEKS SINCE RUDD BECAME PM



— Daily Telegraph, 10th August, 2013



Meanwhile the papers hard-hitting scrutiny of the Coalition told us





TONY PROUD TO SHOW OFF HIS GIRLS



— Daily Telegraph, 10th August, 2013





POPULAR HOWARD STILL HAS HIS COMMON TOUCH



— Daily Telegraph, 10th August, 2013



Last week we counted some 80 election stories in the Telegraph.



In our judgement, only one of these was pro-Labor. Six favoured the Coalition, and 33 were neutral.



But the other 40 stories, exactly half the total, were negative to Labor.



Now, we havent examined them all in detail but we fail to see how this coverage fits in with News Corp Australias Professional Code of Conduct which decrees:





1.2 Publications should take reasonable steps to ensure reports are accurate, fair and balanced.



1.4 Try always to tell all sides of the story in any kind of dispute.

After the Teles kick this mob out front page last Monday, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd fired a broadside at Rupert Murdoch over the Telegraphs attack.



And on Friday, after the Hogans Heroes front page, he was rattled enough to fire another.



Kevin Rudd: Fact number one is that Mr Murdoch has said in black and white that he wants Mr Abbott to be the next Prime Minister of Australia. Fact number two is that Mr Murdoch owns 70 per cent of newspapers in this country, 70 per cent of the print media. Fact number three, we also know as a fact that Mr Murdoch has sent out one of his right hand men, Mr Allan, from New York to Australia, in recent weeks. Number four is a fact that we know from, in fact, News Limited editors that a large number of them were called to a meeting with Mr Allan in Sydney last week. And number five, what we know from that meeting, because those editors have spoken a bit to various people, is that the message delivered very clearly was to them Go hard on Rudd. Start from Sunday and don't back off.



— ABC News 24, 9th August, 2013



In the 1992 British election, Murdochs Sun newspaper waged a famous campaign against Labours Neil Kinnock, which it capped off with this memorable appeal to voters.





IF KINNOCK WINS TODAY WILL THE LAST PERSON TO LEAVE BRITAIN PLEASE TURN OUT THE LIGHTS



— The Sun, 9th April, 1992



Two days later, after a narrow and unexpected Tory victory, the paper famously crowed.





ITS THE SUN WOT WON IT



— The Sun, 9th April, 1992



Murdochs Sun has backed the winner of Britains elections every time in the last 43 years.



The polls suggest that in this campaign Murdochs Daily Telegraph is also on the winner.



And given the strong line theyre taking theyll certainly be hoping they have picked it right.



And we should add that Mr Rudds claim that News Corp owns 70 per cent of the newspapers in this country is False. According to Newscorp its responsible for 63 per cent of Australian newspaper sales.
