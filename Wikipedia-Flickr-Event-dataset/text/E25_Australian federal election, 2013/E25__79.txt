As it happened: Coalition releases costings, Kevin Rudd speaks at Press Club

Updated

Shadow treasurer Joe Hockey and Opposition finance spokesman Andrew Robb have released the Coalition's long-awaited costings figures.

Mr Hockey said the budget bottom line would be $6 billion better off under a Coalition government, and announced another $9 billion in savings.

The announcement comes after Opposition Leader Tony Abbott earlier defended the Coalition's decision not to have its Direct Action climate policy and broadband plan independently costed, saying the measures were "bulletproof".

Mr Abbott said nothing would be off-limits to a post-election commission of audit, prompting Labor to warn the Coalition had "deep cuts" in store.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has used his last set-piece address to the nation before Saturday's election to attack the Coalition as "cynical" and defend Labor's time in office.

Late in the day the Coalition got into a tangle over a "badly worded" internet filter policy.
