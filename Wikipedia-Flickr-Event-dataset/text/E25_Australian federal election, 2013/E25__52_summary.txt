SABRA LANE: Dr Washer, the Western Australian Liberal State Council on the weekend voted in favour of a Royal Commission on the climate change science.
And overwhelmingly the majority of climate change scientists believe of course global warming is a reality.
It will achieve nothing, cost the taxpayers money and I don't know who brought that up and I don't know who'd be silly enough to support it.
MAL WASHER: Well, look I don't think that, I think that makes us look silly.
MAL WASHER: Look, Tony is not a scientist and to be fair to him, it is not weightless.
