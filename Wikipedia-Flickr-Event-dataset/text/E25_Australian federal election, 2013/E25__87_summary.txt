Court of Disputed Returns voids 2013 WA Senate election resultThe AEC acknowledges the order issued today by His Honour Justice Hayne sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns to void the 2013 Western Australian Senate election result.
A writ outlines all the key timings for the election including the dates for the close of the electoral roll, candidate nominations and for election day.
Once a writ has been issued, the AEC will conduct the Western Australian Senate election in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.
Editorâ€™s note:The AEC does not play a role in determining when a writ is issued.
The AEC receives the writ once it has been issued by the Governor of Western Australia, and then conducts the election according to the prescribed timetable contained in the Writ.
