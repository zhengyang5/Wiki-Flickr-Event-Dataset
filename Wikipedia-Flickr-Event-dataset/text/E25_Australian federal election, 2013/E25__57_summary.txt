THE two vacant spots on the Queensland Liberal National Party (LNP) Senate ticket should go to women, retiring senator Sue Boyce says.
Senator Boyce, the only female Queensland LNP representative in the upper house, has announced she will not contest another term because she wants to spend more time with family.
"There's no reason why both those positions couldn't go to women," Senator Boyce told the Courier-Mail on Monday.
"I don't see tokenism as playing any role in this whatsoever," Senator Boyce told ABC Radio in Brisbane.
The LNP Queensland Senate nominations closed on Monday and preselection will be on November 24.
