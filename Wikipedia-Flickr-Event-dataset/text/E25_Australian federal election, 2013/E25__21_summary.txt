Mr Abbott said his job was to be ''respectful and courteous'' to all members of Parliament, including minor party MPs.
''I think this is an issue, and I think it will have to be addressed,'' Mr Abbott said.
Mr Abbott said he didn't want to recall Parliament until new legislation, particularly to repeal the carbon tax, is ready.
''I'm in no rush to move out of Forestville and I don't think the family is either,'' Mr Abbott said.
Outgoing prime minister Kevin Rudd is expected to welcome Mr Abbott to The Lodge at some stage later in the week.
