High Court judge reserves judgment on botched West Australian Senate electionUpdatedWest Australian voters will have to wait to find out if they will have to return to the polls in a new Senate election.
High Court Justice Kenneth Hayne has reserved his decision in a Court of Disputed Returns hearing in Melbourne.
Over two days, the court heard submissions on a petition by the Australian Electoral Commission to have last year's election declared void.
The Commission believes the election was rendered illegal because more than 1,000 votes were lost in the counting.
Mr Donaghue told the court only 23 of the lost votes bore an effect on the actual result.
