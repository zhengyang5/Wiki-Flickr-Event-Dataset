Kevin Rudd wins Caucus support for Labor party reform at special meeting in BalmainUpdatedThe federal Labor Caucus has approved the Prime Minister's plan to allow party members half the votes in electing the leader of the party.
Caucus members gathered at Balmain Town Hall to vote on the reforms, which Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has said were aimed at bringing back disillusioned party members and encouraging others.
However, they decided Mr Rudd's proposal for a 75 per cent threshold of Caucus support to trigger a leadership ballot in opposition was too high.
"The Australian public now have certainty, Australians demand to know that the prime minister they elect is the prime minister they get and that is underlined by these reforms."
Before the gathering, Deputy Prime Minister Anthony Albanese ruled out an election announcement today, saying: "I can assure you that the PM is not planning to visit Yarralumla today."
