Veteran Nationals MP John Forrest retiresPostedThe long-serving Nationals MP John Forrest will not contest this year's federal election for his seat in north-western Victorian.
John Forrest was elected the Federal Member for Mallee in 1993.
The Nationals' Mildura District Council's president Alan Malcolm says Mr Forrest has been a reliable MP with a terrific reputation.
He says he expects a tough contest for the Mallee seat with many Nationals members already lining up for pre-selection.
"It was always considered a very safe country Party National Party seat," he said.
