Malcolm Turnbull says Coalition will not introduce opt-out internet filter after earlier supporting itUpdatedThe Coalition has backflipped on plans to enforce an opt-out internet filter, just hours after releasing the policy.
The plans, which would have been a stark turnaround after the Coalition's stance against Labor's formerly proposed mandatory internet filter, were slammed on social media.
The Opposition document said the opt-out filter would be similar to the one active in the United Kingdom.
"I'm sorry that it was poorly worded but that's been cleared up... we don't support filtering the internet.
Former communications minister Stephen Conroy dumped plans for a compulsory internet filter after fierce lobbying from rights advocates and criticism from the Coalition.
