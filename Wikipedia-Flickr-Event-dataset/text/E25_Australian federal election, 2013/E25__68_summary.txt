Julian Assange and others from the whistleblower organisation will contest Senate seats in the coming electionThe political arm of the global whistleblower organisation WikiLeaks has been formally registered by the Australian Electoral Commission in time for the federal election where the party plans to contest Senate seats in three Australian states.
The WikiLeaks party received formal registration on Tuesday and was registered under the name of Gail Malone, a member of the party's national council and described as a "peace activist" on their website.
Greg Barns, the WikiLeaks party campaign manager, said news of the registration meant the party would now focus on setting out key policy positions in the coming weeks.
He added that the party was drawing closer to announcing who, along with Julian Assange, would contest seats for the party.
At present, Julian Assange is the only confirmed WikiLeaks party candidate.
