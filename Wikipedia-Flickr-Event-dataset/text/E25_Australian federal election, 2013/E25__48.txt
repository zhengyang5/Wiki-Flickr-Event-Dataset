Lib MP to quit federal politics

Liberal MP Joanna Gash will quit federal politics at the next election to resume a career in local government.

Ms Gash, who has held the NSW south coast seat of Gilmore for 16 years, is keen to become mayor of the Shoalhaven Shire.

The time has come for a change of direction, she said in a statement on Wednesday.

"I want to give something back the community that has sustained me for more than 60 years."

Ms Gash said local government had always been an attraction for her.

"I believe I can offer the community more through that tier of government."

Ms Gash will continue as the region's federal MP regardless of the mayoral election, due in September, until a general election likely in late 2013.

"This does not mean I will be slackening off in any way at all," she said.

Ms Gash said her decision came after consulting family and close friends over the holidays.

The MP previously was a councillor in the Wingecarribee Shire in the NSW Southern Highlands.
