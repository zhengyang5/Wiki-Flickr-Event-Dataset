Labor clings to powerUpdatedIndependents Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott have broken Australia's political deadlock by agreeing to back Julia Gillard in a Labor minority government.
After more than a fortnight of suspense, Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor today revealed their intention to give Labor their crucial votes, meaning it has secured the 76 seats needed to rule.
Ms Gillard is due to speak at 4:15pm (AEST) about the deal she clinched with Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott which will see her continue on as prime minister.
He also made a plea to his conservative constituents not to turn away from a Labor government.
Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor join newly elected independent MP Andrew Wilkie and Greens MP Adam Bandt in pledging their support for a Labor minority government.
