As it happened: Coalition releases costings, Kevin Rudd speaks at Press ClubUpdatedShadow treasurer Joe Hockey and Opposition finance spokesman Andrew Robb have released the Coalition's long-awaited costings figures.
Mr Hockey said the budget bottom line would be $6 billion better off under a Coalition government, and announced another $9 billion in savings.
Mr Abbott said nothing would be off-limits to a post-election commission of audit, prompting Labor to warn the Coalition had "deep cuts" in store.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has used his last set-piece address to the nation before Saturday's election to attack the Coalition as "cynical" and defend Labor's time in office.
Late in the day the Coalition got into a tangle over a "badly worded" internet filter policy.
