The AEC had given a signal that it may take the initiative in petitioning the court itself after 1,375 ballots went missing in a recount of the disputed 2013 WA Senate election.
“The petition seeks an order from the court that the WA Senate election of six senators be declared void,” it said in a statement issued Friday afternoon.
“The government expects the commission to conduct a detailed internal investigation as well as acting on any recommendations arising from the Keelty investigation.”The AEC declared the WA result despite the missing ballots, triggering the 40-day process for petitions to the high court.
The original result declared the final two WA Senate spots for the Palmer United party and the ALP.
After the recount requested by Ludlam, the final two places were awarded to the Greens and to the Sports party.
