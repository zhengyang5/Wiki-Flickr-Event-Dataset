Elected Candidates

Note:The elected candidates listed below are those declared elected based on a re-count. The calculator output is based on the first count and produced a different result, the last two seats being won by the Palmer United Party's Zhenya Wang and Labor's Louise Pratt. Votes missing on the re-count, plus the extreme closeness of the result, have resulted in a Court of Disputed Returns challenge to the results. It is possible a re-election will be required.

A summary of the actual distribution of preferences for the first count in Western Australia can be found at Antony Green's Election Blog. You can also read posts about the problem of missing votes in the re-count, and how the result came down to just one vote if the missing votes as counted originally were included in the count. The count sheets for the re-count can be found at Australian Electoral Commission's website.
