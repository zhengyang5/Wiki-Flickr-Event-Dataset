Elected CandidatesNote:The elected candidates listed below are those declared elected based on a re-count.
Votes missing on the re-count, plus the extreme closeness of the result, have resulted in a Court of Disputed Returns challenge to the results.
A summary of the actual distribution of preferences for the first count in Western Australia can be found at Antony Green's Election Blog.
You can also read posts about the problem of missing votes in the re-count, and how the result came down to just one vote if the missing votes as counted originally were included in the count.
