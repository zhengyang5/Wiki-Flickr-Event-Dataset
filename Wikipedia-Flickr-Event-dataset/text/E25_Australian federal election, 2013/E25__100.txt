As it happened: Day four dominated by return of Peter Beattie, as Rudd-Murdoch war heats up

Updated

High-profile former Queensland premier Peter Beattie has made a dramatic return to politics on day four of the federal election campaign.

Mr Beattie, who stood down as Queensland premier in 2007 and never lost an election, will run as a federal Labor candidate in the LNP-held seat of Forde, south of Brisbane.

Meanwhile Tony Abbott has denied Kevin Rudd's suggestions that he has discussed the National Broadband Network with Rupert Murdoch, while Mr Murdoch's Daily Telegraph has upped the ante with a front page depicting the PM and Anthony Albanese as German soldiers from Hogan's Heroes.
