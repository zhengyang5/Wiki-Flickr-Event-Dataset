ELECTION: Coalition shy of Senate majorityAAPAustralian voters look set to deliver a jumbled Senate where the balance of power is held by minor party players including a former footballer, prompting senior parliamentarians to call for a review of the election process.
A complex system of preferencing will likely deny the coalition a 39-seat majority in the upper house, while granting a Senate ticket to newcomers like former rugby league player Glenn Lazarus in Queensland for the Palmer United Party.
Independent Nick Xenophon will be returned in South Australia where Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young's place remains in doubt.
The Liberal Democrats were positioned first on the lengthy Senate ballot paper and commentators suspect some voters mistook the party name for "Liberal".
Despite little campaigning, the party picked up close to nine per cent of the NSW Senate vote.
