Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has tried to silence one of his MPs who entered negotiations with the Government for the job of Deputy Speaker.
Queensland Liberal Alex Somlyay confirmed yesterday that an offer had been made for him to be the Government's preferred nominee.
Mr Abbott did not respond to the allegation that he had put words into Mr Somlyay's mouth.
But Labor needs an Opposition MP as the Deputy Speaker to balance the vote it will lose to the Speaker's chair.
To do that the Government also needs a ''pairing'' arrangement in place between the Speaker and the deputy.
