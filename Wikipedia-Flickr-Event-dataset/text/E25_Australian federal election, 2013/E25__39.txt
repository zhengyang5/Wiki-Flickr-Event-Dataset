Labor MP to retire at next election

Updated

MP for Bendigo Steve Gibbons has announced he will retire at the next election, but says the decision has nothing to do with Federal Labor's current problems.

Mr Gibbons has represented the Victorian seat since 1998 and holds the seat with a margin of 6.1 per cent.

He will be 65 if the election is held on schedule in late 2013, but says the "current political environment had no bearing on his decision".

"All governments' fortunes ebb and flow, and the current situation is no different to the position the Howard government was experiencing in 2001," he said in a statement.

"As the election drew closer the polls evened out, as they always do.

"History has shown the Howard government recovered and went on to win the 2001 election comfortably. I expect Labor will do the same and be very competitive in 2013."

Mr Gibbons says he is announcing his retirement now to give Labor's Victorian Administrative Committee time to pre-select a replacement.

Prime Minister Julia Gillard described Mr Gibbons as "the best kind of local member: representing his party in his community, and representing his community in the Parliament".

"Beyond the next election, I'm sure he is looking forward to some good times noodling on his bass guitar and working on his motorbikes," Ms Gillard said in a press release.

"While I will be sorry to see Steve go, I will wish him well when he does embark on this new phase in his life."

Bendigo is a traditionally swinging seat, held by the Liberal's Bruce Reid from 1990 to 1998, when Mr Gibbons won with a swing of 4.4 per cent.

Mr Gibbons is a member of the Victorian Socialist left faction.
