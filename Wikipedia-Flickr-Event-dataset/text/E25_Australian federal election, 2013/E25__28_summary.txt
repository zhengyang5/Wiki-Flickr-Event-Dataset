Electoral Commission challenges WA Senate result to bring about fresh electionUpdatedThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has announced it is challenging the West Australian Senate result to try to bring about a fresh election.
The AEC lodged a petition with the Court of Disputed Returns this afternoon, seeking an order that the election of six senators in WA be declared void.
Green says if the missing votes were to be included in the recount, the PUP and Labor would have won the final two spots.
The other Senate seats were taken by the Liberal Party's David Johnston, Michaelia Cash, Linda Reynolds and Labor's Joe Bullock.
Earlier this week, Mr Keelty said the votes disappeared some time between the day after the election and a re-count last month.
