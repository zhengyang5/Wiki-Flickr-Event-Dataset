Motoring Enthusiasts Party member Ricky Muir wins Senate seat

Updated

The Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party (AMEP) will be represented by Ricky Muir in the Senate.

The news follows an announcement from the Australian Electoral Commission confirming the results of the six Senate seats for Victoria.

Mr Muir ran for the Senate campaigning on road safety and increasing the rights for four wheel drive vehicle owners.

The 32-year-old father of five, who says he wants to bring balance to the Senate, edged out Helen Kroger for Victoria's sixth and final spot.

He will be joined in the Upper House by Mitch Fifield and Scott Ryan of the Coalition, Labor's Gavin Marshall and Jacinta Collins and the Greens' Janet Rice.

Liberal Senator and Chief Coalition Whip Helen Kroger lost her re-election bid in Victoria.

The six successful candidates will be formally declared on Wednesday.

The AEC also announced Labor's Kate Lundy and the Liberals' Zed Seselja have been elected as the ACT's two Senators.

The Greens candidate Simon Sheikh had already conceded defeat.

In South Australia, Labor Senator Don Farrell was edged out by Bob Day from Family First.

Senator Farrell says he is disappointed at the result but has hinted at a return.

"Sometimes they call me the Godfather. There's been a number of sequels for the Godfather, so maybe there'll be one for me," he said.

The results are expected to be declared in Western Australia tomorrow, where Greens Senator Scott Ludlum is in danger of losing his seat.
