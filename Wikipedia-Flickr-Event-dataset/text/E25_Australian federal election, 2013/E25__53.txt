Humphries farewells Senate after 24 years in politics

Updated

Outgoing Liberal Senator for the ACT Gary Humphries has given his valedictory speech to the Senate.

Senator Humphries entered the Senate in 2003 after serving in the ACT Assembly for 14 years.

He used his speech to urge his Liberal Party colleagues not to run down Canberra if there is a change of Government in September.

"Canberra is pivotal," he said.

"Central to that proposition is the Australian Public Service (APS), no less than any minerals sitting in the ground, no less than any produce weaned from the land.

"The APS is an asset owned by and of enormous value to the Australian people."

In 2006, Senator Humphries famously told John Howard that he could not support the Federal Government overriding Territory legislation which legally recognised same sex relationships.

"It's a very difficult decision, Mr Acting Deputy President for a person who has been a representative of the Liberal party in two parliaments over 17 years to say that he can not for the first time agree with his colleagues," he said.

Senator Humphries crossed the floor, something he recently reflected cost him votes in his pre-selection battle.

But Senator Humphries says he was accused of not being an authentic Liberal because he crossed the floor.

"Can I take this opportunity tonight to remind my party that the ability of its members to cross the floor, to defend the primacy of their conscience and judgement, occasionally against the dictates of the Whip's call, is a practice that defines Liberalism in this country and sets it apart from the Labor Party," he said.

At 54 years of age, Senator Humphries says he is young enough to start a new career developing public policy in Canberra.
