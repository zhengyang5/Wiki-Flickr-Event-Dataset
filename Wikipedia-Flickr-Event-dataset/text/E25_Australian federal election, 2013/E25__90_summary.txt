Then voters can judge Abbott on delivery in three years or, should he prove unable to manage a democratic parliament, much sooner.
Abbott has hidden much and, as such, much must be taken on trust, just as Gillard Labor had to be taken on trust at the 2010 election.
Before the last election the Herald editorial said Abbott had not proved his case so Julia Gillard deserved a chance.
After that election produced a hung parliament, the Herald recommended Abbott be prime minister because ''stability is more likely''.
Loading Voters should not reward Labor before redemption, nor reward those who owe their influence to factions and betrayals of trust that have marked the past six years.
