Julian Assange and others from the whistleblower organisation will contest Senate seats in the coming election

The political arm of the global whistleblower organisation WikiLeaks has been formally registered by the Australian Electoral Commission in time for the federal election where the party plans to contest Senate seats in three Australian states.

The WikiLeaks party received formal registration on Tuesday and was registered under the name of Gail Malone, a member of the party's national council and described as a "peace activist" on their website. The registration lists an address in Fitzroy, Melbourne as the party's correspondence address.

Greg Barns, the WikiLeaks party campaign manager, said news of the registration meant the party would now focus on setting out key policy positions in the coming weeks. He said the party would be focused initially on the areas of climate change, refugee policy and taxation. He said these would be key policy issues should there be a balance of power following the Senate elections.

He added that the party was drawing closer to announcing who, along with Julian Assange, would contest seats for the party. He said there had been a "very high level" of interest from a number of people with a good record of "contribution to public life" asking to stand for the party.

Barns said the party planned to put forward two candidates in Western Australia and two or three candidates in both Victoria and New South Wales.

At present, Julian Assange is the only confirmed WikiLeaks party candidate. It is understood he will stand for election in Victoria. Assange remains at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he is seeking refuge to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over sexual assault allegations. Assange denies the allegations.
