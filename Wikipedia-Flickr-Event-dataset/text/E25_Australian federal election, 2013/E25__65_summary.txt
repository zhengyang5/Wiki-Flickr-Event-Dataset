THE next five weeks will be a crucial time for the Federal Government, after independent MP Andrew Wilkie warned Labor could struggle to survive an impending vote of no confidence when parliament resumes in May.
After a dramatic week in politics, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott tried to push through a vote of no confidence in the government on Thursday.
The Labor Government held off the vote on Thursday on the basis of just two votes, with key independents Mr Wilkie, Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor voting to allow the debate on such a vote.
While he had not yet decided whether would actually vote to bring down the government, Mr Wilkie spoke to the Seven Network on the issue on Saturday.
He said the government would struggle to survive the vote if it did not start showing stability and competence.
