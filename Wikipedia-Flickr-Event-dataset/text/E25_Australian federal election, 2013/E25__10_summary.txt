The man behind the controversial success of the Australian Motoring Enthusiast party and the Australian Sports party at last weekend’s election has called for reforms to how parties are registered to make sure only “real parties” are able to stand.
Ricky Muir of the Motoring Enthusiast party looks set to win the sixth Senate spot in Victoria, while Wayne Dropulich of the Sports party seems likely to gain the fifth Senate spot in Western Australia.
Glenn Druery, the political consultant known as the “preference whisperer”, has been given the credit – or the blame – for the parties’ success, for his role advising minor parties to make a series of preference deals.
He said he was surprised by the success of the Motoring Enthusiast party and the Sports party as they came to his alliance so late they did not attend any of the meetings.
He says when he saw the group voting tickets he knew immediately the Motoring Enthusiast and Sports parties had a strong chance of gaining Senate seats.
