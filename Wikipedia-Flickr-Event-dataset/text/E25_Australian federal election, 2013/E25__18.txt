If the election will be close, the Senate election will be even closer. There are 54 parties registered to contest this poll - and the Senate ballot paper will be huge.

To name a few, Bob Katter's Australian Party, the Palmer United Party, WikiLeaks Party, Smokers' Rights Party and No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics will compete for millions of voters for whom both main parties are a turn-off.

And, in pitching its asylum seeker policy to win votes back from the Coalition, Labor abandoned ground to the Greens, who hope to match, or even improve on, the six seats they won in 2010.

The outcome in every state will be decided by preference deals negotiated by those 54 parties.

They can lead to amazing results, such as Family First's Steve Fielding winning a seat in Victoria in 2004 with just 1.9 per cent of votes, then losing it in 2010 to the DLP's John Madigan, who had 2.3 per cent.

This is an election for half the Senate. The half we elected in 2010 will continue.
