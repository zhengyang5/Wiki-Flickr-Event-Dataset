Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott announce they are quitting politicsUpdatedTwo key independent MPs whose support helped Labor form government in the hung parliament after the 2010 election have announced their resignations from politics.
Member for New England Tony Windsor and the Member for Lyne, Rob Oakeshott, will not contest the next election.
Flanked by his wife and daughter, a teary Mr Windsor says he has a health issue that is currently being looked at.
But Mr Windsor says Mr Rudd could not take his vote for granted.
"I think it's just a tragedy that we found that as an issue to create fear out in the community," Mr Windsor said.
