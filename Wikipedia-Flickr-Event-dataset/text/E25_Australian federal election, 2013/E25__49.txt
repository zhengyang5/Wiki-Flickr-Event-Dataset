Liberal Member for Durack Announces Retirement

Today I announce my decision to withdraw my nomination for re-election as the Liberal member for the seat of Durack at the forthcoming Federal election.

Since 1998 I have represented firstly the electorate of Kalgoorlie and from 2010, the electorate of Durack.

It has been a pleasure and a privilege to have the opportunity to represent people from Esperance to Kununurra and I thank them for entrusting me with the responsibility of representing them.

In announcing my retirement after 15 years of service, I trust the soon to be selected Liberal candidate for the seat of Durack will enjoy the same solid support I have received.

The September Federal election will give Durack residents the opportunity to contribute to getting Australia back on track.

The elected Liberal member for Durack will be part of the team that will provide hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians.
