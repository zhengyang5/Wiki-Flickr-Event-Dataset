The strategist behind the likely surprise election to the Senate of three minor party candidates, Glenn Druery, owns a lobbying firm selling itself to business as able to ''build a productive working relationship with Independent and minor party MPs''.
The dual roles mean Mr Druery could be lobbying senators he helped get elected on Saturday - from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, Australian Sports Party and Family First - on behalf of private sector clients.
A loophole in the rules also means neither Mr Druery nor his firm Independent Liaison is required to register as a lobbyist with the Federal Parliament because the firm says it does not lobby government representatives, only non-government politicians.
Independent Liaison's website states Mr Druery ''advises businesses and organisations on how to have the most effective and productive working relationships with Independent MPs and minor parties around the country.
He continues to work closely with those MPs on their campaigns.''
