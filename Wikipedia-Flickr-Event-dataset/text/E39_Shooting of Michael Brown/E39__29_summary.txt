Al Sharpton, preaching at Brown’s funeral two weeks later, said the teen was left in the street “like nobody cared,” as if his life “didn’t matter.” A national magazine, too, zeroed in on the four hours Brown’s body lay on the ground.
About 12:05 p.m., that same ambulance, infant in the back, came across Brown’s body in the road, said two ambulance administrators.
When the paramedic determined Brown was dead, the care of his body legally transferred to the St. Louis County Medical Examiner.
Whitaker, 42, said he has transported hundreds of bodies over the years under contract with the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County.
He estimated it took him no more than 15 minutes to drive Brown’s body the five-mile trip to the morgue.
