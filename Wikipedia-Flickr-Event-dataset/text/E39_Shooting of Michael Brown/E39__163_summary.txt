After meeting at the White House Monday with his Cabinet, civil rights leaders and law enforcement officials, Obama announced spending proposals of more than $260 million for police forces across the U.S.
Protests have continued in Ferguson and elsewhere since a grand jury's decision last week not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.
The president also announced he will set up a task force to study how to improve policing.
Obama said federal programs that provide military-style equipment to local police departments must be more accountable, but he did not say whether the programs would be pulled back.
Since August, roughly 300 people have been arrested in Ferguson-related protests, which have been marred by looting and arson attacks.
