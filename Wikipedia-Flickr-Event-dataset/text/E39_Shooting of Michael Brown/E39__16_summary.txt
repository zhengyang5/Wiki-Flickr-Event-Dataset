At the time, Wilson didn’t understand what had triggered her death, but he now thinks that it might have been suicide.
Wilson, who had recently married a college student named Ashley Brown, didn’t have to look far to find a new job.
“Once you learn, though, you’ll never forget.” Wilson told the grand jury that Brown, upon being shot, had “the most intense, aggressive face,” and looked “like a demon.” Brown retreated, running east.
At one point, Wilson told investigators, Brown put his right hand into his waistband, as if reaching for a weapon.
“After I got shot at, I had one thing on my mind, and that was getting that son of a bitch,” McCarthy told me.
