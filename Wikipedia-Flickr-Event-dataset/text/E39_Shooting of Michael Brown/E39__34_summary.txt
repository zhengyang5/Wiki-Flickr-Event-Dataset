Forty FBI agents have arrived in Ferguson, Missouri to investigate the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson announced Saturday.
According to Johnson, who is currently in charge of security in Ferguson, the agents were already canvassing the neighborhood where Brown was killed, seeking eyewitnesses to the killing and other evidence.
The FBI also handed out cards requesting information from local residents, which could be filled out and returned to investigators directly, or to members of the local clergy.
In a statement emailed to the local CBS affiliate on Friday, the DOJ confirmed that attorneys from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division and the US Attorney's Office were also participating in the federal civil rights investigation.
