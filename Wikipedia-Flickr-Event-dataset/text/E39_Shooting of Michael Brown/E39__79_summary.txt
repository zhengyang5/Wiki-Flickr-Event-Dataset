The purported audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., reflects 10 shots all taken from the same place, according to acoustic experts who specialize in helping police identify urban gunshots.
When the purported recording was revealed earlier this week, the experts analyzed it, said Ralph Clark, chief executive officer of SST.
ShotSpotter acoustic experts determined that the purported recording of the Michael Brown shooting has 10 gunshots marked in red, and seven echoes, marked in yellow.
Experts said the shooter did not move, and the company could confirm the validity of the recording location if it is revealed.
At this time, the location of the recording has not been revealed, nor the precise location of the shooting that took place Aug. 9.
