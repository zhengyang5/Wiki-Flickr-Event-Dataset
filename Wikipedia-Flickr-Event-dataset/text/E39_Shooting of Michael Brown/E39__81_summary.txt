The shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month by police officer Darren Wilson has sent shockwaves through the nation's political and law-enforcement establishments.
Most agree that there was a verbal exchange on the street followed by a scuffle between Brown and Wilson, with Brown outside the car leaning in, or being pulled in.
Wilson then got out of his car and fired at Brown, who stopped and turned to face the officer.
According to her account, Brown and his friend then fled and were pursued by Wilson, and asked to stop.
However, another witness, Michael Brady, 32, who lives on the street where the incident took place, contradicted the claim that Brown had charged at Wilson.
