The evening descended into chaos after 18 year-old Tyrone Harris was shot by police when he allegedly opened fire on them.
The St Louis County Police Department said the footage, lasting 13 seconds, showed Harris pulling a gun after shots were fired.
The video depicts a young man in a white T-shirt pulling a weapon after the crowd he is in runs for cover.
The teenager was transferred to the Barnes Jewish hospital in St Louis and was described on Monday as in a critical condition.
Asked for a further update on Tuesday, a spokesman for the hospital referred inquiries to St Louis county police, where Officer Shawn McGuire said Harris remained critical.
