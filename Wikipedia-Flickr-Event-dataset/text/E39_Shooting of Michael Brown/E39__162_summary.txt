The federal government will spend $75 million on body cameras for law enforcement nationwide, in the wake of the deadly shooting of an unarmed teen in Ferguson, Missouri.
The funds — part of a three-year installment of $263 million expected to be announced soon by President Barack Obama — will match local police force purchases of cameras at 50%.
The initiative will also better implement federally funded police equipment while training officers on how to properly use it.
The announcement comes as Obama hosted a variety of civil rights, youth, community, faith, and police leaders in the Oval Office on Monday to discuss the lessons of Ferguson, the White House told reporters.
In addition, ACLU legislative director Laura Murphy will be among a group of civil rights leaders meeting with the president to discuss Ferguson, according to Diana Scholl, an ACLU spokeswoman.
