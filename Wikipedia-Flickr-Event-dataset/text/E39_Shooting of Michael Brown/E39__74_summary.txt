NBC News has obtained the recording but cannot independently verify that the sounds on it are linked to the Brown shooting, and the FBI had no comment.
Autopsy reports say that Brown was shot at least six times, but up to 11 shots are heard on the recording.
It's not clear why there was a pause in the middle, and the recording only contains 12 seconds of audio.
