ST. LOUIS COUNTY – All costs are covered for 18-year-old – All costs are covered for 18-year-old Michael Brown's funeral on Monday.

On Friday, NewsChannel 5 got a chance to talk to Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church, which will host the funeral. They say it's a big job, but they're taking it one step at a time.

The north city church has spent a lot of its time coordinating with media about how to cover the funeral. It's a public service, but they think they will be able to handle it.

"It just means that the community is welcome to support the family and be a part of the services. We have opened it up. We are willing and open to accommodate," said Denise Mackey, special events project manager.

The main sanctuary to the church seats 2,500 people. They also have two overflow sections that seat collectively around 2,000 people. For people who are at locations outside of the main sanctuary, a livestream of the funeral will be available.
