Michael Brown, the 18-year-old killed by police in Ferguson, Mo., on Aug. 9, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the New York Times reported.
The findings came Sunday after a preliminary private autopsy, the second performed on Brown, by Michael M. Baden, former chief medical officer for the state of New York, at the request of the Brown family.
“This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” he said, indicating a wound at the top of Brown’s head.
A lawyer for the Brown family said the autopsy results support the claim that the killing was unjustified.
On Sunday, U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder ordered a third autopsy performed.
