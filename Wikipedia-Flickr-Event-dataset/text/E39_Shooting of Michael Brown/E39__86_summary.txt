“Early on, I decided that anyone who claimed to have witnessed anything would be presented to the grand jury,” he said.
The Smoking Gun alleged that McElroy’s testimony to the grand jury was also fabricated.
“I believe there is a clear preponderance of evidence,” William Bastone, the editor of The Smoking Gun, told the Guardian.
The Smoking Gun reported that McElroy often posted online about the case after Michael Brown’s shooting, but before “Witness 40” went to the police with her story.
The Smoking Gun also reported that McElroy had previously been accused of lying about her involvement with a high-profile kidnapping case in St Louis.
