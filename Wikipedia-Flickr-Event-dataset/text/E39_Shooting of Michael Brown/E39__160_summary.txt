"Realistically speaking, Darren will never be a police officer again, and he understands that," attorney Jim Towey said.
There were violent protests this week in the St. Louis suburb after a grand jury declined to indict Wilson in Brownâ€™s death on Aug. 9.
Other witnesses claimed the unarmed teen had his hands up when he was shot.
Wilson has received death threats in the aftermath of the shooting, Neil Bruntrager, another of Wilson's attorneys, said.
He believes that if he ever went back to a department, he would put other officers at risk," Bruntrager said.
