FERGUSON, Mo. – Friday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents and images pertaining to a strong-arm robbery that happened shortly before shooting of Michael Brown.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch gave the following definition for strong-arm robbery:

"The use of physical force in a robbery. If someone is stealing, and another person makes an attempt to stop them, and then physical force is used to complete the act that is strong-arm robbery.

It's also called 'robbery in the 2nd degree,' and there is no weapon other than physical force used.

If a weapon is used in a robbery, then the charge would be 'robbery in the 1st degree.'"
