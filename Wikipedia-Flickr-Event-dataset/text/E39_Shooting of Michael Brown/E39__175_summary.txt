Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports"Hands Up, Don't Shoot" is not just about Mike Brown, or Ferguson,or police shooting unarmed black people.
"Hands Up, Don't Shoot" is about a fundamental question that gets to the core of what this country stands for.
As Ta-Nehisi Coates has tirelessly documented, the black community does, in fact, protest black on black crime.
A better question might be: Why does the media not report the drastic decrease in black on black crime in the past 20 years?
Or, where are the protests for white on white crime, when it happens at almost an identical rate to black on black crime?
