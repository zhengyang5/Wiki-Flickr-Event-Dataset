Credit CNN for self-auditing: On this morning’s “New Day,” co-host Michaela Pereira interviewed two law enforcement experts who expressed strong doubts about the authenticity of a purported audiotape of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown Jr. on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Mo.
Lopa Blumenthal of Blumenthal & Blumenthal in Hazelwood, Mo., says she stumbled into knowledge of the recording via a “former client” who is the roommate of the recorder.
Above the sound of the shots in the tape, he can be heard saying this to someone whom Blumenthal identifies only as a “girl”: “You are pretty.
You’re so fine, just going over some of your videos.
How could I forget?”It all sounds terribly awkward and strained.
