On NBC's Meet the Press this morning, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (D) told Andrea Mitchell that it was a huge mistake for the surveillance video of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store to be released.
And secondarily, it did put the community, and quite frankly, the region and the nation, you know, on alert again.
He then went on to describe various actions they've taken in response and assured that his perspective has been made known to the various parties involved.
As was reported by IJReview yesterday, the Obama administration did not want the video released either.
Should the video of the convenience store robbery, which certainly changes some perspectives on the victim, have been released?
