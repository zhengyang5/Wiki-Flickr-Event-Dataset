The testimony

Wilson said that he considered pulling his mace from his belt but that he couldn’t reach it. He said he pushed Brown away with his left hand and pulled his pistol from his holster. “Stop or I will shoot,” Wilson said he yelled. Johnson said he heard roughly the same thing. Wilson said he raised his gun and Brown grabbed his weapon and said, “You’re too much of a pussy to shoot me.” Johnson said he heard “cuss words from both of them,” but he said he never saw Brown touch the weapon.
