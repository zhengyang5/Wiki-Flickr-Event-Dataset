As a St. Louis County grand jury weighs whether to indict Ferguson, Mo.
police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, a series of leaks have provided new information about the skirmish that led to Brown’s death and ignited a national debate about race and police violence.
According to Wilson, Brown then ran away from the vehicle, so the officer jumped out to give chase.
Apart from detailed forensic information about Brown’s wounds, the autopsy includes a toxicology report indicating the presence of marijuana in Brown’s system.
The grand jury process has been unusual in a number of ways, as TIME reported last month.
