Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson testified that he and Michael Brown were fighting over his handgun.
Wilson told the grand jury that he pulled the trigger twice in his own defense, but no shots went off.
They told their accounts either directly to grand jurors or to FBI interviewers, whose recordings were played for the jury.
“I saw Michael punching a couple times through the window.”Wilson testified that at that moment, he was thinking: “What do I do not to get beaten inside my car?”“I drew my gun,” Wilson told the grand jury.
Wilson testified that Brown then reversed course and approached him.
