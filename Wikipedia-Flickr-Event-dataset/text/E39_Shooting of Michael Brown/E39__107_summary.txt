The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.
It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.
The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm.
This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.
Let us continue to pray for Michael Brownâ€™s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.
