Supporters have created dueling donation pages for Michael Brown, the 18-year-old gunned down in Ferguson, Mo., and for police Officer Darren Wilson, who shot the teen dead 12 days ago.
Supporters of Wilson who joined Wednesday’s protest in Ferguson were angrily met by several demonstrators, including at least one who was arrested.

“Stay strong Officer Wilson.”On the Brown page, created by family attorney Benjamin L. Crump’s office, nearly 5,000 people gave money to help the teen's kin.
