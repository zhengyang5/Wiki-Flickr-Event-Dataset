After killing Michael Brown, Officer Darren Wilson was seen in the emergency department at Christian Hospital in St. Louis. Some just-released photos taken at the time documented the extent of Wilson's injuries. The images were later presented as evidence to the grand jury. Wilson testified that Brown punched him in the face, in addition to grappling with him for control of the officer's handgun. Wilson's medical record from the emergency department culminates with the diagnosis of "facial contusion" (a bruise).

X-rays of Wilson's mandible were also obtained, and they showed no underlying fractures.

In the transcript from Wilson's testimony before the grand jury, the officer described his rationale for pulling his weapon on the unarmed Brown: "I felt another one of those punches in my face would knock me out or worse. I mean, it was, he's obviously bigger than I was, and stronger, and the—I've already taken two to the face, and I don't think I would—the third one could be fatal if he hit me right."
