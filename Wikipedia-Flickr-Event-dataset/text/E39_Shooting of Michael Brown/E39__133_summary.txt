The deceased became belligerent towards Officer Wilson.
"As Officer Wilson attempted to exit out of his patrol vehicle, the deceased pushed his door shut and began to struggle with Officer Wilson, during the struggle the officer's weapon was un-holstered.
As he was giving chase to the deceased, the deceased turned around and ran towards Officer Wilson.
"Officer Wilson had his service weapon drawn, as the deceased began to run towards him, he discharged his service weapon several times."
"Several independent witnesses indicated there was a brief altercation between Michael Brown and Officer Wilson at the patrol car," Crump said.
