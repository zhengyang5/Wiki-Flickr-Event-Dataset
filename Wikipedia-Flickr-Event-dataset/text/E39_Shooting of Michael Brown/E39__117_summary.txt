Officer Wilson, who is white, has been placed on leave, and his location is unknown.
Mr. Johnson has admitted being in the convenience store with Mr. Brown and told investigators from the F.B.I.
and St. Louis County that Mr. Brown did “take cigarillos,” Mr. Johnson’s lawyer, Freeman Bosley Jr., a former mayor of St. Louis, told MSNBC.
In his afternoon appearance, Chief Jackson sought to explain why the information was released on Friday.
Any suggestion that Officer Wilson sought out Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnson because they were robbery suspects, however, was dispelled by the police chief at the afternoon news conference.
