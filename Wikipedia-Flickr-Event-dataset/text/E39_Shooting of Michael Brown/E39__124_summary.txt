Speakers kept the spotlight on the fatal shooting Aug. 9 of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, by a white police officer in nearby Ferguson.
Victoria Ryan-Bailey, 59, of St. Louis, walked the festival holding a poster that said, "Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death."
"This unrest is a result of conditions that exist not just in St. Louis but throughout America," she said.
Michael Brown Sr. made a brief appearance.
