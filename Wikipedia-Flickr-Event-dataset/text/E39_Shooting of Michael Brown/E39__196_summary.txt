-- Ferguson's first black police chief is taking over as the St. Louis County town introduces reforms intended to address concerns about racial bias.
Veteran officer Delrish Moss will be sworn in Monday afternoon.
He hopes to make the force more reflective of the community it protects and serves, reports CBS affiliate KMOV.
A judge last month approved Ferguson's settlement with the U.S. Justice Department to amend the municipal code, eliminate bias and reform the courts and police department.
He replaces Tom Jackson, who resigned in March 2015 following a Justice Department report critical of Ferguson's criminal justice system.
