"That is a degree that does not exist in my knowledge, except in the mind of Shawn Parcells,” Dr. Mitchell said.
Dr. Mitchell takes issue with Parcells’ title.
That was under Dr. Young," Parcells said.
Parcells says his training began in 1997 when he interned with Dr. Young, until he was hired in the mid-2000's.
He has experience as a morgue technician, somebody who would move bodies around, clean up after an autopsy,” Dr. Mitchell said.
