Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson discussed his account of the moment he shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown in an exclusive interview with ABC News.
“I started backpedaling, ‘cause he’s just getting too close and he’s not stopping,” Wilson told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos.
And as he does that, he kinda starts to lean forward like he’s gonna tackle me.
If he’s gonna tackle me, he’s gonna tackle me at that point.
The first person, Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, ignored Wilson, the officer said.
