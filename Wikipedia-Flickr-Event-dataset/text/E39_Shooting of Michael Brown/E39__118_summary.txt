"It's clear the Ferguson chief is overwhelmed by the magnitude of this incident," said Daniel Isom II, a retired St. Louis police chief who now teaches at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
While working for St. Louis County, he led a drug task force and was also a SWAT team supervisor, airplane and helicopter instructor pilot, undercover detective and hostage negotiator.
Since the Aug. 9 shooting, the Ferguson chief has continually spoken of a desire to work with community members.
After the shooting, Jackson asked county police to take the lead in both the investigation of the shooting and in crowd control at the protests.
Ronald Johnson said that he was not told ahead of time that Jackson would release the Ferguson officer's name or the information about Brown as a robbery suspect.
