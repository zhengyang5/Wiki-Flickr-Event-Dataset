The St. Louis Police Department condemned St. Louis Rams football players who ran onto the field Sunday night with their arms raised in the “hands-up, don’t shoot” pose.
“The St. Louis Police Officers Association is profoundly disappointed with the members of the St. Louis Rams football team who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week and engage in a display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive, and inflammatory,” the police said in a statement.
Jeff Roorda, the business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, was especially incensed by the Rams, noting that the team and the NFL depended on the police to keep fans safe from violent protesters.
It’s cops and the good people of St. Louis and other NFL towns that do.
If it’s not the NFL and the Rams, then it’ll be cops and their supporters.”A spokesman for the St. Louis Rams told KSDK.com that the team did not know about the demonstration beforehand.
