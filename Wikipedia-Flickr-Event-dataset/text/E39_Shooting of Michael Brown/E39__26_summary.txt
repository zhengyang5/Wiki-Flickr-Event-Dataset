The paper's analysis of police reports, radio calls, interviews and EMS records found that the altercation between Brown and Officer Darren Wilson unfolded in less than one minute and 30 seconds.
Just before his encounter with Brown, Wilson had reportedly responded to a call for assistance with a 2-month-old child who had been having trouble breathing.
According to unnamed sources, Wilson told authorities that he had addressed the pair and told them to get out of the middle of the street.
The FBI is investigating Brown's shooting and will determine if it abused federal civil rights laws.
A grand jury is currently deciding whether or not Wilson will be indicted for shooting Brown; a decision is expected by the end of November.
