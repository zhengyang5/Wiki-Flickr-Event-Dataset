The officer who fatally gunned down Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., described to the grand jury how the unarmed teen overpowered and taunted him.
“I drew my gun,” Officer Darren Wilson recalled.
They proceeded to struggle over the weapon and Wilson — who is 6 feet 4 — said he was overmatched.
But then Brown charged at him and the officer fired repeatedly, he said — describing how he fired the fatal shot to Brown’s head as Brown continued to charge him.
“It went into him, the demeanor on his face went blank, the aggression was gone.”State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson by New York Post
