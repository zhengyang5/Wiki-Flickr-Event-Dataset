Williams is accused of shooting the two officers Thursday outside Ferguson's police station, which has been the scene of protests since last summer's fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.
"This wasn't any type of ambush shooting," Christmas said in an interview with the AP, countering an earlier description by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar of the March 12 shooting outside Ferguson police headquarters.
But that assertion was met with skepticism by St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch.
According to 2014 county court records, Williams lived in the nearby community of Jennings, which borders Ferguson.
A 41-year-old St. Louis County officer was shot in the right shoulder, the bullet exiting through his back.
