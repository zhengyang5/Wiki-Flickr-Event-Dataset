In addition, Brown had marijuana in his system when he was shot and killed by a police officer on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, according to this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.
The report from Case’s office was released to the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office on Friday night but has not been made public.
This report is part of the county’s official investigation into the shooting, but it is one of three autopsies being conducted.
