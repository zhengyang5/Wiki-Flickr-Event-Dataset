On NBC's Meet the Press this morning, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (D) told Andrea Mitchell that it was a huge mistake for the surveillance video of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store to be released.

Responding to a question about whether the video release was justified, given that no details about the shooting itself have been released, he said:

Yeah, we and our security team,and the highway patrol did not know that was going to be released. I don't think the attorney general knew that. And quite frankly, we disagree deeply. I think for two reasons: Number one, to attempt to in essence disparage the character of this victim in the middle of a process like this is not right. It's just not right. And secondarily, it did put the community, and quite frankly, the region and the nation, you know, on alert again. These are old wounds. These are deep wounds in these communities, and that action was not helpful.

He then went on to describe various actions they've taken in response and assured that his perspective has been made known to the various parties involved. As was reported by IJReview yesterday, the Obama administration did not want the video released either.

Do you agree? Should the video of the convenience store robbery, which certainly changes some perspectives on the victim, have been released? Or is it essential background information, considering how there are claims the officer involved in the fatal incident was in a violent altercation with Brown prior to the shooting?
