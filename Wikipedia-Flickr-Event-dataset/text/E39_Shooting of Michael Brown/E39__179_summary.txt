[theplatform account=”4uMbOC” media=”bizDm7Y477pG” player=”Ud34RrXnH_qf”]Two uniformed NYPD officers were shot dead Saturday afternoon as they sat in their marked police car on a Brooklyn street corner — in what investigators believe was a crazed gunman’s ­assassination-style mission to avenge Eric Garner and Michael Brown.
Moments after killing the two officers, Brinsley, too, was dead, having turned his gun on himself on a nearby subway platform as cops closed in.
Brinsley walked up to the cops’ patrol car at the corner of Myrtle and Tompkins avenues, approaching from the sidewalk.
“I heard shooting, four or five shots,” witness Derrick McKie, 49, told The Post of the cops’ tragic murder.
His body was lifeless.”Carmen Jimenez, 32, a social worker from Bed-Stuy, was on the subway platform when the gunman ran in, pursued by cops.
