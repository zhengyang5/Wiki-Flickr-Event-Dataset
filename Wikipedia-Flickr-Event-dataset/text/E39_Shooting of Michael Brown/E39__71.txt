The third and fi­nal autopsy con­duc­ted on Mi­chael Brown, the Fer­guson, Mo. teen who was shot and killed by a po­lice of­ficer in the St. Louis sub­urb on Aug. 9. The autopsy, like the two re­leased after a grand jury de­cided not to in­dict Of­ficer Dar­ren Wilson, shows Brown was shot eight times, but only once at close range.
