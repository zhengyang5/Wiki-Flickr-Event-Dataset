One of the bullets shattered Mr. Brown’s right eye, traveled through his face, exited his jaw and re-entered his collarbone.
Mr. Brown, he said, would not have survived the shooting even if he had been taken to a hospital right away.
It is about a 10-minute walk from Ferguson Market to the spot where Officer Wilson, 28, with six years’ experience, approached Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnson.
While he and Mr. Brown walked, he said, Officer Wilson stopped his vehicle and told them to get on the sidewalk.
With his left hand, Officer Wilson reached out and grabbed Mr. Brown by the neck, Mr. Johnson said.
