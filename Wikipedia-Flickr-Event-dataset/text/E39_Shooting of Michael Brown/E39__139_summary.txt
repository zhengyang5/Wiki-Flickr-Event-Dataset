The department of Justice announced today that police officer Darren Wilson will not be charged in the death of Michael Brown.
According to the report, Wilson "saw Brown reach his right hand under his t-shirt into what appeared to be his waistband."
The Justice Department also released its investigation of the Ferguson police, which found a pattern and practice of discriminatory policing.
In its review, the Justice Department found 161 use of force complaints against the Ferguson police from 2010 to 2014.
With its findings now public, the Justice Department is likely to seek agreement from the Ferguson police department to implement serious changes to its practices.
