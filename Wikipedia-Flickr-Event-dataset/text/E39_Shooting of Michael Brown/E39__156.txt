FERGUSON, Mo. – After a grand jury decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting unarmed teen Michael Brown, Brown’s stepfather, in a now-infamous scene, stood above a crowd and repeatedly screamed, "Burn this bitch down." Police are now investigating whether those were the cries of a hurting man, or words intended to incite a riot.

America Tonight's cameras also caught those heated moments up close. And before Louis Head climbed onto the car, before he comforted his distraught wife and yelled to the gathered throngs, he seemed to reply to an unidentified man in the crowd with the statement: "If I get up there, I'm gonna start a riot. Burn this bitch down."

For the first time, we're publishing the two key minutes of America Tonight's raw footage. He makes that specific comment at the 16-second mark.
