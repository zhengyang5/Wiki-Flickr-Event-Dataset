Brown family via AP Michael Brown’s shooting death at the hands of a police officer has brought national attention to the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo.
Brown died last week in a confrontation with a police officer in this suburb of St. Louis.
The two medical experts conducted the four-hour examination Sunday at the Austin A. Layne Mortuary in St. Louis.
On the day he died, he was wearing a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap, long khaki shorts and flip-flops with yellow socks.
“There was at least one shot fired in the car.”At that point, the police said, Wilson left his vehicle and fatally shot Brown.
