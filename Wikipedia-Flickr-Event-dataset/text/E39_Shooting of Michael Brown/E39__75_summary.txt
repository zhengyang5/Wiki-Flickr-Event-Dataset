Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown," the company said.
The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the Brown shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.
Police say Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were blocking traffic.
Johnson said Wilson shot Brown again as the teen ran away.
But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.
