Among the other information released Monday was the federal autopsy, which matches two other autopsies released earlier â€“ one performed by local officials, the other at the behest of the family. Brown was shot eight times, at least once at close range, and suffered other abrasions to his face, the autopsy found. It also found, like the other autopsies, that marijuana was present in Brown's system.
