Egypt has backed the United Nation’s call for the United States authorities to deal with protests in Ferguson, Missouri “according to the American and international standards”.

A spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, in response to a question from state-run news agency MENA, said the ministry is “following the escalation of protests and demonstrations in the city of Ferguson and reactions thereto”.

The spokesman referred to comments made by UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon on Monday as a reflection of the “international community’s position towards these events” including the calls for “restraint and respect for the right of assembly and peaceful expression of opinion”.

Ban also said he hoped investigations into the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown will “shed full light on the killing and that justice will be done.”

Demonstrations in Ferguson began after Brown, who was unarmed, was shot dead by a policeman. Autopsy reports showed that the teen was shot six times. Protests have escalated with incidents of looting and police forces have responded by firing tear gas.

The US Department of State has in the past repeatedly called on Egyptian authorities to respect freedom of assembly and expression.

Last week Human Rights Watch released a report saying that Egyptian security forces’ clearing of a two protest camps “probably amounts to crimes against humanity”, saying at least 817 people were killed.
