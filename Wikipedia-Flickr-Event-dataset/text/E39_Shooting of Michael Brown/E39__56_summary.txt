After the official autopsy on Michael Brown was leaked to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in October, details of the autopsy seemed to be partially misconstrued, according to outside experts commissioned by the newspaper to review the report.
The St. Louis County medical examiner’s autopsy report indicated that 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot in the hand at close range during an altercation with Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson.
Forensic pathologist Judy Melinek and St. Louis city medical examiner Michael Graham reviewed the county’s report for The Post-Dispatch.
The killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed, black 18-year-old, by a white police officer has thrown the town of Ferguson, Missouri into weeks of unrest.
The county’s report was not meant to be released until after a grand jury decided whether to criminally try Wilson for Brown’s death.
