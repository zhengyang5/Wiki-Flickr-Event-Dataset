He will likely be one of the final voices the grand jury hears before making a decision.
Dr. Baden came to St. Louis from New York to perform a private autopsy on the body of Michael Brown back in August.
Dr. Baden didn’t have access to Micheal Brown’s clothing at the time of the autopsy and the body may have been washed after the first autopsy.
the prosecuting attorney’s office declined to comment on whether Doctor Baden will testify in front of the grand jury.
