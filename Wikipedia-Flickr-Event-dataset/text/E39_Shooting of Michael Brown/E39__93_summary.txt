But no clear picture of what truly transpired emerges from thousands of pages of grand jury testimony released this week by St. Louis County prosecutors.
An undated evidence photograph made available by the St. Louis County prosecutors office shows the cap that Michael Brown was wearing when he was shot to death by police officer Darren Wilson.
“The officer unloaded on him,” another witness told the grand jury.
The grand jury transcripts show prosecutors, who led the inquiry, grilling eyewitnesses, testing their memories and asking for minute details.
One witness described Brown facing the officer on his knees and had previously said he heard Brown pleading for his life.
