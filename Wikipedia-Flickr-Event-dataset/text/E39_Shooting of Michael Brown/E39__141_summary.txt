Egypt has backed the United Nation’s call for the United States authorities to deal with protests in Ferguson, Missouri “according to the American and international standards”.
A spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, in response to a question from state-run news agency MENA, said the ministry is “following the escalation of protests and demonstrations in the city of Ferguson and reactions thereto”.
Protests have escalated with incidents of looting and police forces have responded by firing tear gas.
The US Department of State has in the past repeatedly called on Egyptian authorities to respect freedom of assembly and expression.
Last week Human Rights Watch released a report saying that Egyptian security forces’ clearing of a two protest camps “probably amounts to crimes against humanity”, saying at least 817 people were killed.
