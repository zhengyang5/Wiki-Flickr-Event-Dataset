Ferguson City Attorney Stephanie Karr makes Statement on FOI RequestsFerguson, Missouri â€“ September 5th, 2014 - Within days of the tragic events on August 9, the City of Ferguson began receiving multiple requests for information and documents.
City personnel cataloged all requests and treated them in the same manner as it would any Sunshine Law request.
The Sunshine Law dictates that Governmental entities must respond to both general requests and specific requests and release all documents that are responsive to the those requests, unless those documents are otherwise closed.
Under the Sunshine Law, the police department had no reason to close these records and withhold them from the public.
By the date of August 15, the City having reached its statutory deadline to respond to the information requests, released the store robbery reports, including the surveillance video.
