In sending Wilson’s case to the grand jury, McCulloch technically turned over to them the decision about whether to prosecute.
By submitting all the evidence to the grand jury, he added to the perception that this process represented an independent evaluation of the evidence.
The grand jury chose not to indict Wilson for any crimes in connection with Brown’s death.
In making the case for Wilson’s innocence, McCulloch cherry-picked the most exculpatory information from what was assembled before the grand jury.
Buried underneath every scrap of evidence McCulloch could find, the grand jury threw up its hands and said that a crime could not be proved.
