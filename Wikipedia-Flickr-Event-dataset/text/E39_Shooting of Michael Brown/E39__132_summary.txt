Further compounding Wilson's version of events was the revelation that Brown had marijuana in his system when he was shot.
The police also say Brown had marijuana on him at the time of his fatal run-in with Officer Wilson.
In the statement Wilson told how Brown grabbed at the pistol and continued to hit him in the face.
In his account, Wilson then described firing a second shot - which missed.
One shot, Wilson said, hit Brown's forehead and brought him down.
