The officer may have been trying to hold Garner in some other way, as he apparently testified before the grand jury.
When officer Darren Wilson, 28, encountered Brown, Brown was walking in the middle of the road, obstructing traffic.
At one point, they both had their fingers on the trigger, according to Officer Wilson.
Prosecuting attorney Robert McCullough of St. Louis County, Missouri, has been roundly criticized for not obtaining an indictment of officer Wilson.
That doesnâ€™t mean the Staten Island grand jury was racist.
