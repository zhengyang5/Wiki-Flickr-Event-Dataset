Brown's relatives immediately questioned whether the officer really believed Brown was a suspect and said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up.
Later, a lawyer for the teen's parents acknowledged that the robbery suspect in the surveillance video appeared to be Brown.
Ron Johnson, now in command of security in Ferguson, said he was not told about the convenience store video before Ferguson police released the information.
At 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting, police records show, authorities received a call reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market.
Police have determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.
