The church that will host Michael Brown's funeral says it's a big job but they're ready.
On Friday, NewsChannel 5 got a chance to talk to Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church, which will host the funeral.
The north city church has spent a lot of its time coordinating with media about how to cover the funeral.
For people who are at locations outside of the main sanctuary, a livestream of the funeral will be available.
