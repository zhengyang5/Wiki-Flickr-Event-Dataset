(Reuters) - The white police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, in August got no severance deal when he resigned from the force, the mayor of the St. Louis suburb said on Sunday.
“There will be no severance or extension of benefits for Darren Wilson following his resignation,” Mayor James Knowles told a news conference.
Anger spilled onto the playing field when the NFL’s St. Louis Rams played Oakland at home on Sunday.
The St. Louis Police Officers Association said in a statement it was “profoundly disappointed” by the act.
Al Sharpton preached on Sunday to a congregation of some 2,500 worshippers at the St. Louis church where Michael Brown’s funeral was held in August.
