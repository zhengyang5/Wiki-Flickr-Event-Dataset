Michael Brown could have survived five of the six gunshots fired at him by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, but the last shot to the top of his head killed him, a privately conducted autopsy found.
"The kill shot is right here, at the apex of his head," attorney Darrell Parks said.
"The kill shot is right here, at apex of his head, and it is a clear back-to-front position.

In addition to the two shots to the head, Brown was shot four times in the right arm and chest.
