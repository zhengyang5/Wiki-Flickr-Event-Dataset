After three months of deliberations, the grand jury declined to indict Wilson.
“I’m backpedaling pretty good because I know if he reaches me, he’ll kill me,” Wilson told grand jurors on Sept. 16, in testimony about the Aug. 9 confrontation.
The prosecutor said the grand jury heard testimony from numerous witnesses including three medical examiners, and experts on blood, DNA, toxicology, firearms and drug analysis.
“Everybody knows why we’re here, so let’s just get to it,” deputy prosecutor Sheila Whirley told Wilson, when he gave his sworn testimony.
“And that’s when it clicked for me,” he told the grand jury.
