In the neighborhood around the worn Canfield Green Apartments, 18-year-old Michael Brown was known as a young man with some potential.
Calling himself Big’Mike, he was a prolific amateur rapper, recording solo and duet tracks and posting them online.
The two chatted on Facebook about Brown's growing interest and how he had spent time in a studio matching his lyrics with beats.
Many of his tracks were styled as hard-driving “trap” hip-hop, propelled by strong bass-filled beats and lyrics that tapped into familiar musical themes: money, success, drugs and sex.
But some showed Brown's more vulnerable side, as he rapped about his love for his stepmother and the manners his grandmother extolled.
