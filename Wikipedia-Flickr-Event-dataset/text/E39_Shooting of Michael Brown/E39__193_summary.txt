In the suit, Johnson says he and Brown were peacefully and lawfully walking down the street when Wilson called from his patrol car for them to "get the f**k on the sidewalk."
Then, the suit says, Wilson stopped the men "without justification and unreasonably detained [them]" before discharging his weapon, killing Brown.
The lawsuit goes on to say Wilson did not have probable cause, reasonable suspicion or legal justification to detain Johnson.
The Department of Justice released an alarming report in March that found the Ferguson Police Department responsible for unfairly targeting African-Americans for minor offenses.
Johnson’s lawsuit echoes the DOJ’s report, saying law enforcement efforts in the town focused on generating revenue rather than public safety needs.
