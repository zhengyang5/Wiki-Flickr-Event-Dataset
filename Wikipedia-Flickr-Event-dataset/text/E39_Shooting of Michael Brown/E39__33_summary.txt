Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew Saturday in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson where black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death by a white police officer a week ago.
Nixon and Johnson spoke at a church in Ferguson, where they were interrupted repeatedly by people demanding justice and objecting to the curfew.
Johnson assured those in attendance that police would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to observe the curfew.
Former St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch tweeted: "You did not see "police restraint" overnight.
St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.
