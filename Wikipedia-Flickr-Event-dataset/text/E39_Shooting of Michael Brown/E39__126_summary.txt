After killing Michael Brown, Officer Darren Wilson was seen in the emergency department at Christian Hospital in St. Louis.
Some just-released photos taken at the time documented the extent of Wilson's injuries.
Wilson testified that Brown punched him in the face, in addition to grappling with him for control of the officer's handgun.
Wilson's medical record from the emergency department culminates with the diagnosis of "facial contusion" (a bruise).
