ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) - The attorney for Michael Brown's family told FOX 2 that Dr. Michael Baden will testify before the grand jury Thursday.

Anthony Gray called the news "huge." He will likely be one of the final voices the grand jury hears before making a decision. Dr. Baden came to St. Louis from New York to perform a private autopsy on the body of Michael Brown back in August. It was requested by the Brown family.

At the time he said that he did not think any of the bullets were fired from close range because he did not find any gun powder residue on the body. That contradicts the first autopsy done by the St. Louis County Medical Examiner. Doctor Baden also said that the fatal shot to the top of Brown’s head could have struck brown while he was surrendering or well he was charging Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

Dr. Baden didn’t have access to Micheal Brown’s clothing at the time of the autopsy and the body may have been washed after the first autopsy. He admitted those things could’ve changed his findings.

the prosecuting attorney’s office declined to comment on whether Doctor Baden will testify in front of the grand jury.

Dr. Baden has testified in a lot of high profile cases. He usually charges $10,000 to perform an autopsy, but he waived that fee for the Brown family.
