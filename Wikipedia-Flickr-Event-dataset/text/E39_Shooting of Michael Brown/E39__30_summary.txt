That medical examiner, who was not named, arrived at the scene after the detective, and strangely, did not take any photographs.
He was asked, “So when you arrived [at the crime scene,] the medical examiner had not been notified?” The detective explained, “To my knowledge, no.
Sergeant [redacted] informed me that they had not been.… My main concern was making sure the medical examiner was dispatched.… If the suspect is deceased, then the next step would be to contact the medical examiner.” It’s unclear from the testimony why the sergeant did not contact the medical examiner himself.
The first medical examiner who testified described his role as the “eyes and ears of our pathologist” at the scene of the crime.
The medical examiner also did not take any measurements at the crime scene, “Because you didn’t need to?” he was asked, “Correct,” he replied.
