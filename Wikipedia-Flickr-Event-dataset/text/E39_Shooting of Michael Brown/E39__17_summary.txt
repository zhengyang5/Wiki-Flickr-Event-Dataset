A former next-door neighbor in the small city of Troy, an hour northwest of St. Louis, where Officer Wilson and his former wife lived for about a year, said he recalled Officer Wilson grilling outside from time to time and never causing trouble.
And in Crestwood, southwest of St. Louis, where records show that Officer Wilson now lives with Barbara Spradling, a fellow police officer, neighbors said they rarely made much conversation.
“My husband and I thought, ‘How did he get to be a police officer?’ ”After attending the police academy, Officer Wilson began work in Jennings, another suburb, in June 2009.
Robert Orr, the former chief of the Jennings Police Department, said he had no recollection of Officer Wilson and had to call the mayor last week to jog his memory.
Mr. Brooks was just sitting in a car in his grandmother’s driveway when Officer Wilson confronted him, his relatives say.
