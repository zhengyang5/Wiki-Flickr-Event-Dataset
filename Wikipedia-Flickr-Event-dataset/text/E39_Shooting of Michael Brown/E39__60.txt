JUDY WOODRUFF:

Protests continue in Ferguson, Missouri, 75 days after teenager Michael Brown was shot and killed by police.

The latest round last night was sparked after details from the official autopsy report of Brown conducted by the county were leaked to The Saint Louis Post-Dispatch.

Joining us now is Dr. Judy Melinek. Sheâ€™s a forensic pathologist and associate professor of Pathology at the University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center. She reviewed the autopsy for The Post-Dispatch.

Dr. Melinek, thank you very much for joining us.

So you were provided with a copy of this autopsy report. What did you take away from it? What did you learn?
