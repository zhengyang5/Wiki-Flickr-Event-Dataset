(CNN) – More than two weeks after a Saint Louis County grand jury did not indict Officer Darren Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown, there are new revelations about the evidence that drove their decision.
The grand jury had to figure out who and what to believe.
At worst it’s completely unreliable.”Thousands of pages of documents, made public, turn up several examples of testimony with little to no credibility.
Witness 22, whose testimony was at first damaging to Officer Wilson, admitted she lied when pressed by investigators.
Johnson told a nearly identical “hands up” version of what happened to county and federal authorities the grand jury and the media.
