In many ways, the chaotic situation in Ferguson, Mo., seems like something that shouldn't happen in America.
There are plenty of foreign journalists reporting on Ferguson, however, and for them, Ferguson is international news.
On Monday, state news agency Xinhua published an editorial that called America's racial problems a "deeply-rooted chronic disease."
However, as Josh Chin at the Wall Street Journal has noted, official coverage of the Ferguson riots has been muted, perhaps due to worrying parallels with situations closer to home.
Notably, the Xinhua editorial, for all its hard tone, ends with a passage criticizing the United States for its criticism of other countries.
