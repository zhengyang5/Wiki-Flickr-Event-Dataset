Police fired tear gas at a crowd of protesters late Wednesday for another night, as the group gathered to protest Brown's deadly shooting.
Police announced that they no longer considered the protest peaceful, before they fired the canisters, CNN producer Yon Pomrenze said.
On Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN that the officer had been hit and suffered swelling on the side of his face.
"Race relations is a top priority right now and, as I said, I'm working with the Department of Justice to improve that," Jackson told reporters Wednesday.
Dorian Johnson, who said he saw the shooting, told CNN on Tuesday that the officer who opened fire is white.
