Transcripts of the grand jury proceedings indicate that interview was conducted on Aug. 13, four days after the shooting, and lasted more than two hours.
Transcripts of that interview were provided to grand jurors, who then listened to a recording of it in its entirety, the records show.
McCulloch's office labeled the witness interview transcripts it released by witness number, up to Witness #64.
But only 24 different witnesses' interviews with law enforcement were included in the information released.
And yet, KSDK-TV's investigative team found that more than half of the witness interviews that were made public were conducted by FBI agents or federal prosecutors.
