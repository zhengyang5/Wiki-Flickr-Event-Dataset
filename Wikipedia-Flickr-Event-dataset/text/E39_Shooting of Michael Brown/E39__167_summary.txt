GoFundMe sites for both Officer Darren Wilson (left) and the family of shooting victim Michael Brown (right) have each raised more than $100,000.
At the same time, a page collecting donations for Michael Brown's family has raised just over $115,000 in seven days.
"We stand behind Officer Darren Wilson and his family during this trying time in their lives," the page's main message reads.
Officer Wilson deserves to tell his side of the story," wrote another donor.
The "Michael Brown Memorial Fund" page on GoFundMe appears to be run by the law firm representing Brown's family, Parks & Crump LLC.
