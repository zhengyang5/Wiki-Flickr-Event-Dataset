"In many cases, the grand jury can see evidence in a few minutes and take a vote," he said.
Trachtenberg noted that the grand jury saw evidence that helped bolster Wilson's version of events, not secure an indictment.
Wilson told the grand jury Brown punched him repeatedly, and he feared another blow would kill him or knock him out.
He accused McCulloch of defending Wilson rather than prosecuting him â€” of failing to put his "best case" before the grand jury.
