Wilson testified Brownâ€™s possession of the cigarillos was the impetus behind the encounter that ultimately led to his death.
Johnson testified he had planned to pay for the cigarillos, but Brown reached over the counter and grabbed them.
Brown walked toward the door and the store clerk rushed around the counter to prevent his exit.
Johnson testified Wilson initiated physical contact, that he never saw Brown throw a punch and that Brown was outside the police cruiser when Wilson shot him.
Wilson testified he acted in self-defense after Brown punched him and attempted to grab his gun.
