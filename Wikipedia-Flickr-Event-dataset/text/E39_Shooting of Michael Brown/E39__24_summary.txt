The accounts of why a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown on a street in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday couldn't be more disparate.
The St. Louis suburb of 21,000 was wracked by violence as protesters outraged over the 18-year-old's shooting faced off with police.
"(Brown's) body jerked as if he was hit from behind, and he turned around and he put his hands up.
Johnson said it was more than three, and Brown's mother said she was told he was shot eight times.
Meanwhile, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, didn't need to know his identity to direct some pointed words at the man who shot the son she knew as a "gentle giant."
