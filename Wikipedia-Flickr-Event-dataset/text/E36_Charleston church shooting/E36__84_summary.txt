Dylann Roof appears by closed-circuit television at his bond hearing in Charleston, South Carolina in this June 19, 2015 still image from video.
Prosecutors declined to comment afterward on whether they would accept a guilty plea from Roof, who is white and has been linked to white supremacist views.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams, who is prosecuting Roof in federal court, argued on Wednesday for keeping the documents sealed.
Media outlets asked the judge to lift his gag order, arguing that transparency ensures a defendant's right to a fair trial.
In addition to state murder charges, Roof faces 33 federal hate crime and weapons charges that also could result in a death sentence.
