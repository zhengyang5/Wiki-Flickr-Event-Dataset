The president of a far-Right organisation, which Charleston gunman Dylann Roof credited with inspiring his church shooting , has given donations to a number of Republican presidential candidates.
Since 2012, Mr Holt has contributed $8,500 to Mr Cruz, the Texas senator running for president, according to research by The Guardian .
Mr Santorum's spokesman Matthew Beynon said: "Senator Santorum does not condone or respect racist or hateful comments of any kind.
Mr Holt also gave $1,750 to Rand Paul's election fund, and he gave $2,000 to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney.
Roof, 21, who is charged with nine counts of murder, is believed to have written an online manifesto in which he said that the Council of Conservative Citizens had inspired him.
