Principle Gallery Charleston is set to unveil Sunday(May 29th) the Emanuel Nine Portrait Project to honor the victims, their families and those in the community whose lives were affected by the tragedy.

As a way to commemorate the victims from the one-year anniversary, nine artists were compelled to create a portrait tribute of each of the fallen Emanuel Member.

The artists' goals were to portray the lives of the victims, to capture their stories on canvas, and dedicate this tribute to their families with hopes to warm their hearts.

Participating artists included: Ricky Mujica, Mario Andres Robinson, Lauren Tilden, Paul McCormack, Gregory Mortenson, Catherine Prescott, Terry Strickland, Judy Takács, Stephanie Deshpande.
