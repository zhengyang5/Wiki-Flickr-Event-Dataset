Three more victims of the South Carolina church massacre are being laid to rest Saturday, drawing mourners to the scene of a tragedy that has pulled the Charleston community tighter together.

"I struggled through all these funerals because this happened on my watch. And what I can tell you is we will make this right," South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said at a joint funeral for Tywanza Sanders, 26, and Susie Jackson, 87, on Saturday afternoon. "They will not have died in vain."

The services were held at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church â€” the same house of worship where a white gunman killed Sanders, Jackson and seven others during a Bible study on June 17. Police say the shooting was racially motivated.

Cynthia Hurd, 54, was memorialized Saturday morning. Speakers at her funeral said the beloved town librarian was a dedicated public servant.

Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., one of Congress' leading black lawmakers, said Hurd embodied South Carolina's motto, a Latin phrase that translates to: "While I breathe, I hope."

"Because of the life of Cynthia Graham Hurd and eight other great people, I have hope today," Clyburn said. "I have great hope that South Carolina is going to live out its motto in a way that none of us would have ever believed."

Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson was among those who packed the church to remember Hurd along with Sanders and his great aunt, Jackson. As mourners filed into the church, many leaned over their open caskets to kiss them.

"These are lives that meant something," Jackson said.
