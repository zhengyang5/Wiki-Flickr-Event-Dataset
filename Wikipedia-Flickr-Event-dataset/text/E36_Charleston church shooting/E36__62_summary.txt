(Stephen B. Morton/Associated Press)The man accused of killing nine black parishioners in a historic Charleston, S.C., church last year “self-radicalized” online, absorbing violent white supremacist beliefs from the Internet, according to federal prosecutors.
Dylann Roof, 22, could face a death sentence in the federal case against him as well as in the state’s parallel case stemming from the shooting.
After the church attack, officials found a manifesto online belonging to Roof that was filled with racist characterizations of black people and others.
In the filing, prosecutors also said that evidence suggests that Roof’s sentiments grew in the months before the attacks.
Prosecutors seeking a federal death sentence have said that the shooting was carefully planned and racially motivated.
