CHARLESTON, S.C. — Dylann Roof has confessed to authorities to shooting and killing nine people this week at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C., two law enforcement officials said Friday.
One of the officials said that Roof, who is white, told investigators that he wanted to start a race war.
“And he said good, because we need a survivor because I’m going to kill myself,” Johnson told CNN.
“The only reason someone would walk into a church and shoot people that were praying is hate,” Charleston Mayor Riley said.
