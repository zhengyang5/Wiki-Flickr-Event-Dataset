Nine people were killed Wednesday night after a 21-year-old gunman opened fire during a Bible study at The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, where Pinckney was pastor.
Cotton said that Pinckney had voted against a concealed carry measure as a South Carolina senator, but a search of legislative archives could not immediately find any such measure.
Cotton, a former police officer in Friendswood, south of Houston, said he carries a gun into church.
He said South Carolina's concealed carry law allows permit holders to carry a gun in church if the church has given authorization.
But the law has never allowed permit holders to bring a gun into a church without such permission, he said.
