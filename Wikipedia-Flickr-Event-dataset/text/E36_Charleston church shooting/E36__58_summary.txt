The provenance of the website, which contains a cache of photographs of the 21-year-old in which he is seen holding a pistol or standing beside the Confederate flag, is unclear.
On Saturday, FBI director James Comey caused controversy when he said he did not view the Charleston shooting as an act of terror.
The website was created in February by a registrant who listed his or her name as Dylann Roof.
In four photographs Roof is either holding or surrounded by the Confederate flag, which represents the region that seceded from the Union in 1861, in defense of slavery.
“There were pages upon pages of these brutal black on white murders,” the manifesto apparently written by Roof says about the website.
