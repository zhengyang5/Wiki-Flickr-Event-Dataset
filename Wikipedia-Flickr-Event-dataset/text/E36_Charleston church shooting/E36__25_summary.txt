The Emanuel African Methodist Church is the oldest black congregation in the South.
Police responded to the shooting at roughly 9pm local time, and surrounded the Emanuel AME afterwards.
The attack on Emanuel AME cannot be divorced from the broader targeting of black bodies in the US.
Moreover, it takes place amid a broader context of both public and private violence against black American communities, which spawned the Black Lives Matter movement.
And more specifically, an African American Christian landmark, which once extended dignity, humanity, and community to freed slaves.
