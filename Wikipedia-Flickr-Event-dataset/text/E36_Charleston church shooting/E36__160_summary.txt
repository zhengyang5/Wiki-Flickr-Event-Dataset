President Barack Obama closed his eulogy for his late friend, the Rev.
Clementa Pinckney—who was gunned down last week by racist mass shooter Dylann Roof—by leading the crowd at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in singing “Amazing Grace.”Before singing the hymn, Obama acknowledged the racist motivation behind the shooting, saying it “raises questions about a dark part of our history.” So does the Confederate flag, “a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation,” he added.
“By taking down that flag we express God’s grace.
But I don’t think God wants us to stop there.”
