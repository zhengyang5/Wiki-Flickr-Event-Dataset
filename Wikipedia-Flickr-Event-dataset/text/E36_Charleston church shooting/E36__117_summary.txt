The U.S. Black Lives Matter movement released a statement Friday extending condolences to the families and community of the nine victims of the shooting at the Charleston Emanuel AME Church and condemning the attack as an act of terrorism.
“We are reminded today that while our attention has focused on increasing state and police violence against Black people, racist vigilante attacks are a large part of this country’s legacy,” said the Black Lives Matter statement.
Now, this iconic location rich in Black history and pride, will “be known as the site of an unspeakable and tragic act,” said Black Lives Matter activists in the statement.
And for Black Lives Matter, this history and the present are deeply connected, both in terms of discrimination and violence against the Black community, but also resistance.
