Columbia Police Department arrest reports outline two separate incidents in which Dylann Storm Roof, the suspect in Wednesday's church massacre in Charleston, was arrested at Columbiana Centre.
The officer asked Roof is he had gotten any applications from the stores and he said he had not.
The officer then searched Roof and found an unlabeled white bottle containing orange strips, which Roof identified as Listerine Strips.
The officer arrested Roof and had his 2000 Hyundai Elantra towed.
The Elantra is the same vehicle Roof allegedly drove to Emanuel AME Church in Charleston on Wednesday before shooting nine people.
