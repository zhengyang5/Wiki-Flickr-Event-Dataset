Family members of the Emanuel AME victims see portraits of their loved ones for the first time at Principle Gallery.
Nine artists from across the country have created portraits of the nine victims of the Emanuel AME church shooting, as part of a month-long exhibit at a Charleston art gallery.
The portraits were unveiled to the victims' families at Principle Gallery on Sunday.
The artists volunteered their time to paint or draw the portraits, using conversations with family members and pictures as inspiration.
"It was very emotional for these artists," Russen said.
