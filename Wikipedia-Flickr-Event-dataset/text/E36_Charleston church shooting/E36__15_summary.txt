Here’s the historian Ira Berlin, summing up what is known of Vesey’s life:It is a story well worth the telling.
Rather than being satisfied with a pale imitation of freedom, Vesey became increasingly discontented.
He sneered at those who accepted bondage and deferred to whites, declaring that they deserved to be slaves.
Vesey believed slavery would only end with fire, and understood that a successful insurrection rested upon uniting the fragmented black population.
Vesey coaxed and cajoled, implored and exhorted, flattered and bullied until his scheme was in place.
