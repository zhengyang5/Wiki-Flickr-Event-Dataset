A company that touts itself as “The Greatest Name In Flags” will no longer make or offer the Confederate flag, a move that comes one day after top political leaders in South Carolina called for the flag to be removed from statehouse grounds following last week’s deadly church shooting.
Valley Forge Flag, a major Pennsylvania-based U.S. flag manufacturer, said Tuesday that it will cease its production and sale of Confederate flags in the wake of the June 17 shooting in a historic black church in Charleston, Reuters reports.

Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn has similarly spoken out in favor of a change to the design of the Mississippi state flag, which incorporates the Confederate battle emblem.
