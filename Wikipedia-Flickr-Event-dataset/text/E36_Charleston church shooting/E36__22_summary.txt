One of the most egregious terrorist acts in U.S. history was committed against a black church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963.
But listen to major media outlets, and you won’t hear the word “terrorism” used in coverage of Wednesday’s shooting.
But it will be difficult to hold to this corrosive, racist media narrative when reporting on the Charleston shooting.
I hope the coverage won’t fall back on the typical narrative ascribed to white, male shooters: lone, disturbed or mentally ill young men failed by society.
The Charleston shooting is a result of an ingrained culture of racism and a history of terrorism in America.
