FBI Director James B. Comey says Roof should not have been allowed to purchase the gun used in the attack.
The errors came to light as investigators examined a gun purchase Roof made two months before the shooting.
As a result, an FBI examiner assigned to review Roof’s purchase never saw his admission to the narcotics charge.
The failure to block Roof’s gun purchase is likely to renew scrutiny of a federal background-check system that also allowed troubled individuals to acquire firearms before previous shootings.
On April 16, after the mandatory three-day waiting period lapsed with no adverse ruling from the FBI, Roof got his gun — a .45-caliber Glock pistol.
