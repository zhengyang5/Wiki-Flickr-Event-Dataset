CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) -- Thousands of people joined members of the Emanuel AME Church and Mount Pleasant Police Chief Carl Ritchie Sunday night in a unity march to the top of the Ravenel Bridge dubbed the Bridge to Peace.
People were high-fiving, hugging and singing as they walked up the bridge to create a unity chain.
The group was led by police chief Ritchie, Jay Johnson, the leader of the "Official Black Lives Matter" group, and members of the victims' families.
Before the march started, Johnson spoke, telling the crowd it was time for Black Lives Matter to end and a new group to be born -- All Lives Matter.
You made history, Charleston," Johnson said repeatedly as he encountered people.
