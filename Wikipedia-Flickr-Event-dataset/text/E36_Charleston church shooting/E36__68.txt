His father also told investigators Roof, 21, owned a .45-caliber handgun, the warrants say.

Roof, whoâ€™s now in police custody, allegedly confessed to killing nine people at Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church Wednesday night, according to a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation.

Roof allegedly stood over a survivor and "uttered a racially inflammatory statement" before leaving the Bible study room where the victims were shot, according to warrants.

Roof, who appeared at a bond hearing this afternoon, has been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, according to the Charleston Police Department.

"We are getting cooperation at this point," the law enforcement official told ABC News today.

Interviews with Roof are ongoing, the official said.

Roof spent Thursday night in protective custody and on suicide watch at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, according to the Charleston County Sheriff's Office. Roof is permitted to have visitors, but no one has come to see him, the Sheriff's Office said today.

He has been assigned public defender Ashley Pennington, according to court personnel. Pennington has not responded to ABC News' request for comment.
