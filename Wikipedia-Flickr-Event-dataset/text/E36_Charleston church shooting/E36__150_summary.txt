Houston-based lawyer Charles Cotton, listed as a national NRA board member on the gun lobby's website, made the comments in an online chat room he administers called texaschlforum.com, a discussion board devoted to gun rights and firearms issues.
"Eight of his church members who might be alive if he had expressly allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead," Cotton wrote.
"It's my opinion that there should not be any gun-free zones in schools or churches or anywhere else.
If we look at mass shootings that occur, most happen in gun-free zones," he told the newspaper.
The U.S. Justice Department said it is investigating the church attack as both a hate crime and potential act of terrorism.
