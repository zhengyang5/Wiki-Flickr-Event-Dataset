Message of solidarity sent to African Methodist Episcopal Church

The President and Vice-President of the Methodist Conference have sent a letter of solidarity to the African Methodist Episcopal Church following the killing of nine people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.

In their letter the Revd Kenneth Howcroft and Ms Gill Dascombe express their horror and sadness over the killings.

The full message and a prayer follow:

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ



We are horrified and deeply saddened to hear of the vicious killing of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The hearts of the members of the Methodist Church in Great Britain go out to the families and friends of those killed; to the Church; and to the wider communities in Charleston. We thank God for the lives of those who have died. We thank God and pray for you all in these difficult times; and will try to pray for the killer and any of similar mind. We will stand alongside you all in bewilderment, grief and, above all, prayer. May God bless you all.



Gracious God,

When sudden death makes the world go dark,

help us to mourn with those who mourn,

to hunger and thirst for righteousness with them,

and to be peacemakers in a violent world.

Where our minds seem confused,

our spirits disordered,

and the world in chaos,

may your Spirit bring order,

and the blessing of hope.

In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen



The Revd Kenneth Howcroft

President of the Conference 2014-15

Gill Dascombe

Vice-President of the Conference 2014-15
