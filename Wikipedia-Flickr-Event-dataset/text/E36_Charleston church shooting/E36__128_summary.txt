Michelle and I know several members of Emanuel AME Church.
This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America.
The fact that this took place in a black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our history.
That, certainly, was Dr. King’s hope just over 50 years ago, after four little girls were killed in a bombing in a black church in Birmingham, Alabama.
Mother Emanuel church and its congregation have risen before –- from flames, from an earthquake, from other dark times -– to give hope to generations of Charlestonians.
