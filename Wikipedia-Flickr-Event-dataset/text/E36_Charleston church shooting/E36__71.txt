Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man, is suspected of targeting a historic African-American church because of his racial hatred and his Facebook page suggests a fascination with apartheid and white supremacy.

The massacre has provoked huge public anger in the US in after a year of rising racial tensions that led to riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and nationwide protests over police brutality and the deaths of young black men.

Roof was arrested after a 14-hour manhunt yesterday when his car was stopped in a small North Carolina town, 220 miles north of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
