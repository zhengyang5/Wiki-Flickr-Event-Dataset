Whether you call it terrorism or not, law enforcement officials say they are aware of home-grown threats around the globe.
But a growing number of leading law enforcement officials question whether there is a meaningful divide between foreign-inspired attacks and those fuelled by white supremacist or anti-government ideologies.
According to a California county sheriff’s deputy whose job is to run intelligence operations inside jails to sniff out information about possible extremist attacks, there is plenty more that law enforcement could be doing to stop future Dylann Roofs.
“In Roof’s case, there was his buddy who was on probation who took the kid’s gun but was scared to contact law enforcement and gave the gun back.
Often, local law enforcement knows what’s going on but the people in Washington are clueless … There’s no aggregation of the intelligence and no structure.”Cohen offered a similar but more measured assessment.
