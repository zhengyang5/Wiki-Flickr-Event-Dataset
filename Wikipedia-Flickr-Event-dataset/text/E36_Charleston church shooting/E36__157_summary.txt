Columbia (United States) (AFP) - Several thousand protesters gathered under the controversial Confederate flag at South Carolina's state legislature, demanding it be taken down in response to the Charleston church massacre.
Organizers called the event a "warm-up" for what they hope will be an even bigger anti-flag protest, also in front of the colonaded State House, on the Fourth of July holiday.
The Confederate flag is not a symbol of Southern pride but rather a symbol of rebellion and racism," it said.
Police on Saturday were investigating a racist online manifesto that appeared on a website that also carried pictures of Roof with the Confederate flag and a handgun.
Former Republican White House hopeful Mitt Romney tweeted "it's time to take down flag in SC."
