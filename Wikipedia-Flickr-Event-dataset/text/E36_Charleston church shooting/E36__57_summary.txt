Via Twitter users @HenryKrinkle and @EMQuangel, here is what appears to be Charleston shooter Dylann Roofâ€™s racist manifesto.
The other reason is the Jewish agitation of the black race.
Black people are racially aware almost from birth, but White people on average dont think about race in their daily lives.
They are by nature very racist and could be great allies of the White race.
How about we protect the White race and stop fighting for the jews.
