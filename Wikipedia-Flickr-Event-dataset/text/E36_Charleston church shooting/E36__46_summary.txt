(Photo: Screengrab from WLXT-TV in Columbia, S.C.)The father and uncle of accused Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof identified him from surveillance photos distributed to the media and contacted police, a warrant for Roof's arrest says.
Video surveillance from the church allegedly shows Roof's Hyundai Elantra pulling into the parking lot of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on Calhoun Street at 8:06 p.m.
"He met with parishioners" who were engaged in Bible study, the affidavit, signed by Charleston Police Det.
Video surveillance shows the shooter, described as a white male wearing a gray, long-sleeved shirt, emerging from the church carrying a handgun, looking both ways, and then getting back into the Hyundai Elantra.
