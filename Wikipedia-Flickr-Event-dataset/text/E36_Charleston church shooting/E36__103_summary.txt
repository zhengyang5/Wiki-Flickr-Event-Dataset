Ms. Sanders’s heart-rending account opened testimony in United States District Court after Mr. Roof’s lawyer began to argue for a sentence of life in prison for the 22-year-old avowed white supremacist.
Roof plans to jettison during a second phase of the trial, when jurors will decide whether he should be executed.
But he spent much of his 49-minute opening statement emphasizing Mr. Roof’s deliberateness and premeditation.
“We will prove to you that the defendant’s attack was cold and calculating,” Mr. Richardson said.
Mr. Bruck made no effort to dispute the thrust of the prosecution’s case.
