Morris Brown organized a church of persons of color and sought to have it affiliated with Allen's church.
During the Vesey controversy, the AME church was burned.
The congregation continued the tradition of the African church by worshipping underground until 1865 when it was formally reorganized, and the name Emanuel was adopted, meaning "God with us".
