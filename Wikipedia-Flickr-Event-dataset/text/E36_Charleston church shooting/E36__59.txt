A friend of the man suspected of shooting down nine people inside a historic black church in Charleston said he told him that the University of Charleston was the original target.

Christon Scriven said 21-year-old Dylann Roof told friends that he was planning an attack against the US university, but ruled it against because of security on the campus.

A police affidavit released Friday accused Roof of shooting all nine victims multiple times, and making a "racially inflammatory statement" as he stood over an unnamed survivor.

But Mr Scriven claims that Roof never made any racist remarks around him.
