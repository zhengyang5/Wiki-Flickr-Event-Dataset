Joey Meek in the trailer that his mother, Kim Konzny, and his two brothers sometimes shared with Dylann Roof.
Meek’s family also declined to comment before and after the hearing.
His girlfriend, Lindsey Fry — who said she was also questioned — told The Post that Meek was taken into custody at work Thursday afternoon.
Meek has said he and Roof were childhood friends and that Roof had asked him for a place to stay.
In the days before the shooting, Meek said Roof told him he was going to “do something crazy,” so Meek and Fry hid Roof’s gun.
