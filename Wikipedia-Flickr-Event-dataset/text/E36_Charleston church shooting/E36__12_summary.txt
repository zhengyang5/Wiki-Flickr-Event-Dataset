(CNN) Several people were killed in a shooting at an historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, a source close to the investigation told CNN.
The shooting took place Wednesday evening at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest AME church in the South.
But the source who spoke to CNN said several bodies were in the church that were yet to be identified.
"It's really bad.
It's a very bad scene," local pastor Thomas Dixon said.
