Nikki Haley on Thursday warned that divisive rhetoric like Donald Trump’s can lead to tragedies such as the massacre last summer at a black church in Charleston.
Ms. Haley, who has repeatedly spoken out against Mr. Trump, the GOP presumptive presidential nominee, acknowledged that she doesn’t believe his supporters are racist.
They’re upset with Washington, D.C. They’re upset nothing’s got done,” she said.
“The way he communicates that, I wish were different.”She said Mr. Trump has a responsibility for the country’s well-being to use a civil, respectful tone, AP reported.
Despite her criticism, Ms. Haley vowed earlier this year to back Mr. Trump if he secured the Republican presidential nomination.
