There is nothing isolated about the violence exacted upon black people by law enforcement officers, vigilantes or terrorists.
When police officers or extrajudicial neighborhood watchmen shoot dead descendants of this nation’s formerly enslaved population, they are recommitting themselves to the white American tradition of squashing out black life at every juncture possible.
That the Rev Pinckney, an outspoken advocate against police brutality, died from gunfire in his own church is a testament to the potency of white supremacy in American life.
Because, not even in black churches – havens of rest from the rigor of white supremacy – are we immune to white violence.
Therefore, a truly intersectional, multiracial, multifaith and secular movement for human rights must continue to put pressure on the federal government, until the federal government itself actually acts like black lives matter.
