Speaking to reporters at FBI headquarters in Washington DC, Mr Comey outlined a series of missed opportunities and incomplete paperwork that allowed Mr Roof to buy a firearm.
That admission should have been enough to stop him from buying a weapon, Mr Comey said, but the offence was incorrectly added to Mr Roof's record.
"If she had seen that police report," Mr Comey said, "that purchase would have been denied."
Critics have long called it a symbol of slavery and the backlash against it grew when pictures of Mr Roof posing with the banner were discovered online.
Mr Roof was arrested the day after the shooting more than 200 miles away in North Carolina and then flown back to Charleston.
