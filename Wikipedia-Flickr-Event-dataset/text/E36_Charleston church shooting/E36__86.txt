A federal hearing has been scheduled in February for the man accused of shooting nine people at Mother Emanuel in June.

The hearing for Dylann Roof and Joey Meek, his friend accused of lying to authorities about what he knew of Roof's alleged plans, is scheduled for the morning of Feb. 11.

The US Justice Department has yet to decide if it will seek the death penalty against Roof on federal charges.

Local prosecutors however will.

Roof's state trial is scheduled in July.

According to prosecutors, Meek lied and failed to report what he knew about Roof's plans for shooting parishioners at the Emanuel AME Church.
