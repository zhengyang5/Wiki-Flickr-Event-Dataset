A black friend of the white man accused of murdering nine people at a Charleston church says the suspect told him a week prior to the killings that he planned to shoot up a local college campus.
Christon Scriven, a drinking buddy of Dylann Roof, told The Associated Press Friday that he thought Roofâ€™s statements were just drunken bluster.
"He just said he was going to hurt a bunch of people" at the College of Charleston," said Scriven, 22.
Meek and his family were close to Roof until Roof dropped out of his high school.
Scriven said he told Meek about what Roof had said, and the two of them decided to take Roof's gun.
