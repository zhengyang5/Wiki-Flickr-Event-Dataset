HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The massacre at a predominantly black South Carolina church has institutions from Alaska to Connecticut evaluating whether they should continue enshrining the names of historical figures linked to slavery and the Confederacy.
The petition says the name, in place since the 1930s, represents "an indifference to centuries of pain and suffering among the black population."
In Helena, Montana, officials will meet Wednesday to discuss whether anything should be done with a downtown memorial to fallen Confederate soldiers.
Bill Walter has informed the U.S. Census Bureau he plans to change the name of a census district named for Confederate military leader Wade Hampton.
The onetime slave owner rose to the rank of lieutenant general while fighting for the Confederacy during the Civil War.
