Federal law-enforcement agencies have concluded that recent fires in black churches in the southeastern U.S. are unrelated.
“To date the investigations have not revealed any potential links between the fires,” Justice Department spokeswoman Melanie Newman told Reuters.
The most recent fire, at Mount Zion AME church in Greeleyville, S.C., on June 30, is among the latter.
“The investigation is complete.”Mount Zion has burned down before, set aflame by the KKK in 1995 as part of a string of 30 suspicious fires at black churches across the south.
This kind of fraught history is the foundation of continuing suspicions regarding the church fires, activist-writer David Love told CNN.
