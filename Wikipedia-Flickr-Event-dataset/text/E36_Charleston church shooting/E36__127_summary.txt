President Barack Obama responded Thursday to the shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, that left nine dead.
"Any death of this sort is a tragedy, any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy," he said.
... We as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."
South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford (D) tweeted Thursday that he received a call from the president expressing his regret.
