The white man charged with the shooting deaths of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church asked a judge on Sunday if he could have his defense team back, at least temporarily.
In a handwritten request, Dylann Roof asked U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel to bring his defense team back on board for the guilt phase of his federal death penalty trial, which begins this week in Charleston.
"I would like to ask if my lawyers can represent me for the guilt phase of the trial only," Roof wrote.
"Can you let me have them back for the guilt phase, and then let me represent myself for the sentencing phase of the trial?
Death penalty cases are split into two parts: the guilt phase, and then a separate portion that focuses on whether or not the defendant will be sentenced to death or life in prison.
