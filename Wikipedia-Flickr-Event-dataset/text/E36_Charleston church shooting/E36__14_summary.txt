And you have to go.” That’s what gunman Dylann Storm Roof reportedly declared before murdering nine African-Americans at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday.
Instead, he may have been the victim of racist paranoia, much like the nine African-Americans whom Roof has confessed to murdering.
Denmark Vesey arrived in the United States as a teenager on a slave ship in 1781.
Vesey learned to read and write English and also spoke some French, both hallmarks of high status in South Carolina’s slave community.
And shortly after that, Denmark and Susan Vesey joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
