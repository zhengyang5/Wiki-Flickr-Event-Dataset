The Global Terrorism Database reports that there were 83 terrorist attacks on religious institutions or figures in the United States between 1970 and 2013.
However, analysts generally do not consider Waco a “terrorist attack” or otherwise directly comparable to the Charleston massacre.
Another disaster at a religious center was the 1978 Jonestown massacre, killing more than 900 Americans, but this happened in Guyana, not in the United States.
Of terrorist attacks on U.S. religious institutions, the Charleston massacre appears to be the most deadly in recent memory.
In the United States, counterterrorism tools such as wiretaps and monitoring Internet communication make organized terrorism harder than ever to carry out.
