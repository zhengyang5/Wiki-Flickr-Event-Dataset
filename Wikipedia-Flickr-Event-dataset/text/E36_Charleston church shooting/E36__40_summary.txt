Pinckney, 41, was among the nine shot to death at Wednesday night Bible study.
“She said it was just like...it was just blood all over the place,” Johnson told ABC News.
Johnson said the survivor told her the gunman, addressing her son, said, "You all rape women and you're taking over our country."
The survivor said it wasn't until the end of Bible study when the suspect just started shooting, according to Johnson.
When the elderly woman said "No," the gunman said, "Good, because I need someone to survive," and said he was going to shoot himself, the survivor told Johnson.
