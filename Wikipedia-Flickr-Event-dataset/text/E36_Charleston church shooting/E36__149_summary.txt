A white nationalist group that may have influenced the suspected gunman in last week’s massacre at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina said Sunday in a statement that it believes he had “legitimate grievances” against black people.
A spokesman for the group condemned the Charleston shooting while suggesting that the suspected gunman’s motives were still legitimate.
In his statement, Taylor said the manifesto outlined “legitimate grievances” without specifying what those grievances were.
