Nine people were shot dead during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina.
As word of the shooting spread, Bryant, who is the senior bishop for the national AME Church, said prayers and condolences poured into his inbox.
In the book of Jeremiah, the sixth chapter and the 14th verse, there is an apropos scripture that says: 'They have healed the brokenness of My people superficially, saying, 'Peace, peace,' But there is no peace."
