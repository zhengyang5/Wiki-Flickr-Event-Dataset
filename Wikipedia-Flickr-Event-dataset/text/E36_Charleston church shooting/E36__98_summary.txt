A federal judge will allow Dylann Roof to hire back his lawyers for the guilt phase of his trial, which begins this week in Charleston, South Carolina.
He originally was allowed to represent himself at trial, but asked a judge on Sunday if he could have his defense team back, at least temporarily.
In a handwritten request, Roof asked U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel to bring his defense team back on board for the guilt phase of his federal death penalty trial.
"I would like to ask if my lawyers can represent me for the guilt phase of the trial only," Roof wrote.
"Can you let me have them back for the guilt phase, and then let me represent myself for the sentencing phase of the trial?
