Gergel ruled Roof was competent, but he sealed a document containing the reasons for his finding.
Disclosing the document would jeopardize Roof's right to a fair trial, the judge said.
The process of selecting a jury of Roof's peers resumed Monday.
Federal court officials said 20 jurors were questioned during the deliberation, seven of those were found to be qualified and 13 jurors were excused.
The court will continue questioning jurors until 70 qualified jurors are identified.
