Debbie Dills was driving to work on Thursday through Shelby, North Carolina – about four hours’ drive from Charleston – when she spotted a black Hyundai with a South Carolina plate and a confederate flag.
“There was just something inside of me that said it just didn’t look right to me,” she said.
When she pulled up alongside, she saw the driver’s blond bowl haircut and immediately called her boss, Todd Frady.
“Everything inside of me said it’s possible, but everything inside of me didn’t want to believe it either,” she said.
“He answered the prayers of those people who were praying in Charleston last night, who were holding hands and praying.”
