Last week Mr Roof was deemed competent to stand trial in the shooting of nine Charleston parishioners in June 2015.
Acting as his own lawyer, Mr Roof could end up questioning family members of the victims and survivors in court.
Mr Roof faces 33 federal charges, including a hate crime count.
Mr Roof allegedly spared three people in the attack so they could tell authorities the shootings were because he hated black people.
Photos emerged online in the aftermath of Mr Roof holding the Confederate battle flag, sparking a backlash against the emblem, which critics see as a symbol of slavery.
