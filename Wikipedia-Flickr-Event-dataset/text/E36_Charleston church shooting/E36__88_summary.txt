The move came moments after Roof, wearing a gray and white striped Charleston County Detention Center uniform and without handcuffs, entered the courtroom.
Roof had offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, a deal that was rejected by federal prosecutors who are seeking a death sentence.
Following the selection of the 70 prospective jurists, defense attorneys and prosecutors can begin striking members of the panel.
