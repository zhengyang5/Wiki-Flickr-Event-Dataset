Pray specifically for the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Senior Bishop John Bryant, Resident Bishop Richard Norris, and the people of Mother Emmanuel AME Church of Charleston.
Senior Bishop John Bryant and Senior Bishop Reddick, less than a week after our March 20th meeting, shared this economic interest with other Methodist bishops during the Consultation of Methodist Bishops in Atlanta, Georgia.
That gathering called together AME, AME Zion, CME, UAME (Union American Methodist Episcopal), and United Methodist bishops in a conclave which meets biennially.
Please view us on the CME Church Channel on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/CMEChurch and spread the word.
The call is about becoming a CME Church that is focused on being available to God as God makes us better disciples.
