Jon Stewart opened up The Daily Show Thursday with a powerful, scathing and heartbreaking monologue about the church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina that left nine people dead.
After warning the audience that he had nothing for them "in terms of jokes and sounds," Stewart launched into a probing examination about how the incident in South Carolina happened and why these shooting will continue to happen.
After The Daily Show episode aired, the alleged Charleston shooter, Dylann Roof, reportedly confessed to the South Carolina police, telling them that he hoped to start a race war.
This wasn't a tornado; this was a racist," Stewart said.
I hate to even use this pun but this one is black and white, there's no nuance here."
