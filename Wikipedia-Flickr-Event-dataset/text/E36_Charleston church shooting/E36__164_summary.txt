The Confederate flag may or may not be removed from government buildings in South Carolina, but the relic is definitely being removed from at least one southern icon.
Warner Bros. today announced that it was halting production of toys and replicas of the General Lee, the car from the Dukes of Hazzard, which famously bore the flag on its roof.
The company follows in the footsteps of retailers Amazon, Sears, eBay, and Walmart, all of whom elected to ban sales of the Confederate flag and its image this week after the racially motivated murders in Charleston on Sunday.
Warner Bros. denied it was removing the flag in 2012As recently as 2012 Warner Bros. quashed rumors that it was planning to remove the Confederate flag from toy versions of the General Lee.
It's not clear whether Warner Bros. will continue to sell versions of the car with the flag removed, and if so, whether the company will need to change the General Lee's name.
