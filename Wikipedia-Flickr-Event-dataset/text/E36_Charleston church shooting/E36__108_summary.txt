Charleston, South Carolina: The Facebook profile picture chosen by Dylann Storm Roof in May is thick with symbolism.
It shows Roof, a scowling young white man, against a distinctly Southern backdrop: a swamp dripping with Spanish moss.
He attended high school in Lexington, about 40 miles west of Eastover.
From school records, Roof appears to have moved back and forth as a child between Richland County, which includes Eastover, and Lexington County.
He attended ninth grade twice: at White Knoll High School in Lexington in the 2008-09 school year and, the next school year, at White Knoll until February 2010, when he transferred to Dreher High School in Richland County.
