While assaults like the Boston Marathon bombing and the attack on an anti-Islamic gathering in Garland, Texas, last month have been widely portrayed as acts of terrorism, critics say that assaults against African Americans and Muslim Americans are rarely called terrorism.
But many civil-rights advocates are asking why the attack has not officially been called terrorism.
Samuel Sinyangwe, a civil-rights activist who has helped chronicle violence against African Americans, wrote: “#CharlestonShooting terrorist wore an Apartheid flag on his jacket.
If a Muslim man wore an ISIS flag, he wouldn’t get past mall security.”The definition of terrorism is a shifting and contentious subject, usually with political overtones.
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, a civil-rights group, said the Charleston massacre looked like terrorism to him.
