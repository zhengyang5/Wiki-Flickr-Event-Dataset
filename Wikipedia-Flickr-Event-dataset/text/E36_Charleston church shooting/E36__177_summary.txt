Was the Charleston Massacre an Act of Terrorism?
Authorities have identified Dylann Storm Roof, 21, as the man responsible for the massacre, and judging by initial reports, Roof’s alleged actions meet the criteria for the textbook definition of an act of terrorism.
Terrorist experts agree: “Based on this criteria, I feel comfortable calling this church massacre an act of terrorism,” said Max Abrahms, a terrorism scholar and professor at Northeastern University.
Contrast the immediate aftermath of the massacre at the offices of satirical newsweekly Charlie Hebdo with the attack in Charleston.
Terrorism in the United States and around the world, however, has a much longer history than the period after 9/11 and hasn’t been limited to radical Islamists.
