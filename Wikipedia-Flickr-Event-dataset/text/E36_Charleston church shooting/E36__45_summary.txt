The nine slain by Dylann Roof during a Wednesday night Bible study at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015, have become affectionately known as the Emanuel 9.
CLEMENTA PINCKNEYClementa Pinckney, a Ridgeland Democrat and pastor at Mother Emanuel AME Church, loved date nights with his wife Jennifer and above all, his daughters, Eliana and Malana.
Pinckney, 41, found his flock at Emanuel, giving sermons on Sundays participating in Bible study on Wednesday nights.
“Church at Mother Emanuel is pretty much an all-day thing.” Susie’s 70th birthday was a surprise party in Emanuel’s fellowship hall.
But as we said in Bible study, we enjoyed you but may God have mercy on you.”
