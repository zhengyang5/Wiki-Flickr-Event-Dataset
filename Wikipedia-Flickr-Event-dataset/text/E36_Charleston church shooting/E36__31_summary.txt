CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) â€” An intense manhunt was under way Thursday for a young white man who joined a prayer meeting and then opened fire inside a historic black church in downtown Charleston, killing nine people, including the pastor, in what authorities called a hate crime.
But State House Minority leader Todd Rutherford told The Associated Press that the Emanuel AME Church's pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, was among those killed.
Pinckney, 41, was a married father of two who was elected to the state House at age 23, making him the youngest member of the House at the time.
"We are going to put our arms around that church and that church family."
The Emmanuel AME church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charleston's Methodist Episcopal church.
