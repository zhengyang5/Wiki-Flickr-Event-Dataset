Governor Nikki Haley addresses a full church during a prayer vigil held at Morris Brown AME Church, South Carolina on Thursday.
South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley says the gunman who killed nine people during a shooting spree at a Charleston church should get the death penalty.
Cynthia Taylor told The Associated Press that she spoke with Sanders and that is what Sanders told her.
Taylor is the niece of 87-year-old shooting victim Susie Jackson, who was a longtime member of The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and sang in the choir.
