Investigators began to explore how much Roof’s associates knew, and when they knew it, after reviewing his cellphone and computer records, the sources said.
SUBSCRIBE NOWProsecutors are still studying exactly what charges, if any, some of those associates might face, the sources said.
Other charges might be lying to a federal law enforcement officer.
Apart from announcing Roof’s arrest and making public the nine state murder charges and one weapons charge against him, state and federal officials have made public relatively little about the case.
A circuit judge must set bond on the murder charges for Roof, who is still being held in the county jail.
