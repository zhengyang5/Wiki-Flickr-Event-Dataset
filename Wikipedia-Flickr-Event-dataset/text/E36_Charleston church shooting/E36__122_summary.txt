Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon told The Associated Press on Monday that a clerk at his jail entered in the incorrect location for Roof's drug arrest in February.
That meant an FBI examiner using records from a state database couldn't find the details about the arrest when Roof wanted to buy a gun.
The jail discovered mistakes two days after Roof's drug arrest, but the change wasn't corrected in the state police database of arrests.
So when an FBI examiner pulled Roof's records in April, she called the wrong agency.
Koon, the sheriff, said that when the FBI examiner called his deputies, they pointed out the arrest was by Columbia Police.
