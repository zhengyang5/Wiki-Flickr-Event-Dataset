Google is putting YouTube TV, its $35-per-month internet skinny bundle, into the top pitching spot for this year’s World Series.

Under a multi-pronged deal with Major League Baseball, YouTube TV will serve as the presenting sponsor of the baseball’s 2017 World Series with a variety of national TV spots and on-air callouts on Fox during each game. The deal also includes YouTube TV branding across MLB’s digital properties and social-media accounts, as well as in-stadium promotion.

In addition, YouTube TV is expected to incorporate MLB players competing in postseason play in its promo efforts. That will include the production of original content featuring pro ballplayers and YouTube creators taking fans behind-the-scenes at the World Series.

Finally, YouTube TV and MLB are launching a sweepstakes that will give grand-prize winners VIP access to the World Series and the chance to appear on the Fox national broadcast. The sweepstakes is expected to launch in early October, with details and official rules to be shared on YouTube’s and MLB’s social platforms.

“We are proud to team with You Tube on its first major partnership to help raise national awareness for YouTube TV,” Noah Garden, MLB’s EVP of business, said in a statement.

YouTube TV, initially launched in April 2017, provides more than 40 networks including live feeds from local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations in most markets. The service is currently available in 49 TV markets in the U.S., reaching two-thirds of the country. YouTube TV lacks a swath of cable networks, including those from Turner, Viacom, Discovery Communications and Scripps Networks Interactive. HBO isn’t available, but Showtime is available as a premium add-on.

Note that because YouTube TV doesn’t carry Turner networks, subscribers won’t be able to watch National League playoff games, including the National League Championship Series — all of which are being broadcast by TBS. Fox and FS1 are the home of the American League post-season contests.

YouTube TV lets users stream up to three video streams simultaneously, accessible on the web, iOS, Android and connected-TV devices including Google Chromecast and Apple TV (via AirPlay). The service also includes a network-based DVR — with no storage limits.

Google and MLB positioned the new World Series deal as building on their long-standing partnership. According to YouTube, Major League Baseball content has generated more than 1 billion video views on the platform to date in 2017.
