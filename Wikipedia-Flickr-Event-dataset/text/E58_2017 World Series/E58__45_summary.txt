The Dodgers and Astros have selected their starters for Game 1 of the World Series.
Left-hander Dallas Keuchel will open the series for the Astros, while fellow lefty Clayton Kershaw will take the mound for the first of two home games at Dodger Stadium.
Keuchel, 29, has been a steady presence for the Astros this postseason.
The 29-year-old southpaw recorded his second win of the playoffs with a run, three hits, a walk and five strikeouts over six innings.
Unlike Keuchel, heâ€™s given up a home run in each of his outings to date (and four homers in Game 1 of the NLDS).
