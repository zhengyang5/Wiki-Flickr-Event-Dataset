The thrilling 10-inning win by the Astros in Game 5 of the World Series drew a 12.8 overnight, per Austin Karp of Sports Business Daily.
That topped the 9.4 overnight rating, per an industry source, for the Steelers’ win over the Lions on NBC.
It’s not the only time the World Series has topped Sunday Night Football in the overnights but it is not a regular occurrence.
According to Sports Media Watch, that was the first time since 2013 that the World Series has topped SNF head-to-head.
Fox said the World Series game peaked at a 14.5 overnight rating from 11:30 to 11:45 p.m.
