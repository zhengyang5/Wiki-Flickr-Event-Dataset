HOUSTON -- Alex Bregman is 23 years old and about to complete his first full season in the big leagues.
The Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers crammed a week's worth of drama into a Game 5 that lasted for 10 innings and more than five hours.
He was facing Jansen, the best closer in the game, and he went to hit knowing that the game was going to be over."
Astros starter Dallas Keuchel entered the game with a 2.32 ERA in 57 starts at home since 2014.
"I thought Game 2 was probably the best baseball game I ever played in," Bregman said.
