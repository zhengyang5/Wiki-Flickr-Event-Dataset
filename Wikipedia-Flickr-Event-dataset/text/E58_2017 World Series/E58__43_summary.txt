After multiple games featuring the Dodgers trotting out legends from every era to throw out the first pitch before World Series games at Dodger Stadium, they welcomed back one of the biggest legends of all.
Sandy Koufax, in the house for Game 7!
He wasn’t the only one that was in the spotlight for the opening ceremony, though, as Steve Garvey, Don Newcombe, and Rick Monday all participated as well.
