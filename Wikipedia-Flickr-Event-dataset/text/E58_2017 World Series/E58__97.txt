Though well short of last year’s historic juggernaut, World Series Game 7 ratings were still massive on FOX.

Wednesday’s Astros-Dodgers World Series Game 7 had a 15.8 rating and 28.2 million viewers on FOX, down 28% in ratings and 29% in viewership from Cubs-Indians last year, the most-watched baseball game since 1991 (21.8, 40.1M), but up 15% and 20% respectively from Giants-Royals in 2014 (13.7, 23.5M).

The Astros’ title-clinching win trails only last year’s Game 7 as the highest rated and most-watched Major League Baseball game since 2004 (BOS-STL Game 4: 18.2, 28.8M).

Overall, it delivered baseball’s sixth-largest television audience in the past 20 years.

Viewership peaked at 32.0 million from 10:30-10:45 PM ET, more than an hour before the conclusion. Unlike previous games in the series, which were wild back-and-forth affairs, Houston maintained at least a 4-run lead for the final seven innings.

Excluding the NFL, Game 7 ranks as the highest rated and most-watched sporting event of the year — topping January’s Clemson-Alabama college football national championship (14.2, 25.3M). Baseball has now delivered the top non-NFL audience in two consecutive years.

Game 7 delivered an 8.2 rating in adults 18-49, down 35% from last year (12.6) but up 24% from 2015 (6.6). The 8.2 is the second-highest for a baseball game since Red Sox-Cardinals Game 4 in 2004 (10.0).

For the year, the 8.2 ranks third among non-NFL sporting events behind Game 5 of the Warriors-Cavaliers NBA Finals (9.0) and Clemson-Alabama (8.3).

The game also had a 6.5 in adults 18-34 (-38%) and a 9.5 in adults 25-54 (-34%).

Despite the overall decline, Spanish-language viewership on Fox Deportes increased 37% from last year’s Game 7 (from 565K to 778M). The streaming audience on Fox Sports GO was down a relatively modest 14% (from 344K to 294K). Across all Fox Sports platforms, Game 7 had 29.3 million viewers (-28%) — just ahead of 2004 as the second-biggest baseball audience since Giants-Angels in 2002 (30.9M).
