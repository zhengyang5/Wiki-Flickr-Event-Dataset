The 2017 World Series will feature the first postseason matchup of two 100-win teams in 40 years, with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros meeting in the Fall Classic.

The World Series begins on Tuesday night at 8:09 p.m. ET in Game 1, with the first two games at Dodger Stadium, by virtue of the 104-win Dodgers finishing with the best record in baseball.

Houston won 101 games, making this the first postseason matchup between 100-game winners since the 1977 ALCS between the New York Yankees and Kansas City Royals. This is the first World Series matchup between 100-win teams since 1970, when the Baltimore Orioles beat the Cincinnati Reds.

The Dodgers are back in the World Series for the first time since 1988, and itâ€™s their the 19th time overall.

This is the second World Series for the Astros, who also made it in 2005, when they played in the National League team. The Dodgers and Astros played together in the NL West for 25 years (1969-1993) and met one previous time in the postseason. In the strike-shortened 1981 campaign, the Dodgers beat the Astros three games to two in the NL Division Series.

Joe Buck and John Smoltz will call the World Series for Fox, along with reporters Tom Verducci and Ken Rosenthal.
