Gurriel will not miss any World Series games, and his suspension will begin at the start of the 2018 season.
HOUSTON -- Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel received a five-game suspension without pay for an offensive gesture directed at Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish during Game 3 of the World Series, Commissioner Rob Manfred announced on Saturday afternoon.
Gurriel will not miss any World Series games, and his suspension will begin at the start of the 2018 season.
Manfred felt it was "unfair to punish the other 24 players on the Astros' roster" during the World Series.
"The Houston Astros were surprised and disappointed by the behavior displayed by Yuli Gurriel during last night's game," the club said in a statement.
