Goose Gossage and former pitcher Charlie Hough are the only two players in baseball history who endured all eight work stoppages.
It was the 1994 Major League Baseball strike.
The strike canceled the rest of the 1994 season, and for the first time since 1904, even the World Series.
"Most of these guys in the big leagues today,'' Gossage says, "they don't have any freakin' clue on how they're being paid all of this money.
Gossage's Hall of Fame career began with a strike as a rookie in 1972 with the Chicago White Sox and ended with the 1994 strike with the Seattle Mariners, with six work stoppages in between.
