Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Yu Darvish, of Japan, leaves the game against the Houston Astros during the second inning of Game 3 of baseball's World Series Friday, Oct. 27, 2017, in Houston.
On baseball's biggest stage, he got just five outs and left with a four-run deficit in Friday's night's 5-3 loss to Houston, which put the Dodgers in a 2-1 World Series hole.
HOUSTON -- Pitching in his World Series debut, Yu Darvish kept turning his head as balls clanked off the outfield wall or soared over it.
Ahead of his start, Darvish joked he should receive a gracious greeting because he wore a "Houston Strong" T-shirt last month to raise money for hurricane relief.
The bullpen stretched a scoreless streak to 28 innings during Game 2 on Wednesday night before blowing a save and losing in 11 innings.
