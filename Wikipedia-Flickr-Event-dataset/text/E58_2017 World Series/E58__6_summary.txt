LOS ANGELES -- Earlier in the World Series, Houston Astros center fielder George Springer talked about not letting the magnitude of playing in it become overwhelming.
Springer was an easy choice for the Willie Mays World Series Most Valuable Player Award, after hitting .379 (11-for-29) with five home runs and seven RBIs.
His eight extra-base hits were the most ever in a World Series, and he is the first player to homer in four straight games within a single World Series, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.
Houston's George Springer hit .379 with a World Series record-tying five home runs and seven RBIs in taking home MVP honors.
The other is Art Ditmar, who did so for the New York Yankees in Games 1 and 5 of the 1960 World Series.
