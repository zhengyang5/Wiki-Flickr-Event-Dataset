Orel Hershiser and Tommy Lasorda, two Dodger greats from different eras, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Dodger Stadium before World Series Game 6 on Tuesday.
Hershiser and LaSorda!
Importantly, he was the 1988 NLCS and World Series MVP.
He pitched Games 2 and 5 of the â€˜88 World Series, the last one the Dodgers won, and won both of them for LA.
Hall of Famer Tommy Lasorda was of course the manager for that World Series, having managed the Dodgers for two decades from 1976 to 1996.
