The Dodgers pulled out all the stops for the first pitch of Game 2 of the World Series Wednesday.
It was supposed to be a chance for legendary broadcaster Vin Scully to throw out the ceremonial pitch for the team he broadcasted games for for 67 years, but that wasn't good enough.
As Scully teased the crowd pretending to get ready to throw the pitch, he asked to get a catcher.
Naturally 1981 World Series MVP Steve Yeager came out to answer his request.
From Vin Scully to Fernando Valenzuela.
