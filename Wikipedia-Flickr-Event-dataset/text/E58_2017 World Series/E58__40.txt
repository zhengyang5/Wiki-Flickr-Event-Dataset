HOUSTON -- Seven-year-old Hailey Dawson, who was born without three fingers on her right hand, threw out the ceremonial first pitch with a 3-D printed prosthetic hand at Game 4 of the World Series on Saturday night.

Dawson's prosthesis was gold and had the words "World Series'' on it. She tossed the ball to Houston Astros star Jose Altuve, who hugged her before signing the hand.

Earlier on Saturday, Houston ace Justin Verlander gifted the little girl, who is from Las Vegas, with custom-made cleats that said "Vegas Strong.''

Dawson's goal is to throw out a pitch at every major league ballpark. She first tossed a pitch at Camden Yards in 2015.
