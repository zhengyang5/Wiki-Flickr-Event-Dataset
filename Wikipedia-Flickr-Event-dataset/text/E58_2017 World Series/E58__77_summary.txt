Dodgers outfielder Joc Pederson continued his October resurgence with yet another home run in Tuesday’s 3-1 win over the Astros, pushing the World Series to a Game 7.
Pederson gave the Dodgers an insurance run in the seventh inning against Joe Musgrove, his third of the series.
The only Dodger to hit more home runs in a single World Series was Duke Snider, who clubbed four home runs in both 1952 and 1955.
“You see that true, raw emotion when that home run was hit, it was incredible.”Pederson has an extra-base hit in each of the last five games, tying the World Series record last done by Amos Otis in 1980.
Pederson has a hit and a run scored in each of his five games in this Fall Classic, just the second player to do so in each of his first five World Series games.
