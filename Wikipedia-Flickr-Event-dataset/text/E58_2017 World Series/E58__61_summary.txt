Yu Darvish says he isn't angry toward Yuli Gurriel, calling it a learning experience for Gurriel and adding that no one is perfect.
(2:04)HOUSTON -- Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel faces potential discipline from Major League Baseball for making a racially insensitive gesture Friday night during Game 3 of the World Series.
The 33-year-old Gurriel is a native of Cuba who played for the Yokohama DeNA Baystars of the Japanese Central League in 2014.
"I feel like, of course, Houston has Asian fans and Japanese fans, and Asian fans live all over the place," Darvish said.
Most Astros players said they weren't aware that Gurriel had made a gesture or that they hadn't seen it.
