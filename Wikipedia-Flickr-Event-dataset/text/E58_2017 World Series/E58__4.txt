The Year of the Homer ended with the World Series of the Homer.

The world champion Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers set several records during the seven-game series, most of them centered around the long ball. Following a regular season that produced more home runs than any other in baseball history, the Astros and the Dodgers combined to launch a record 25 home runs, shattering the previous record of 21 set in 2002 by the Angels and the Giants.

World Series MVP George Springer smashed five to tie Reggie Jackson (1977) and Chase Utley (2009) for the most in a single World Series. His three-run shot in the second inning of Game 7 was the Astros’ 15th of the series, breaking the previous team record of 14 held by Barry Bonds and the 2002 Giants. Springer also set World Series marks with 29 total bases, eight extra-base hits (surpassing Willie Stargell’s seven in 1979) and home runs in four straight games within the same Series. Not bad for a player who struck out four times in Game 1.
