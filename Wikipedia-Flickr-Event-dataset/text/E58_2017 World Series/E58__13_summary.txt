The 2017 World Series is here, and the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros will feature a matchup between two 100-win teams in the Fall Classic for the first time since 1970.
The Dodgers won 104 games, the most by any MLB team in 13 years, and finished three games ahead of the Astros, with 101 victories.
But the last time a World Series featured two 100-win teams was the 1970 Fall Classic, when Earl Weaverâ€™s Baltimore Orioles won 108 games and a championship, beating the 102-win Cincinnati Reds in October.
In all, there have been 10 previous postseason matchups between 100-win teams, including seven times in the World Series.
In these series, the team with the best record has won six of 10 times (60%).
