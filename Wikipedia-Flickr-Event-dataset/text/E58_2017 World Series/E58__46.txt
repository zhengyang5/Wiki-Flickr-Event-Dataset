LOS ANGELES -- Chris Taylor captured co-MVP honors in the NLCS, and got his World Series off to a strong start, hitting the first pitch of the bottom of the first inning out for a home run against Astros starter Dallas Keuchel.

The home run travelled 447 feet.

Taylorâ€™s blast gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead, and was the fourth leadoff home run in Game 1 of a World Series, and the first since Alcides Escobar against Matt Harvey in 2015.

It was the third home run to leadoff a game in Dodgers postseason history, joining Davey Lopes (Game 6 of the 1978 World Series) and Carl Crawford (Game 4 of the 2013 NLDS).

Taylor leads the Dodgers with three home runs this postseason, hitting .303 (10-for-33) with seven walks, two doubles, and a triple.
