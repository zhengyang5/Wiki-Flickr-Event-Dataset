On Tuesday night, Robinson’s widow, Rachel; daughter, Sharon; and son David returned to Dodger Stadium on the 45th anniversary of Robinson’s death to throw out the first pitch for Game 1 of the World Series.
The Dodgers, in their first World Series since 1988, defeated the Houston Astros 3-1.
45 yrs ago today Jackie Robinson passed away leaving behind a legacy that paved the way for me & so many to play this game!
“Mom, David and I were incredibly honored to throw out the ceremonial first pitch,” Sharon Robinson said Tuesday.
“I keep everybody else calm.”Calm would certainly describe the Dodgers team that took the opening game of the World Series against the Astros.
