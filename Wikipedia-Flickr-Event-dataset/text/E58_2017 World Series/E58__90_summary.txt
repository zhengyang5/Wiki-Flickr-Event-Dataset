Nobody expects World Series TV ratings to sniff last year, but Game 1 got off to a decent start.
Tuesday’s Astros-Dodgers World Series Game 1 had an 8.7 rating and 14.97 million viewers on FOX, down 23% in ratings and 22% in viewership from Cubs-Indians last year (11.3, 19.4M).
ADVERTISEMENTThe Dodgers’ win trails only last year as the most-watched World Series opener since Rangers-Giants in 2010 (15.01M).
Excluding last year’s series, all seven games of which had a larger audience, it earned the largest non-clinching World Series audience since Game 4 in 2013 (16.0M).
The shortest World Series game in 25 years peaked with 17.4 million viewers from 10:30 PM ET through the 10:40 PM conclusion.
