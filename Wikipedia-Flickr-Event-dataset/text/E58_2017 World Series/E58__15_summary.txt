Back at the trade deadline in 2015, the Braves, Dodgers and Marlins made a complicated three-team deal that included 13 players.
The meat of that deal was Wood going to the Dodgers and Hector Olivera going to the Braves.
Olivera was a Cuban free agent the Dodgers had signed for $62.5 million, including a $28 million signing bonus.
2 behind Kershaw leads me to this question: Could this be the best team in Los Angeles Dodgers history?
I imagine most Dodgers experts would point to the 1963 team, led by Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, as the best because it swept the New York Yankees in the World Series.
