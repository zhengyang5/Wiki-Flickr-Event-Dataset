Former president George W. Bush will throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday in Houston.

Bush will be joined by his father, former president George H.W. Bush, before the game at Minute Maid Park between the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers.

The older Bush will call "play ball" to start the game.

The younger Bush once was a part owner and managing general partner of the Texas Rangers.

The news comes a day after actress Heather Lind alleged that the elder Bush patted her posterior and told a dirty joke during a photo op. Bush since has released two apologies via statements.

Houston Texans defensive lineman J.J. Watt will throw out the first pitch on Friday for Game 3.

All three games in Houston this weekend will start at 8:20 p.m. ET.
