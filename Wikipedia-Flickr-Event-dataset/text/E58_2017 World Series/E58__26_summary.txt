(Reuters) - A World Series title would not heal the wounds of a city still coping with the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey but the Houston Astros’ run to the Fall Classic has given the city something to rally around.
The Astros will open the World Series on the road against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday, almost exactly two months after Hurricane Harvey, the strongest hurricane to hit Texas in more than 50 years, made landfall.
Verlander has already said he would donate $100,000 and his postseason share to the “Hurricane Harvey Patriot Grant Program” that will help those families impacted by Harvey.
The longtime Detroit Tigers pitcher, who joined the Astros days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in the hopes of chasing an elusive World Series ring, said he has enjoyed being part of a team that for some has provided a boost.
And I think it gives me a different sense of what’s going on here and now.”
