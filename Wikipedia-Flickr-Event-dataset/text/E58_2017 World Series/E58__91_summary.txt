Outside of the Cubs and Yankees’ outlier appearances, World Series ratings have not been this strong in years.
ADVERTISEMENTThe Astros’ extra-inning win trails only Cubs-Indians last year and Phillies-Yankees in 2009 (11.7, 18.9M) as the highest rated and most-watched World Series Game 2 in the past decade.
Outside of last year, it was the highest rated and most-watched non-clinching World Series game since Red Sox-Cardinals Game 4 in 2013 (9.4, 16.0M).
The 4.2 is the third-best for Game 2 of the World Series in a decade, a marked turnaround from Game 1 — which was the third-lowest rated in the demo all-time.
