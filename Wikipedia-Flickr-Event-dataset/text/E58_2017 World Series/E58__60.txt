HOUSTON — Yuli Gurriel, the Houston Astros first baseman who was seen making a racist gesture in the dugout during Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, has been given a five-game suspension without pay that will begin at the start of the 2018 season.

The suspension, which was handed down by Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, is the largest levied against a player for a public act of intolerance during a baseball game, exceeding by two games the suspension of Yunel Escobar, who was penalized for gay slurs written on his eye black strips in 2012.

Manfred’s decision, which he announced in a Saturday afternoon news conference, means that Gurriel will not have to sit out any of the remaining games of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers tied the Series at two games apiece with a 6-2 victory on Saturday night.

Gurriel is scheduled to earn $12 million in 2018 and will lose roughly $320,855 because of the suspension. He will also have to undergo sensitivity training.

“There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable,” Manfred said.

During Game 3 of the Series on Friday, Gurriel, who defected from Cuba in 2016, hit a home run off Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish in the bottom of the second inning. After Gurriel returned to the dugout, he was captured on camera smiling and then raising his hands as if to stretch the sides of his eyes. It seemed to be a clear, and pointedly insensitive, reference to Darvish, who is from Japan.

After Game 3 ended in a Houston victory, Gurriel was besieged by reporters, and he told them through an interpreter that he did not intend to offend Darvish. He maintained that he was telling teammates that maybe Darvish thought he was Japanese and that is why he gave him a good pitch to hit.

Darvish issued a statement Friday night forgiving Gurriel and asking people to learn from the incident.
