Sports Illustrated already had put out a couple different Astros commemorative issues to celebrate the team's first World Series title, and now they magazine is putting a couple of the Astros stars on the cover of their upcoming issue.

Jose Altuve, holding the World Series trophy, and George Springer, holding that now-famous 2014 Sports Illustrated that accurately predicted the Astros' championship, are on the cover of the upcoming Nov. 13 issue.

BACK IN 2014: What that 2014 Sports Illustrated cover story about the Astros got wrong

Now Playing:

The headline is: A Wild Ride: The Astros have come a long way since 2014, and this World Series trophy won't be their last."

The cover story is done by Ben Reiter, the same writer who penned the 2014 cover story about the Astros.

You can buy Astros related merchandise, including the Houston Chronicle Astros covers as well as that 2014 Sports Illustrated at: www.chron.com/shopastros.

That makes three Houston covers for Sports Illustrated this year. The Rockets' James Harden was on the cover in March and the Astros' Lance McCullers' curveball graced the cover in May.
