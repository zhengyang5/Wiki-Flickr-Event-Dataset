And while the playoffs are ostensibly designed to punish wild-card teams and reward division winners, matching two behemoths in the World Series is still challenging.
But suffice to say, many of them will be in this World Series.
The World Series hasn't featured an eventual MVP or Cy Young winner since 2012, when MVPs Buster Posey (San Francisco) and Miguel Cabrera (Detroit) collided.
And Posey was the last Rookie of the Year to play in a Fall Classic, in the Giants' first World Series triumph in 2010.
The Dodgers and Astros were the happy beneficiaries as the half-season champs of the NL West and met in a five-game series.
