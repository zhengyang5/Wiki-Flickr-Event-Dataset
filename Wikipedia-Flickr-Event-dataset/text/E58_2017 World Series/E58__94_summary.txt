One of the most entertaining matchups in recent memory continues to deliver some of the best World Series ratings in a decade.
Not counting last year, Game 5 also ranks as the highest rated and most-watched non-clinching World Series game since Rangers-Cardinals Game 6 in 2011 (12.7, 21.1M).
Compared to previous Sunday night World Series games, Game 5 trails only last year as the highest rated and most-watched since Yankees-Phillies Game 4 in 2009 (13.5, 22.8M).
Compared to last yearâ€™s World Series Game 5, ratings fell 21% in 18-49 (from 6.7), 20% in 25-54 (from 7.9) and 21% in 18-34 (from 5.3).
The Astros had never previously played in a World Series Game 5.
