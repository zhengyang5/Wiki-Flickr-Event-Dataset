With another shutout outing in NLCS Game 5 to wrap up the final game in the series, the Dodgers bullpen officially broke the record for the most consecutive innings without allowing a run.
The previous record was 22 2⁄ 3 innings, which the Dodgers passed with the last out of Thursday’s game to reach 23 straight innings.
The bullpen hasn’t let up a run since Brandon Morrow allowed a home run in Game 2 of the NLDS against the Diamondbacks.
The final NLCS line was 17 innings pitched, four hits, no runs, one walk, one hit-by-pitch, and 22 strikeouts.
That’s intimidating and should be for whichever team LA plays in the World Series, the Astros or Yankees.
