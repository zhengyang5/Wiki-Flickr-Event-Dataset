Jackie Robinson’s family threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Dodger Stadium in advance of Game 1 of the World Series Tuesday night.
With the Los Angeles heat over 100 degrees at the start of the game, the crowds were already in their seats for the emotional ceremonial start.
Members of the late Jackie Robinson’s family that participated included widow Rachel, 95 years old and the founder of the Jackie Robinson Foundation, as well as his children Sharon and David.
The Dodgers have made six World Series after his death (1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988, and this year) and won two (1981 and 1988).
Robinson is offered in a myriad of ways by MLB and other foundations each year, including the annual “Jackie Robinson Day” around the league.
