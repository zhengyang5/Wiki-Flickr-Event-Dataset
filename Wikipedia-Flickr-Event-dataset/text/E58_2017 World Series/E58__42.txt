Orel Hershiser and Tommy Lasorda, two Dodger greats from different eras, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Dodger Stadium before World Series Game 6 on Tuesday. It makes sense that both of them would do the honors for the (possible) penultimate game in the series, just it case the Astros end things before it can go the distance.

Hershiser played for the Dodgers in LA from 1983 to 1994, and then ended his career with the franchise in 2000 after playing with the Indians, Giants, and Mets. He had 204 wins in his career with a 3.48 career ERA.

Importantly, he was the 1988 NLCS and World Series MVP. He pitched Games 2 and 5 of the ‘88 World Series, the last one the Dodgers won, and won both of them for LA. In Game 2 he struck out eight, walked two, and allowed three hits in a complete game performance. He went the distance in Game 5 as well, allowing two runs in that 5-2 win but striking out nine.

Orel Hershiser was a pretty great pitcher, huh?

Hall of Famer Tommy Lasorda was of course the manager for that World Series, having managed the Dodgers for two decades from 1976 to 1996. He also won a World Series ring in 1955 (although he didn’t play in that series) and owns the record for longest tenure — in some way or another — with the Dodgers.

This first pitch ceremony wasn’t as lengthy or tearjerking as Vin Scully’s last week, but legends are legends and these two are as woven into the franchise’s fabric as anybody else out there.
