Game 2 of the World Series on Wednesday night was all about the home run.
The Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers combined for eight long balls at Dodger Stadium, the most ever in a World Series game.
The previous record was three, set by the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox in Game 1 of the 1995 AL Division Series.
The eight total homers bested the previous World Series record of seven set in 1989 by the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants.
Overall, there have been 11 home runs in this World Series so far, tied with 2002 (Angels-Giants) for the most in the first two games of a World Series, according to Elias Sports Bureau.
