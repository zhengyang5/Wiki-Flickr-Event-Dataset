For a non-traditional matchup with no real hook for casual fans, 2017 World Series ratings have far exceeded expectations.
Keep in mind Game 3 aired on a Saturday night from 2007-13, typically the lowest rated night of the World Series.
Viewership has now increased for each successive game of the World Series, climbing from 15.0 to 15.5 to 15.7 million.
Astros-Dodgers is the first World Series since 1999 to post successive growth over the first three games.
