Clayton Kershaw struck out four Astros in relief in Game 7 of the World Series, and in doing so set a Dodgers record for most strikeouts in a single postseason.
The Dodgers were trailing 5-0 when Kershaw entered, and he gave them four scoreless innings in relief.
Kershaw is 3-0 with a 3.82 ERA in his six postseason appearances in 2017, with 33 strikeouts in 33 innings.
Kershaw threw 94 pitches in his Game 5 start, and pitched Wednesday on two days rest, throwing 43 pitches.
“When you’re talking about Clayton Kershaw, Game 7, I think anything’s within reason,” Roberts said.
