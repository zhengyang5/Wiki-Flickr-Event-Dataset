—-Here’s how the Astros beat the Dodgers in Game 3, inning by inning:PhotoTop 1st: McCullers gets three quick outs.
Lance McCullers threw half of his 12 pitches in the inning to one batter, but worked around a single to keep the game scoreless.
Yu Darvish struggled to put pitches where he wanted them and that led to a great inning for struggling Astros batters.
It was the sixth home run hit in the last four innings of this World Series, going back to the extra innings of Game 2.
With one out, Yasiel Puig hit a grounder down the third-base line that Alex Bregman could not quite reach.
