Fox had to be expecting a year-to-year drop for the 2017 World Series ratings.
We talked about the big ratings Game 6 and Game 7 pulled yesterday, and those numbers combined with the strong series totals from last week to push the 2017 World Series to a hefty average viewership total.
The staff guessed anywhere from 15-17 million viewers per game, while the Twitter polling public were much less bullish:Where do you think the average World Series viewership this year will fall?
The 2016 World Series featured a classic Game 7, but the rest of the series featured only two close games.
Two of the sportâ€™s highest-rated World Series just happened over the last two years.
