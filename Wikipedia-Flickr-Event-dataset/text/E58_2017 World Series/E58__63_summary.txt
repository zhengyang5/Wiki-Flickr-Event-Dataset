(1:29)HOUSTON -- Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel will be suspended for five games -- but none during the World Series -- for racially insensitive behavior directed at Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish, baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said Saturday.
In deciding to wait until the beginning of next season, Manfred explained he wanted to make sure Gurriel's penalty included docking his $12 million salary -- he will lose $322,581.
"Obviously World Series games are different than regular-season games, and I used my best judgment as to where the appropriate disciplinary level fell.
But Gurriel also remained in the Astros' Game 4 lineup Saturday night, playing first base and batting fifth.
He finished the game 0-for-3 with a strikeout as the Dodgers beat the Astros 6-2 to even the World Series at two games apiece.
