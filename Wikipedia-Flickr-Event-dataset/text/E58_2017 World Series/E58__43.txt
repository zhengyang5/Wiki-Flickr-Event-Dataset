After multiple games featuring the Dodgers trotting out legends from every era to throw out the first pitch before World Series games at Dodger Stadium, they welcomed back one of the biggest legends of all.

Sandy Koufax, in the house for Game 7!

He was in the stadium to watch Game 6, but it only seems right that the franchise would wait for the biggest stage of all to hand him the ceremonial first pitch ball and let him toss it.

He wasn’t the only one that was in the spotlight for the opening ceremony, though, as Steve Garvey, Don Newcombe, and Rick Monday all participated as well.

If all of these guys weren’t such awesome parts of the franchise, and just baseball legends in general, we might accuse the Dodgers of showing off all of their super cool past players a little too much. But if you’re not going to do that in Game 7 of the World Series, when you have the chance to win your first one in 29 years, then when are you going to do it?

We can’t blame them.

Koufax threw to Garvey, and Newcombe threw to Monday, and all in all it was a great moment to kick off the festivities, and the stress, of the last game of the season.
