So who will have home-field advantage in this year's Fall Classic?
By way of reminder, no longer is home-field advantage in the World Series determined by the outcome of the All-Star Game (the AL won this year).
This year best overall record belongs to the Dodgers, and as such they'll have home-field advantage in the World Series regardless of their opponent.
So Dodger Stadium would host World Series Games 1 and 2 and, if necessary, Games 6 and 7.
Game 1 of the 2017 World Series is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 24.
