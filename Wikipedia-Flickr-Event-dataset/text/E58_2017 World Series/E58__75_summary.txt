Waldstein: Justin Verlander is looking good so far, especially with that called third strike breaking ball to Joc Pederson in the second inning.
With the exception of the solo homer he allowed in the third inning, Rich Hill has matched Justin Verlander.
Justin Verlander also struck out, and after George Springer was intentionally walked to load the bases, Hill’s night was over.
Josh Reddick walked to lead things off, which brought up the pitcher’s spot, and Justin Verlander was removed for a pinch-hitter.
Remember, Jansen blew the save in Game 2 in his second inning of work and took the loss in Game 5 when he gave up a run, also in his second inning of work.
