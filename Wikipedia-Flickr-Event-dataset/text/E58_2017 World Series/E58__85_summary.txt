The 2017 World Series will feature the first postseason matchup of two 100-win teams in 40 years, with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros meeting in the Fall Classic.
This is the first World Series matchup between 100-win teams since 1970, when the Baltimore Orioles beat the Cincinnati Reds.
The Dodgers are back in the World Series for the first time since 1988, and itâ€™s their the 19th time overall.
This is the second World Series for the Astros, who also made it in 2005, when they played in the National League team.
Joe Buck and John Smoltz will call the World Series for Fox, along with reporters Tom Verducci and Ken Rosenthal.
