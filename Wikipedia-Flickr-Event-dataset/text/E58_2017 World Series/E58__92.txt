For a non-traditional matchup with no real hook for casual fans, 2017 World Series ratings have far exceeded expectations.

Friday’s Dodgers-Astros World Series Game 3 had an 8.8 rating and 15.7 million viewers, per Nielsen fast-nationals — down 20% in ratings and 19% in viewership from Indians-Cubs last year (11.0, 19.4M) but up 11% and 19% respectively from Royals-Mets in 2015 (7.9, 13.2M).

The Astros’ win, which peaked with 17.4 million viewers from Midnight ET through the conclusion, was the second-most watched Game 3 of the World Series since White Sox-Astros in 2005 (16.7M). Last year holds the top spot.

It also delivered the third-highest Game 3 rating since Tigers-Cardinals in 2006 (10.2), behind last year and Yankees-Phillies in 2009 (9.1).

Keep in mind Game 3 aired on a Saturday night from 2007-13, typically the lowest rated night of the World Series.

Viewership has now increased for each successive game of the World Series, climbing from 15.0 to 15.5 to 15.7 million. Astros-Dodgers is the first World Series since 1999 to post successive growth over the first three games.

Game 3 had 380,000 viewers on Fox Deportes and 125,000 on Fox Sports GO, bringing the total up to 16.2 million. That marks an 18% decline from last year (19.8M), slightly narrower than the 19% decline on FOX alone. For all three games this series, adding in Spanish-language and streaming viewership has narrowed the year-over-year decline.
