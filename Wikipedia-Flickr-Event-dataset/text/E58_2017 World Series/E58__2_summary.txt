Google is putting YouTube TV, its $35-per-month internet skinny bundle, into the top pitching spot for this year’s World Series.
In addition, YouTube TV is expected to incorporate MLB players competing in postseason play in its promo efforts.
YouTube TV lacks a swath of cable networks, including those from Turner, Viacom, Discovery Communications and Scripps Networks Interactive.
Google and MLB positioned the new World Series deal as building on their long-standing partnership.
