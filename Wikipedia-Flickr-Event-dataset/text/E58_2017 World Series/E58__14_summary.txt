The Dodgers punched their ticket to the World Series on Thursday night, and the Astros followed suit with a win of their own on Saturday in Houston.
The last time the World Series featured two 100-win teams was 1970, when the Orioles beat the Reds.
The World Series starts Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium.
