Though well short of last year’s historic juggernaut, World Series Game 7 ratings were still massive on FOX.
ADVERTISEMENTThe Astros’ title-clinching win trails only last year’s Game 7 as the highest rated and most-watched Major League Baseball game since 2004 (BOS-STL Game 4: 18.2, 28.8M).
The 8.2 is the second-highest for a baseball game since Red Sox-Cardinals Game 4 in 2004 (10.0).
For previous World Series Game 7 ratings, archives dating back to 1972 are available here.
