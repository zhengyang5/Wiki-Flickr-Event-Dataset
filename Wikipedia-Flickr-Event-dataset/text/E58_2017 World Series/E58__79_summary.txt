Another significant drought will end at Dodger Stadium, which has never hosted a World Series Game 7 in its storied history.

Los Angeles will attempt to become the 23rd team to rally from a 3-2 deficit to win the World Series.
The winning league in the All-Star Game was given home-field advantage in the World Series from 2003-16 before the change.
