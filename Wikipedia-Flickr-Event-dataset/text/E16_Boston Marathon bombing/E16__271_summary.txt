Former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) said Monday that the response of law enforcement officials to the Boston Marathon bombings should frighten Americans more than the attack itself.
The ostensible reason for the military-style takeover of parts of Boston was that the accused perpetrator of a horrific crime was on the loose.
Tamerlan was killed early Friday, but Dzhokhar managed to escape, prompting the authorities' request that residents stay indoors and largely shutting down the city.
Deval Patrick (D) and state police have since defended their decision to shut down Boston and some area municipalities during the manhunt.
But Paul said the reaction was a violation of civil liberties, not to mention unsuccessful, since Dzhokhar was discovered by a resident after the stay indoors request had been lifted.
