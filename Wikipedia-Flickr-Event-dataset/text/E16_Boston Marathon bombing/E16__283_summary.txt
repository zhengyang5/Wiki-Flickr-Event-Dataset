The family of missing Brown University student Sunil Tripathi, whose name was repeatedly blasted across social media as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing, said it has been emotionally staggered by the erroneous reports.
"It seems this is just the ugly underbelly of viral social media," Sangeeta Tripathi said.
The Tripathi family said it has no information corroborating that Boston police mentioned Tripathi's name.
