The two were college friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
Dias Kadyrbayev, 19, and Azamat Tazhayakov, 19, both citizens of Kazakhstan living in New Bedford, Mass., on student visas, were charged Thursday with conspiring to obstruct justice and obstructing justice with the intent to impede the Boston Marathon bombing investigation.
Both men will be formally charged in federal court in Boston on Tuesday, said Christina Sterling, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney.
Tsarnaev, 19, pleaded not guilty on July 10 to 30 criminal counts that include using a weapon of mass destruction to commit murder.
