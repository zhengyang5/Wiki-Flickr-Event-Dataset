Two of Boston’s major-league sports teams scrubbed games in response to the fatal explosions Monday near the Boston Marathon finish line.
The National Hockey League’s Boston Bruins postponed Monday’s game against the Ottawa Senators and the National Basketball Association’s Boston Celtics cancelled Tuesday’s scheduled contest with the Indiana Pacers.
“After consultation with city, state and NHL officials we collectively made the decision to postpone tonight’s game.
Further complicating matters is the Celtics, who share TD Garden with the Bruins and have qualified for the NBA playoffs, which begin this weekend.
There was no immediate word on the team site about their next home game, Friday against the Kansas City Royals.
