Doctors today described objects “clearly designed to be projectiles” removed from patients injured in yesterday’s Marathon explosions.
Ten of them are in critical condition, and three others are in three serious, said BMC trauma surgeon Dr. Tracey Dechert.
The 5-year-old is in critical condition.
At the Brigham, nine went to the operating room, five in critical condition.
Two other patients have “threatened limbs.” The patients are being watched very closely by trauma surgeons and nurses.
