"Dzhokhar, if you are alive, turn yourself in and ask for forgiveness," Mr Tsarni said.

The two suspects in the bombing killed a university police officer and hurled explosives at police in a car chase and gun battle overnight that left one of them dead and his brother, Dzhokhar, on the loose.

Thousands of officers swarmed the streets on Friday in a manhunt that all but paralysed the Boston area.

The suspects were identified by law enforcement officials and a family member as Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, ethnic Chechen brothers from Dagestan, which neighbors Chechnya in southern Russia.

They lived near Boston and had been in the US for about a decade, their uncle said.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a 26-year-old who had been known to the FBI as Suspect No 1 and was seen in surveillance footage in a black baseball cap, was killed overnight, officials said.

Dzhokhar, 19 - dubbed Suspect No 2 and seen wearing a white, backward baseball cap in the images from Monday's deadly bombing at the marathon finish line - escaped.

Mr Tsarni said he has not seen them for several years.

He said the family was ashamed, and that he loves and respects the US.

The suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev, said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from the Russian city of Makhachkala that his younger son, Dzhokhar, is "a true angel."

"Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the US He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here," the father said.
