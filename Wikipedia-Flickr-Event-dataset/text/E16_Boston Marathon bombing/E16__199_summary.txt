Dee DeQuattroddequattro@abc6.comTwo men that were brought in for questioning on Friday regarding Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a student at UMass Dartmouth, were arrested again on Saturday for immigration charges.
On Friday, two men and one woman were cuffed and taken in by police for questioning.
On Saturday, police returned to the apartment complex where the three lived and arrested two men on immigration charges.
Neighbors say the two men were the same two men that were taken into custody on Friday.
It is unclear what the men's connection to Tsarnaev is or if the second arrests were in anyway connected to the terror suspect.
