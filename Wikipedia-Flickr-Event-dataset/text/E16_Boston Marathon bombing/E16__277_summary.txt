Authorities say they have photos of two men who are being sought in connection to the Boston marathon bombing, but they’re not the same two men on the cover of Thursday’s New York Post, which previously mis-reported that police had a Saudi national in custody as a suspect.
The Post‘s latest comes immediately following a report of a Saudi national the paper said was being held as a “suspect” in the bombing.
The man turned out to be a witness who was questioned about what he saw, and Boston police subsequently denied the report.
Despite the apparent confusion, the Post stuck by its story, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN and other outlets that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody.
Authorities are expected to release an image of two people of interest later Thursday.
