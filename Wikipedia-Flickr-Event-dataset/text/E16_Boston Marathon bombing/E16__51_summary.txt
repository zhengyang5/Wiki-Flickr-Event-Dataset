UCSD professor says Boston Marathon was ‘lone wolf’ terrorismThe two young brothers suspected of exploding a pair of bombs at the Boston Marathon’s finish line and fatally shooting a police officer and wounding another probably acted on their own, a UC San Diego professor said.
Eli Berman, the research director for International Security Studies at UCSD and a professor in the Department of Economics, said the three hallmarksof organized terrorism were absent from the Boston Maraton bombings, which killed three and injured scores of others.
The Boston Marathon had no political or religious significance, there was no claim of responsibility afterward, or rumblings picked up in advance by western intelligence sources, said the professor, who lived in Boston for 10 years.
“It’s called ‘lone wolf’ terrorism — it’s not attached to any organization.’”That type of terrorism is difficult to defend against, especially when carried out by just two people, he said.
Several friends of 19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told CNN that he was “a good guy” who had a lot of friends, wrestled, and did well in school.
