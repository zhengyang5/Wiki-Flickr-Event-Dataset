Law enforcement sources said the Saudi Arabian man who was initially questioned by investigators is not being considered a suspect at this time.
It appears that he was a spectator who was injured in the attack, reports CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton.
Authorities had stressed from the beginning that the man was not a suspect, but was being questioned as part of the overall investigation.
Also Tuesday, law enforcement said the explosives appeared to have been bombs made from explosive materials inside one or more pressure cookers.
A law enforcement official told CBS News that the two bombs that exploded were made to look like discarded property.
