A preliminary examination of the cellphones and computers used by the Tsarnaev brothers has found no indication of an accomplice in the Boston Marathon bombing, according to a U.S. counter-terrorism source briefed on the FBI investigation.
The source stressed that the investigation is ongoing, but bureau officials at this point appear increasingly confident that “nobody else was involved,” said the source.
He told investigators that the brothers read the instructions in Inspire, an online, English-language magazine that terror monitoring groups say al Qaeda began publishing in 2010.
He was interrogated in a Boston hospital bed, where he is recovering from injuries sustained in shootouts during the hunt.
Boston Children’s Hospital said that a 7-year-old girl with leg injuries had been upgraded to serious condition from critical.
