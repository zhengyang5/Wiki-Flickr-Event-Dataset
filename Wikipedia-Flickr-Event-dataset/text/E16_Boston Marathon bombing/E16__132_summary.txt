Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev today broke a two-year silence to apologize for the carnage he and his brother unleashed at the finish line of the marathon in April 2013.
Add Interest“I’d like to now apologize to the victims and survivors," Tsarnaev told a Boston court, hands folded in front of him, his voice low.
Dzhokhar and his brother, the late Tamerlan Tsarnaev, also murdered MIT police officer Sean Collier days later, amid an intense manhunt.
Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police, but Dzhokhar was captured after hiding in a dry-docked boat in a Boston suburb.
He chose death.
