From GoFundMe Patrick and Jessica Downes of Boston each lost a leg in the marathon bombings.
Now, friends are trying to raise funds to help pay for medical care through two top crowdsourcing websites.
And it includes more than $560,000 directed to Boston newlyweds Jessica Kensky Downes and Patrick Downes, who each lost a leg in the blasts.
“Crowdfunding is actually very empowering to the donors and supporters,” said Brad Damphousse, chief executive of GoFundMe, which has raised nearly $1.3 million through its “Believe in Boston” campaigns.
Berger urges people who want to help marathon victims to send money to The One Fund Boston Inc., the charity just formed by Boston Gov.
