In court Monday, Tsarnaev's lawyers said they have not received key evidence from prosecutors yet and have not had enough time to submit a proposal arguing that Tsarnaev does not deserve the death penalty.
Tsarnaev, 20, will be tried on federal charges in connection with the April 15 bombings, which left 3 people dead and more than 200 injured.
Tsarnaev, who is being held at a federal prison medical center outside Boston, was not expected to appear in court.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his 27-year-old brother Tamerlan were both accused of building and planting pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the annual race.
