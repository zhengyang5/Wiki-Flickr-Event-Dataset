On a gorgeous spring day, Lu Lingzi and two fellow Boston University students ventured to the finish line of the Boston Marathon to observe one of the most storied traditions of their adopted city.
Boston University confirmed Wednesday that Lingzi Lu, who was studying mathematics and statistics at the school and was due to receive her graduate degree in 2015, was among the people killed Monday.
(AP)As flowers piled up at makeshift memorials in Boston, Weibo, a Chinese Web site similar to Twitter, lit up with thousands of condolences and digital candles.
Lu was fluent in English, according to a UCR spokeswoman, and several students in her program continued onto Boston University.
“She was sweet and nice,” said Lu Zhang, a fellow graduate student who had trouble speaking about Lu without becoming emotional.
