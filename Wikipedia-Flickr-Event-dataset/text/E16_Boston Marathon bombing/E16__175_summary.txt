Waltham police have stepped up their investigation of a 2011 triple homicide where a friend of suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was brutally murdered, according to a relative of one of the victims who was interviewed by the Globe.
Investigators probing the Marathon bombings have said Tamerlan visited Chechnya and neighboring Dagestan for six months following the date of the Waltham murders.
Two years ago, the Globe reported that each of the victims had their throats slit.
And friends of the victims have said their bodies were left covered with marijuana, according to the relative who was interviewed by the Globe.
Waltham police today referred questions from the Globe to the Middlesex district attorneyâ€™s office.
