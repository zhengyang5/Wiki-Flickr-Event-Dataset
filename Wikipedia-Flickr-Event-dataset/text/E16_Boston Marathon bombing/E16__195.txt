The moment one woman and two men were taken into custody over Boston bombings near Dartmouth campus where suspect studied

Shortly before authorities arrested Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in Watertown Friday night, the FBI took into custody three others in connection with their investigation.

Two women and one man, both of whom appeared to be college-aged, were apprehended from the Hidden Brook Apartments on Carriage Drive in New Bedford.



The FBI said they were all questioned and later released and that they were never booked into jail.

Clues: The three were apprehended after the FBI conducted a search warrant on an apartment at the complex

New Bedford Police Dept. Lt. Robert Richard said they were not under arrest, though pictures from the scene showed them being led away in handcuffs.



The Massachusetts State Police Department has not responded to an inquiry on the arrests.



The three were apprehended after the FBI conducted a search warrant on an apartment at the complex, which is about 10 minutes from the Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar, 19, was a student.

Neighbors told the local ABC affiliate that Dzhokhar's girlfriend may have lived in the apartment complex and some reported seeing him in the area following the bombings at the marathon, which killed three people and injured more than 170.
