Bombers who killed three people at the Boston Marathon Monday used a pressure cooker pot that's widely available for as little as $140 from major retail stores to house at least one of the explosives, officials told ABC News.
Investigators said Tuesday they had recovered a mangled Fagor brand pressure cooker pot, shrapnel, a circuit board and wiring from what they said was a partially exploded device near the finish line.
"They [investigators] may be able to trace back a pressure cooker."
Two bombs exploded Monday, but investigators said there was not enough evidence to determine if the second bomb was also built from a pressure cooker.
