"I don't have a single American friend, I don't understand them." That's how now-deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev apparently described his social situation to Johannes Hirn, who published a photo essay about Tsarnaev eerily called, "Will Box for Passport." Tsarnaev, 26, cut a pretty beefy profile, reportedly weighing in at 196 pounds while practicing his uppercuts and jabs at the Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts Center. He seemed clean-cut, too. "God said no alcohol," Tsarnaev apparently said, adding that he no longer smoked or drank. "There are no values anymore," he said. "People can't control themselves." [Source] [Source]
