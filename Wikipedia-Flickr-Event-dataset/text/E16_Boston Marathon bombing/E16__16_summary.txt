The manhunt lasted several days, ending in Watertown, Massachusetts, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat in a homeownerâ€™s backyard.
At the time of the bombing, Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, majoring in marine biology.
Last week, the FBI released notes on a 2011 interview with Tamerlan Tsarnaev during which he eschewed violence and said he wanted to become a professional boxer.
