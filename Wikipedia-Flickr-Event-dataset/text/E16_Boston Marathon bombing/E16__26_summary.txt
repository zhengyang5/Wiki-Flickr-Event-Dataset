Scenes from the Boston Marathon bombingChaos ensued at the finish line of the Boston Marathon when two bombs exploded on Monday afternoon, injuring dozens and killing several.
The day began as a beautiful, sun-filled, and joyful time as runners completed the 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton to Boston.
Seconds later, another explosion rocked the street several blocks away from the finish line.
To reach the injured, bystanders had to tear down a makeshift fence that had been built for the marathon.
Former Patriots offensive lineman Joe Andruzzi carried an injured woman away from the scene.
