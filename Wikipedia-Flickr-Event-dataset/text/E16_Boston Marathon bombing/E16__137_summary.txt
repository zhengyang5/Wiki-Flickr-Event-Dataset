(CBS News) Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left a note claiming responsibility for the April 15 attack on the Boston Marathon, reports CBS News senior correspondent John Miller.
Sources tell Miller that Tsarnaev wrote the note in the boat he was hiding in as police pursued him, and as he bled from gunshot wounds sustained in an earlier shootout between police and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
It reads as part manifesto, part suicide note and part justification for the killing and maiming of innocent civilians.
The suspects didn't plan to stop after the Boston bombings, authorities say.
So as Tsarnaev lay in the boat, he wanted to leave a message behind clearly supporting what the note says he and his brother had just done.
