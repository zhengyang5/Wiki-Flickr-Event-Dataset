The number rose because dozens of victims delayed seeking medical care for minor wounds or symptoms that they thought would go away on their own, said Nick Martin, a spokesman for the health commission.
He said the latest data, compiled Saturday by state health officials, show patients were seen at 27 hospitals in Greater Boston.
The 7-year-old girl remains in intensive care and had surgery last week for extensive leg injuries.
Hospitals have somewhat different standards for “critical” patients, those with the most life-threatening set of medical circumstances.
Many of the victims arrived at hospitals with belts and other improvised tourniquets to slow bleeding.
