Confessed murderer Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will now be the one pleading for his life after a federal jury took just 11 hours to find him guilty of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and aftermath that left four dead and 260 maimed and injured.

“I’m grateful for the outcome,” said Liz Norden, the mother of brothers J.P. and Paul Norden who each lost a leg in the bombing, outside the courthouse. “Justice would be the death penalty.”
