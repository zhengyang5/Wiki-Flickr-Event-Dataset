Boston bombing suspect charged, questionedDzhokhar Tsarnaev is said to be cooperative, although he can barely speak.
A prosecutor and an assistant federal defender representing Tsarnaev — who said he had spoken "very briefly" to his client — stood by.
Appearing at the bedside of the grievously wounded 19-year-old, a federal magistrate read the criminal charges against him and advised him of his legal rights.
As investigators tried to unravel the possible motives of the bombing suspects and trace their recent activities, the search for clues fanned out well beyond Boston.
(The elder Tsarnaev died Friday after a firefight with police in the Boston suburb of Watertown.)
