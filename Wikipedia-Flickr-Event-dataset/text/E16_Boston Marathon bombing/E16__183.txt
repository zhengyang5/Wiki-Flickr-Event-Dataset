Boston police commissioner Edward Davis denied reports a suspect is being held after the bombing at the Boston Marathon.

“Those reports are not true, there is no suspect in custody,” Davis said at a press conference.

The FBI’s national press office declined to comment when asked by TPM whether a suspect or person of interest had been identified.
