A federal judge has delayed the sentencing of two friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev because their cases could be affected by a legal question pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The high court Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case that could define what can be considered "tangible" evidence in an obstruction of justice case.
Federal prosecutors applied a certain provision of obstruction of justice laws for the destruction of "any record, document or tangible object" to obstruct an investigation.
Yates' attorneys argued that there are no paper documents or similar "tangible" documents related to his case.
Tsarnaev's backpack contained a thumb drive, but Tazhayakov's lawyers successfully argued at trial that there was no evidence Tazhayakov knew the backpack contained the thumb drive.
