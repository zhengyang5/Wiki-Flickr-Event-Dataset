NEW BEDFORD â€” Police say three people have been taken into custody for questioning at a housing complex where the younger Boston Marathon bombing suspect may have lived.

New Bedford Police Lt. Robert Richard says a private complex of off-campus housing at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth was searched by federal authorities Friday evening.

Richard says the FBI took two males and one female into custody for questioning.

He says 19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have resided at or was affiliated with the housing complex. He is registered at the school.

Authorities say Tsarnaev was apprehended after a manhunt Friday that paralyzed the Boston area.
