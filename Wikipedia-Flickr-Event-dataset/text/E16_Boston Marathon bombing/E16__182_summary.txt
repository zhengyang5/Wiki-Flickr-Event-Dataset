A scheduled 7 p.m. press conference was delayed until later in the evening to allow FBI agents to participate alongside Boston police.
At a press conference just before 6 p.m., Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis denied early press reports that there was a suspect in custody.
Fox News reports that Boston police are guarding a "person of interest" at a local hospital.
"We are methodically going through the area" around the explosions, Davis said, searching for any other bomb materials.
The Boston Globe reports that the young victim was a boy.
