BOSTON, May 9 (By Beverly Ford for RIA Novosti) - Wearing a bright orange prison jumpsuit, Boston marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev spends 23 hours a day alone inside a small cell in a high security housing unit at a federal medical detention center in Devens, Massachusetts, according to a prison spokesman.
Tsarnaev has had no visitors other than his lawyers since being moved to the prison hospital nearly two weeks ago.
"He has to request who he wants to visit and he must have known them prior to incarceration," Colautti said.
There is no television or computer access in the high security unit where Dzhokhar is housed, said Colautti.
