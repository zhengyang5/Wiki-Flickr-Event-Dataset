The shaggy 19-year-old accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing with his older brother "appears calm" in a panicked crowd, federal prosecutors allege in a criminal complaint filed Monday.
The complaint offers new details about last week's bombing and reveals that the suspect Dzokhar Tsarnaev has multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hand.
If convicted of the federal charges, Tsarnaev could face the death penalty.
The criminal complaint against Tsarnaev, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Chechen ethnicity living in Cambridge, Mass., includes sworn statements from an FBI agent.
The stolen car, reportedly a Mercedes SUV, was spotted by police soon after the carjacking in nearby Watertown.
