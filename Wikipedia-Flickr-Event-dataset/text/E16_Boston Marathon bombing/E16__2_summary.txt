The 19-year-old suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings has told interrogators that the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan motivated him and his brother to carry out the attack, according to U.S. officials familiar with the interviews.
The first successful large-scale bombing in the post-Sept. 11, 2001, era, the Boston attack killed three people and wounded more than 250 others.
U.S. officials said they sought follow-up information from Russia, but that Moscow failed to respond.
Officials also expressed skepticism that Russian authorities were concerned about the elder Tsarnaevâ€™s contacts during his trip to Russia.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged Monday with using a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property, counts that could carry the death penalty if convicted.
