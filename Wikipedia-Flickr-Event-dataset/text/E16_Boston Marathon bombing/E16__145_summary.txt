Defense lawyers for accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev say the FBI had asked his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, to inform on Boston's Chechen and Muslim community.
Prosecutors say they found no evidence that Tamerlan was solicited by the government to be an informant.
Defense attorneys insist prosecutors have that evidence, and are asking a judge to force them to turn it over.
Defense attorneys argue in the same letter that Tamerlan may have misinterpreted the visits, calling the discussions a "stressor that increased his paranoia and distress."
In addition to information about visits from the FBI, defense lawyers are asking for all documents from the interview with Ibragim Todashev, in which he allegedly admitted to participating alongside Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a gruesome triple murder in Waltham in 2011.
