Ramzan Kadyrov, the ruthless leader of Chechnya, took to Instragam on Friday to respond to the identification of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings as Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Kadyrov sought to distance his republic from the suspects.

The brothers are said by friends and family to have been of Chechen descent and to have grown up in Kyrgyzstan, but there is no established link between the suspects and the political situation in Chechnya. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot by police on Thursday night, and later died in hospital; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is currently the subject on a manhunt which has seen the city of Boston placed on lockdown.

Kadyrov wrote: "Tragic events happened in Boston. As a result of a terrorist attack, people were killed. We already expressed our condolences to the residents of the city and to the people of America.

"Today, as the media report, a certain Tsarnaev was killed during a detention attempt. It would be logical if he was detained and an investigation was conducted, all the circumstances and degree of his guilt explained. Apparently, the special forces needed a result at any price to calm society.

"Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the US, their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole world must battle with terrorism.

"We know this better than anyone. We wish recover to all the victims and share Americans' feeling of sorrow."
