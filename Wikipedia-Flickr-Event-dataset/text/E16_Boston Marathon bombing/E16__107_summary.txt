Hern, 11, was injured during the second bombing on April 15.
Law enforcement officials said they do not believe the brothers were connected with a terrorist organization, but they cautioned that the inquiry is at an early stage.
“They were dealing with an individual who is alleged to have been involved in the bombings at the Boston Marathon.
In spite of these extraordinary factors, they were able to capture this individual alive with no further harm to law enforcement.
“You can’t second-guess what they were doing on that scene,” said a second law enforcement official.
