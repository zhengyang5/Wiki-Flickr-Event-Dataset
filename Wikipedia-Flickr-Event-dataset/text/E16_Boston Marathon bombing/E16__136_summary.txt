FBI agents digging into background of bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev get help from Cambridge, MA Mosque members who knew the suspects as some members of Congress want to learn more about FBI contact with Tamerlan before the bombing.
FBI agents have also begun reviewing the two brothers’ cellphone and email records and so far have found no sign of accomplices -- or connections to international terror groups, said a counterterrorism source who has been briefed on the investigation.
Ruslan Tsarni said he has told the FBI about Mischa.
FBI agents are also trying to determine if there were other influences on Tamerlan Tsarnaev from people he may have met with during a six-month trip to Russia last year — during which he spent time in Chechnya and Dagestan, according to his father.
Vali said that, after Tamerlan Tsarnaev was identified as a suspect in the Boston bombing last week, congregants reported two incidents in which he had disrupted services at the mosque.
