Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who has been described as "very relaxed", appears to be grinning, his dark curls covered by a white baseball cap.
His older brother, Tamerlan, shields his eyes with sunglasses, his mouth slightly open as he stares ahead.
There are conflicting reports in regards to the birth places of the Tsarnaev brothers.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was shot dead by Boston police in the early hours of Friday morning, was born in 1986.
