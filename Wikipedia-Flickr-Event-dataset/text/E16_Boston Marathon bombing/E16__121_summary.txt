CBS News senior correspondent John Miller told CBS Radio News that transferring Tsarnaev gets the hospital out of a delicate situation.
"There were many victims of the Boston bombing in Beth Israel hospital who didn't want to be in the same hospital with one of the people allegedly responsible."
On Thursday, New York officials said Tsarnaev and his older brother and fellow suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev planned to attack Times Square.
Miller told CBSNews.com that the amount of fuel in the car's tank wasn't the major obstacle in the brothers' plan.
On Wednesday, Kelly told reporters that he was told Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have been intending to come to New York to party, or for a party, sometime after the bombings.
