Boston transit cop wounded in firefight with marathon bombers is expected to make full recovery...but doctors have left a bullet in his legThe Boston transit police officer critically wounded in the gun battle with the Boston bombing suspects thanked those who helped his recovery today - as he revealed doctors have left a bullet in his leg.
Donahue revealed that one of the bullets fired will be left inside his leg - as it poses no risk or danger.
'The bullet will remain in my leg as it is not obstructing anything or causing any pain,' said Donahue.
Sadly for Donahue, his friend Sean Collier was shot and killed by Tamerlan and Dzokhar Tsarnaev during the astonishing events of April 19th.
Richard Donahue and the slain MIT officer, Sean Collier, graduated from the police academy together in 2010.
