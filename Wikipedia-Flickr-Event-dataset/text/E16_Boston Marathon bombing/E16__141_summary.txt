An emerging portrait of the brothers accused in the Boston Marathon bombings suggested that the older of the two, ­Tamerlan Tsarnaev, embraced a more radical form of Islam in recent years.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a firefight with police early Friday morning, appeared to sympathize with Islamic extremists agitating for Chechen independence from Russia.
­Rahman described Dzhokhar as a “stoner.”A couple of years ago, neighbors and family said, Tamerlan Tsarnaev seemed to become more religious.
A neighbor said Tamerlan Tsarnaev ­also briefly exchanged his ­urban look for religious dress, a long white robe, and beard.
But he also said the transformation came as soon as it went: Tamerlan Tsarnaev shaved the beard about a month after he grew it.
