Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died early this morning after a shootout with police.
Dzhokar A. Tsarnaev, 19, escaped during a night of mayhem as investigators hunted for him on foot, by vehicle and from the air.
Ruslan Tsarni, the suspects’ uncle in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said his brother’s children immigrated to the U.S. in 2003, arriving in Cambridge.
Agustin Nedina, an 18-year-old from Cambridge who attended middle and high school with Dzhokar Tsarnaev, said he once played computer games at the suspect’s home.
Both brothers attended Cambridge Community Charter School, a public, tuition-free, college-preparatory charter school in the Kendall Square area near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
