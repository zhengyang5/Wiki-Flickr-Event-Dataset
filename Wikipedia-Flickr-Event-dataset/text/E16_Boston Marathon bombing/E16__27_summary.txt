A man rolls his luggage near a police cordon a day after explosions hit the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts on April 16, 2013.
Most said they were weary after the horror that unfolded at the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon on Patriots’ Day, a Massachusetts state holiday.
Even so they wanted to get back to work as a message of defiance to the perpetrators of the attack.
“We are operating business as usual in the majority of our Boston locations,” said State Street spokeswoman Alicia Curran.
“We said, ‘Damn it, We’re open.’ People will come here to learn what the Boston patriots sacrificed for us to give us this freedom.”
