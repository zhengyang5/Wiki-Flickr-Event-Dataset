BOSTON -- Monday's bombings at the 117th Boston Marathon weren't just an attack on Boston, they were a slap at all people, said Ed Starbuck of Nantucket.
"It just touches me to know people put something down to show they care," said Jamie Bursell, who also plans to run Boston next year.
"Just to pay respects to all the folks and pay respects to the town," Noori said.
He was in Boston to watch his wife, Sina, run the marathon with her friend, Amy Bartholomew of Atlanta, in celebration of beating breast cancer.
Rebecca Koskinen of Boston gave birth to her daughter, Elisabeth, on Marathon Monday last year, so it was important to take her to this year's marathon.
