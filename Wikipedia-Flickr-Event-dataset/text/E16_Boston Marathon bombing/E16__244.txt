President Obama ordered flags lowered to half-staff at the White House and federal buildings across the nation Tuesday in honor of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings.

He said in a proclamation that he gave the order as "a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013, in Boston, Massachusetts."

Three people are confirmed dead so far, including 8-year-old Martin Richard. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said there are a total of 176 injured, 17 of them critically.
