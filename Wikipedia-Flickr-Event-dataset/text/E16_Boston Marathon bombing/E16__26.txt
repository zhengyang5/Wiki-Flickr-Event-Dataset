Scenes from the Boston Marathon bombing

Chaos ensued at the finish line of the Boston Marathon when two bombs exploded on Monday afternoon, injuring dozens and killing several.

The day began as a beautiful, sun-filled, and joyful time as runners completed the 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton to Boston.

But the tenor of Marathon Day changed quickly when the first of two successive bombs exploded along Boylston Street just before 3 p.m.

A short time later, the once-joyous finish line scene had become a crime scene under lockdown.

The jolt of the first blast knocked this runner to the ground and prompted police to spring into action.

Seconds later, another explosion rocked the street several blocks away from the finish line.

To reach the injured, bystanders had to tear down a makeshift fence that had been built for the marathon.

Police and marathon officials struggled to remove the barriers.

The blast created a smoky haze that contributed to the confusion that reigned in the ensuing minutes.
