Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis said releasing the photos of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing “may have led to the further attack’’ against MIT police officer Sean Collier, which he called an assassination.
Releasing the pictures after many hours of behind-the-scenes deliberation, “was a turning point in the investigation, no doubt about it,’’ said Davis in an interview with the Globe.
Further violent acts were inevitable.’’ The suspects “were not making those explosives for nothing,’’ said Davis.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was shot during the gun battle and later pronounced dead.
Investigators also believe the suspects are responsible for wounding Transit Police officer Richard H. Donahue Jr. during the gun battle in Watertown early Friday morning.
