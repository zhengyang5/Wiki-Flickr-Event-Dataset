Authorities urged residents in Watertown, Newton, Waltham, Belmont, Cambridge, Arlington and the Allston-Brighton neighborhoods of Boston to stay indoors.
All mass transit was shut down.
The announcement Friday morning comes hours after the killing of one suspect, known as the man in the black hat from marathon surveillance footage.
