Dr. Alok Gupta, who directed the surgical response at Beth Israel, said he often goes to the finish line of the marathon to watch the race.
Seven patients at Beth Israel went directly to the operating room for emergency surgery to stabilize them, stopping bleeding for example.
Most of the injured taken to Beth Israel were no older than 50, said Dr. Michael Yaffe, a trauma surgeon at the hospital.
At about 2 a.m. on Tuesday, the Beth Israel medical team left for home, to return again at 6.
The Boston Marathon is so special, a day to celebrate athleticism and the thrill of the sport.
