Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s College Friend Pleads GuiltyIf a judge accepts the agreement, Dias Kadyrbayev, facing obstruction charges for disposing of Tsarnaev's backpack after the Marathon bombings, will serve a maximum of seven years.
In a major turnaround, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s college friend Dias Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty to charges he obstructed the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings in a court hearing on Thursday.
Despite the serious nature of his charges, Kadyrbayev comes off as a bit of a class clown.
“He did not do so out of malice.” None of the Tsarnaev’s friends facing charges are accused of knowing about the bombing beforehand.
Two additional Tsarnaev friends, Khairullozhon Matanov and Konstantin Morozov, were detained in separate incidents on May 30 of this year.
