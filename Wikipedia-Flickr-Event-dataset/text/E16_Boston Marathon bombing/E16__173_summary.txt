Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was arrested late Friday after he was found hiding in a trailered boat behind a house in Watertown.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a introspective but popular star of the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School wrestling team who won a city-sponsored scholarship to attend college.

In August, after he returned from Russia, Tamerlan Tsarnaev appears to have created a new YouTube account.
