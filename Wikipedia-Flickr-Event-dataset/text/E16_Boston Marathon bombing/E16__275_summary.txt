A few weeks after last year’s Boston Marathon, I asked some questions about the government reaction to the bombing:.
for the sake of argument, let’s assume that there was nothing untoward, unconstitutional or heavy-handed about the police response in Boston, or in Watertown specifically.
So what exactly made Boston different from the D.C. sniper attacks or the bombing in Olympic Park?
The danger here is that the Boston response tightens the ratchet and becomes the default response to similar crises in the future.
If we don’t force a discussion about the tactics used in the aftermath of the Boston bombing, we risk allowing those tactics to become the norm.
