Graham released a statement with several Republican lawmakers.
| John Shinkle/POLITICO Graham: 'Enemy combatant'Several Republican lawmakers are calling for the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings to be tried as an enemy combatant, rather than as an ordinary criminal.
The suspect, based upon his actions, clearly is a good candidate for enemy combatant status.
The lawmakers argued that a criminal trial would move slowly at a time when information is needed fast.
That should be our focus, not a future domestic criminal trial that may take years to complete,‚Äù they said.
