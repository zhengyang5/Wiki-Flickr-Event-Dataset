The parents of the Tsarnaev brothers reached the United States on tourist visas and applied for asylum.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was a southpaw heavyweight boxer who represented New England in the National Golden Gloves and talked about competing on behalf of the United States.
His tangle-haired 19-year-old brother, Dzhokhar, was a skateboarder who listened to rap and seemed easygoing to other kids in his Cambridge, Mass., neighborhood.
Speaking to journalists in Dagestan on Friday, the brothersâ€™ father, Anzor Tsarnaev, said his sons never had any interest in weapons.
Anzor Tsarnaev and his wife successfully applied for asylum status after arriving in the United States in 2002.
