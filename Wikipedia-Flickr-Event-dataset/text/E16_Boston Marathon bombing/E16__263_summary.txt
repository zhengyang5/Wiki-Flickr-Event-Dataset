High-ranking FBI officials faced questioning by US lawmakers on Tuesday over whether they missed red flags surrounding slain Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
The FBI officials briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee in a closed hearing about the investigation around the Boston Marathon bombings – which killed three people and injured 164 others – and the two suspects involved, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19.
After his 2011 FBI interview, Tsarnaev’s name was put into the Treasury Enforcement Communications System, which helps US officials screen individuals arriving to the country.
His brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested the following evening and hospitalized with serious injuries sustained during his attempts to evade capture.
Dzhokhar told investigators that he and his brother did not have co-conspirators in the bombing plot, the New York Times reported.
