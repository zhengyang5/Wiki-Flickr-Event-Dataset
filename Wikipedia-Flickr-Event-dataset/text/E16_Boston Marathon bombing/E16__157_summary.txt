(CNN) Almost two years before carrying out the deadly Boston Marathon bombings, Tamerlan Tsarnaev told FBI agents he had never picked a fight.
"Tamerlan doesn't like to fight for the sake of violence," says an FBI report from the 2011 interview between Tsarnaev and FBI agents.
Tsarnaev told agents that four "young, handsome men in suits" had identified themselves as FBI agents to a family member and said they wanted to speak to Tsarnaev.
That was a misquote, Tsarnaev told FBI agents in 2011, and most of his friends were Americans.
The photographer did not speak good English, Tsarnaev told FBI agents.
