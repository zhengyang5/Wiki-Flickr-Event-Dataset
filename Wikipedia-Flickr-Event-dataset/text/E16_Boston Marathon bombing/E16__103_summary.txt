Boston and Massachusetts State Police got their first look at the Boston Marathon bombing suspect’s hiding place with the help of infrared imaging technology developed in Wilsonville, Oregon.
A Watertown, Massachusetts resident reported he thought the 19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was hiding in a boat in his backyard.
Police used an infrared camera developed by FLIR Systems Inc. to locate him and track his movements.
A helicopter equipped with FLIR — a forward-looking infrared device – picked up the heat signature of the suspect.
Originally the company created the infrared imaging systems to be installed on vehicles for use in conducting energy audits.
