FBI: Boston suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev followed 'radical Islam'Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, came to the U.S. from Russia about a decade ago as ethnic Chechen refugees and were granted asylum, law enforcement sources have said.
Deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was identified by a foreign government as a "follower of radical Islam and a strong believer" whose personality had changed drastically in just a year, according to the FBI.
The alleged outburst occurred at the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge.
The post also has been updated to include comments from a leader of the Cambridge mosque disputing the claim that Tsarnaev had been ejected.]
Anwar Kazmi, a trustee of the Cambridge mosque, said Tamerlan wasn't ejected after the outburst over King, but was talked to later by mosque leaders and calmed down.
