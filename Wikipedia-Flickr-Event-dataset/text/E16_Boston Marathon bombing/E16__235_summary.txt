Crayons are just one tool deployed by six Israeli trauma experts visiting Boston to help form post-attack recovery strategies.
As specialists with the Israel Trauma Coalition for Response and Preparedness (ITC), the team is working with local counterparts until Friday.
In each locale, Rogel helps trauma victims “reclaim” their emotional lives with individual coping plans.
In what is called a “reorganizing conversation,” ITC experts spoke with hospital staff about the experience of treating the bombing suspect.
“The visit of these Israeli trauma specialists has worked out beyond our expectations,” CJP’s president, Barry Shrage, said.
