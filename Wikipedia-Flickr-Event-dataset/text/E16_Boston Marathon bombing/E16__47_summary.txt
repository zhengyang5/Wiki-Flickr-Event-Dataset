Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the elder Boston Marathon bombings suspect, purchased two large mortar kits from a New Hampshire fireworks store less than an hour’s drive from Boston in early February, a Phantom Fireworks official said today.

The store is a popular destination for Bostonians, he said, and offers a buy-one-get-one free deal, which Tsarnaev took advantage of.
Weimer speculated that Tsarnaev extracted the powder from all 48 shells hoping to use it to build his bombs.
The shells contain a mix of clay, one powder to deliver color and noise, and two explosive powders.
