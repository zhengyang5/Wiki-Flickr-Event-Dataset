The police can interrogate a suspect without offering him the benefit of Miranda if he could have information thatâ€™s of urgent concern for public safety.
In the 1984 case New York v. Quarles, the Supreme Court carved out the public safety exception for a man suspected of rape.
So the police asked him where the gun was before reading him his Miranda rights.
He was interrogated without Miranda warnings via the public safety exception, and again, the FBI said it got useful information.
