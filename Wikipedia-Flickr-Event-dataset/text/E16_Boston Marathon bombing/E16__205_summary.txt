One of the college friends of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is slated to complete a federal prison sentence Thursday.
Azamat Tazhayakov, 22, is being held at the minimum security prison in Ashland, Ky.
Robel Phillipos, a US citizen who attended high school with Tsarnaev in Cambridge, was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to investigators.
He is appealing that sentence, and is being held at the federal supermax prison in Colorado.
