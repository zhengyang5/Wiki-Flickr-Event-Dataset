In a joint statement, four lawmakers urge President Obama to treat the Boston bombing suspect picked up last night in Watertown, Mass.
as an “enemy combatant.” Here’s the joint statement, signed by Rep. Peter King, Senators Kelly Ayotte, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham:“We applaud our law enforcement for their hard work and bravery in Boston.
“The suspect, based upon his actions, clearly is a good candidate for enemy combatant status.
“A decision to not read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests.
“We hope the Obama Administration will consider the enemy combatant option because it is allowed by national security statutes and U.S. Supreme Court decisions.
