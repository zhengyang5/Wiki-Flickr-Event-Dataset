BOSTON -- Jurors in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have been shown a dramatic video of a carjacking victim escaping from Tsarnaev and his brother days after the attacks.
The video shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev going inside a gas station convenience store in Cambridge and filling his arms with drinks and snacks.
Then the video shows Dun Meng bolting from a car parked at the gas pumps and running across the street.
Seconds later, a man authorities say is Tamerlan Tsarnaev is seen going to the door of the store.
The video shows a clear view of Dzhokhar's face even though he wearing a hooded sweatshirt.
