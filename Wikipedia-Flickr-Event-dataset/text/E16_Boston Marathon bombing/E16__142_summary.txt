The name of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect was added to a terrorist database by the federal government 18 months before the deadly explosions, it has emerged, adding to pressure on authorities already facing criticism for failing to prevent the deadly attack.
US officials told Associated Press that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was killed in a shootout with the police, was added to a huge classified database of known and suspected terrorists 18 months ago.
About six months earlier, the FBI had separately investigated Tsarnaev, also at Russia's request, but the FBI found no ties to terrorism, officials said.
Officials are investigating Tamerlan Tsarnaev's trip to Russia in 2012 and whether he met extremists during that time.
Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told a Russian news agency that they will fly to the US on Thursday.
