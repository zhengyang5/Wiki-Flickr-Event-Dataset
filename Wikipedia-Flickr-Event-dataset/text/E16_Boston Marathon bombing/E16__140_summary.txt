Mr. Khadzhimuratov, 36, said he understood why investigators would want to take a look at him.
And long before coming to the United States in 2004, Mr. Khadzhimuratov was a bodyguard for Akhmed Zakayev, a prominent secular Chechen separatist leader who now lives in London.
But Mr. Khadzhimuratov said he had been rattled by the growing intensity of the F.B.I.
He said the visit from Mr. Tsarnaev in March, when they drank tea and talked about family, was like their handful of previous meetings.
“We have nothing to hide,” said Mr. Khadzhimuratov, who has not hired a lawyer.
