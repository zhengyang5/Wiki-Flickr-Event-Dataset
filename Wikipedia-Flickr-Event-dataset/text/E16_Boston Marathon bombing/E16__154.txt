Authorities are now confirming the two suspects sought in Monday's Boston Marathon bombing are two Russian-born (as reported by the AP) Chechen brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev. Tamerlan, the older brother, is dead. Here's what we know about him.

It's not much, and most of it's derived from a photo gallery for a 2010 article in the Boston University graduate school magazine. [Update, 3:20 p.m.: We've removed the photos at Landov Media's request.] We know Tamerlan Tsarnaev was 26 and a competitive boxer for a club named Team Lowell. He won the Rocky Marciano Trophy for being New England Golden Gloves heavyweight champion in 2010, and did this while taking time off from school at Bunker Hill Community College where he studied in hopes of being an engineer. He's been boxing in the U.S. since at least 2004, and his uncle told WBZ in Boston that he arrived in the United States in 2000 under refugee status from Kyrgyzstan.

The Lowell Sun wrote this about his bout at the Golden Gloves nationals in 2009:

In Team New England's last bout of the night, Tamerlan Tsarnaev dropped a controversial decision to Lamar Fenner of Chicago in the 201-pound devision. After flooring Fenner with a huge punch that required an eight count, it seemed that Tsarnaev was in control of the whole fight. Yet somehow the judges saw it differently and awarded Fenner the decision, a decision that drew boos from the crowd. Team New England finished the first day of action with two wins and two losses.

We know he had a YouTube profile, where he created a playlist dedicated to terrorism. The photo gallery features his girlfriend at the time, and the caption reads:

Tamerlan says his girlfriend is half Portuguese, half Italian girlfriend and converted to Islam: "She's beautiful, man!"
