Story highlights Boston Marathon bombs seem to follow widely available recipe, experts say"Lone wolf" devices worry the intelligence community because there's "no trail, no intelligence"Al Qaeda, U.S. right-wing extremists use hard-to-trace bombs, experts sayThe devices used in the Boston Marathon attack Monday are typical of the "lone wolf:" the solo terrorist who builds a bomb on his own by following a widely available formula.
"This is what you worry about the most," a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN's Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger.
U.S. Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said "most likely gun powder" was used in the devices.
There is no evidence that AQAP or any of its supporters was involved in the Boston attack.
Like the bombings in Boston, those devices were concealed in a backpack, according to a Department of Homeland Security report detailing the 1996 attack.
