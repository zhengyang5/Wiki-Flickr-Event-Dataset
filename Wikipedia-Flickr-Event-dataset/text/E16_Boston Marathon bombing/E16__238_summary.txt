BOSTON -- The Red Sox and Bruins postponed their Friday night games, hours before police in Boston took the second suspect in Monday's marathon bombings into custody following a long manhunt in the city.
The Red Sox were set to play the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park; the Pittsburgh Penguins were in town to play the Bruins at TD Garden.
The Red Sox have swept Fenway Park for possible bombs, team COO Sam Kennedy told ESPNBoston.com in an email.
Boston police initially announced the postponement of the Bruins game, which has been rescheduled for 12:30 p.m.
The Bruins game was rescheduled for April 28.
