OKLAHOMA CITY - The horrific events that unfolded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon have rattled everyone across the country, especially for Oklahomans as we prepare for the Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon.

It is an event that takes places each year to remember another tragedy that took place in Oklahoma on April 19, 1995.

Oklahomans are gearing up for the Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon to honor not only lives lost in the Alfred P. Murrah building bombing but the Boston Marathon bombing, as well.

"I was thinking of ways that all participants in the Oklahoma City marathon could show their support for everyone in Boston," Andrea Miles said. "I came up with red socks for Boston. It's iconic, and you think of the Boston Red Sox."

Soon red socks will take on a very profound and powerful message.

"As Oklahomans and folks participating in the OKC Memorial Marathon, we have such a deep connection to not only the marathon but the events from the Murrah bombing that have lead to this memorial," Miles said. "So now we're not just running to remember the 168 people who were lost in 1995 but also to honor Boston and stand in solidarity with them."

A sea of red support representing unity among courses run hundreds of miles apart for tragedies that happened nearly two decades apart.

"What an incredible visual to see so many people running and walking in red socks. In a way, it's like we're all coming together," Miles said. "This event is all about coming together and a community rising to be stronger than a terrible tragic attack."

Miles said several area running stores are stocking up on red socks for the event.

She hopes to have a Facebook page up very soon under the name "Boston Red Socks" with more information.
