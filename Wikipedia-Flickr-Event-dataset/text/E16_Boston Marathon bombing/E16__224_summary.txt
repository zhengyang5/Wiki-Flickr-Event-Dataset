BOSTON Remarkably, all of the more than 180 people injured in the Boston Marathon blasts one week ago who made it to a hospital alive now seem likely to survive, doctors say.
"All I feel is joy," said Dr. George Velmahos, chief of trauma surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, referring to his hospital's 31 blast patients.
Two children with leg injuries remain hospitalized at Boston Children's Hospital.
Doctors and emergency responders approach each patient as someone who can be saved regardless of how severe the injuries appear.
At Boston Children's Hospital, since many employees were either attending the marathon or living close by, doctors and other medical professionals had arrived at the hospital even before their phone rang.
