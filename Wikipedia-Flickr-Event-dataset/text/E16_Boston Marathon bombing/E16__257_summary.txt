VANCOUVER - The Vancouver Sun Run will donate $10 from every late entry for Sunday's race to help victims of the bombings at the Boston Marathon.
The fee for those who register late goes up by $10 to $60, but the plan is to donate that $10 from every late entry to the Boston bombing victims, said Jamie Pitblado, vice-president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province.
He said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that's collecting donations for the victims and their families.
If a surge in registration continues, Sun Run organizers could raise anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000.
Runners will start the race Sunday morning with an official tribute to Boston, although Pitblado said organizers are still working out the details.
