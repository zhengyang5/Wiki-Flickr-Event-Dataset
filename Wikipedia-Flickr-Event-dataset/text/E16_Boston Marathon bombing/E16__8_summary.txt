I am the special agent in charge of the Boston Division of the FBI.
Our collective law enforcement team has pursued thousands leads and tips.
As you can see from one of the images, Suspects 1 and 2 appear to be walking together through the marathon crowd on Boylston Street in the direction of the finish line.
No one should attempt to apprehend them except law enforcement.
If you see these men, contact law enforcement.
