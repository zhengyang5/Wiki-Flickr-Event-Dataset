WATERTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Police are locking down some neighborhoods in Boston and its western suburbs as they search for the remaining suspect in the marathon bombings.

Authorities urged residents in Watertown, Newton, Waltham, Belmont, Cambridge, Arlington and the Allston-Brighton neighborhoods of Boston to stay indoors. All mass transit was shut down.

At least a quarter of a million people live in those suburbs. Many people in the city of Boston and surrounding areas rely on the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority to get to work.

The announcement Friday morning comes hours after the killing of one suspect, known as the man in the black hat from marathon surveillance footage. The man in the white hat is on the loose and police are calling him a "terrorist" who came here "to kill."
