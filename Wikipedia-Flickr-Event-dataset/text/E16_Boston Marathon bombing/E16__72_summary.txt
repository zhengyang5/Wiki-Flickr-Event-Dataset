Police “pinged” the phone to determine where it was, he said, which alerted police that the suspects were in Watertown.
A husky man – apparently Tamerlan Tsarnaev — stood nearby firing a gun.
Deveau said the Tsarnaev brothers hurled something at the officers – apparently a pressure cooker bomb — and there was a tremendous explosion.
After several minutes, the elder brother, Tamerlan, walked toward the officers, firing his gun until he appeared to run out of bullets, Deveau said.
The officers scattered and the SUV plowed over Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was dragged briefly under the car, he said.
