WATERTOWN, Massachusetts (Reuters) - Gunfire was heard on Friday night as dozens of police cars and armored vehicles converged on a street in a Boston suburb in the manhunt for the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, witnesses said.
An ethnic Chechen suspected in the Boston bombings is the target of a day-long manhunt that virtually shut down the city.
The surviving suspect escaped on foot.
Police SWAT team members run towards a police assault on a house as gunfire erupts on Franklin Street during the search for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, in Watertown, Massachusetts April 19, 2013.
In separate interviews, the parents of the Tsarnaev brothers said they believed their sons were incapable of carrying out the bombings.
