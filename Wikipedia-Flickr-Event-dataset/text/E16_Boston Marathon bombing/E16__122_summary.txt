The Boston Marathon bombing suspect is being held in a small cell with a steel door at a federal medical detention center about 40 miles outside the city, a federal official said Saturday.
Tsarnaev was injured during a police chase Thursday in which his brother, also a suspect in the bombing, was fatally wounded.
His cell has a solid steel door with an observation window and a slot for passing food and medication.
In another conversation, the mother of now-dead bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was recorded talking to someone in southern Russia who is under FBI investigation in an unrelated case, officials told The Associated Press.
On Saturday, authorities ended their two-day search of a landfill 60 miles south of Boston, near where Dzokhar attended college.
