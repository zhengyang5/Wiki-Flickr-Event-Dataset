Attorneys from the Massachusetts chapter of the National Lawyers Guild hosted a forum Thursday in Watertown about the home searches that took place there on April 19.
The discussion in Watertown last night, which guild leaders said was attended by about 30 people, was one in a series on the subject.
Top lawyers in the guild said that there was an unprecedented show of force in Watertown, Cambridge, and other area communities, and that many houses in Watertown were searched without a warrant.
âThe widespread searches of many Watertown homes without any individualized suspicion have no constitutional precedent," Falkner said in a statement.
and 'What is the level of militarization of police force, and in what situations will this force be used?'"
