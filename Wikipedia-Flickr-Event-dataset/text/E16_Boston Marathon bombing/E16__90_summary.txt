Officials in Watertown have been fielding calls all day, but say they have little information to offer residents who have been asking whatâs going on.
âThe calls Iâve been getting this afternoon are from people concerned that we donât have a suspect in custody,â Sideris said.
Although he has been in regular communication with Town Manager Michael Driscoll all day, Sideris said he does not know any more than he did this morning.
At a midday press conference, Watertown police chief Edward Deveau thanked residents for their cooperation and urged patience.
An armored transport vehicle and an SUV slowly rolled down the street, Kounelis added, stopping in front of each residence while a search was conducted.
