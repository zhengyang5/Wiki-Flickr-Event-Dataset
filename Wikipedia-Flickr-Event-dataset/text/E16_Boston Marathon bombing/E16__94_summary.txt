The following information is being sent to all Somerville residents after careful and ongoing discussions with law enforcement personnel, and will be updated as necessary throughout the day.
Due to an ongoing manhunt in the Boston area, state authorities have shut down the MBTA and issued a shelter-in-place advisory for a number of surrounding towns.
At the time, Somerville has NOT been included in the advisory, but we ask that Somerville residents observe the shelter-in-place advisory if they can.
Again, authorities consider the City of Somerville to be safe and NOT under any immediate threat.
For updates, please refer to the Boston news media, or to the City Facebook and Twitter feeds.
