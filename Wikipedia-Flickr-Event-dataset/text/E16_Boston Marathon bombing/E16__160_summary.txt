Terrorist Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the country recently and returned a radically different man, according to a Boston man who knew both brothers.
WNBC-TV reported Friday that Tamerlan was out of the country for about six months last year.
He left via Kennedy Airport in January 2012 and returned in July, the news outlet said.
Family and friends say that they saw a dramatic rise in Tamerlan’s religious fervor dating to 2009 — and that he only got more radical as time passed.
He wasn’t the same at all.”Tamerlan was no stranger to tragedy, but its possible effect on his radicalization remains unclear.
