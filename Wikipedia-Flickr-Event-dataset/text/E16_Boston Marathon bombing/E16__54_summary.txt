Two and a half minutes later, the bag exploded, shredding Bauman's legs.
"He woke up under so much drugs, asked for a paper and pen and wrote, 'bag, saw the guy, looked right at me,'" Chris Bauman told Bloomberg News.
Bauman was rushed to Boston Medical Center, where both his legs were amputated from the knee down.
The man, identified as Carlos Arredondo, used some pieces of cloth to tie tourniquets around Bauman's mangled legs before getting him onto a wheelchair.
He was reportedly at the marathon to support "Tough Ruckers" â€“ a group that runs in full military gear to honor fallen comrades.
