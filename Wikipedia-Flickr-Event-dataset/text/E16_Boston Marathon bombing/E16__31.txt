The American Red Cross issued the following statement on the explosions at the Boston Marathon:

Our hearts go out to all those in Boston dealing with this tragedy and our thoughts are with all of those injured.

The Red Cross has sent more than 100 additional blood products to several Boston area hospitals to help meet patient needs. Thanks to the generosity of volunteer blood donors, there is currently enough blood on the shelves to meet demand. People can call 1-800-RED CROSS or go to redcrossblood.org to schedule an appointment to give blood in the days and weeks ahead.

Right now, many people are concerned about loved ones in Boston, and it is important for people to connect with one another. People in Boston who have access to a computer can go to redcross.org/safeandwell to list themselves as safe or they can text or call a family member and ask to be registered on the site. Please note that due to high volume, the Safe and Well site is experiencing slow page loads at this time. Please be patient and continue to check back.

Over the next few hours, the Red Cross will be working in close coordination with officials to determine how we can best help the community and support emergency workers.

Many Red Cross volunteers and workers were on the marathon course, as they are every year to support the runners. Communication in the area is difficult and we are working right now to reconnect with those workers.
