Former NFL offensive lineman Joe Andruzzi, a cancer survivor, runs a foundation that raises funds to assist cancer patients and to support pediatric brain cancer research.

As part of the effort, Andruzzi organizes a team of runners every year at the Boston Marathon.

He has three brothers who responded to the 9/11 attacks, so it makes sense that he’d be photographed carrying a woman who had been injured in Monday’s bombing.
