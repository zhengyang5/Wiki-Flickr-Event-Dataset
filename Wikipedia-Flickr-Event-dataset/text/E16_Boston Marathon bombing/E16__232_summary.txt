L.L.Bean, the well-known retailer of outdoor gear headquartered in Freeport, Maine, announced Wednesday a $150,000 commitment to The One Fund Boston, an organization established by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino to raise funds for people and families affected by last week’s bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
A recent MetroDesk post on Boston.com noted that more than $20 million has poured into the One Fund Boston so far.
“Like so many throughout the country and across the globe, we are saddened and shocked by the events that occurred in Boston Boston,” L.L.
“The One Fund Boston helps to ensure that those individuals and families tragically impacted have a resource to turn to for immediate support as well as ongoing needs as they put their lives back together.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families and the community as a whole, and we want them and the community of Boston to know their neighbors in Maine are thinking of them.
