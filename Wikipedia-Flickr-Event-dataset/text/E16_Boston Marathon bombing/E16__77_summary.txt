Andrew Kitzenberg lives on Laurel Street, in Watertown, Mass.
The Boston Marathon bombing suspects, Tamarlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, were engaging in a wild shootout with police.
Kitzenberg's Twitter account was essential reading that confusing night, and he's now published a series of photos taken from his window.
The car at the left also belonged to the suspectsâ€”they had arrived on Laurel Street separately, something first revealed on Saturday.
