Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sought to embrace American lives after emigrating from Russia - joining a boxing club, winning a scholarship and even seeking U.S. citizenship.
Three U.S. officials involved in the investigation said the brothers had no links to any terrorist groups.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged Monday with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill, and he could face the death penalty if convicted.
The psychological aspects of radicalization have been studied for years, and while there are some similarities among terrorism cases, there is not a single profile of a violent extremist in the U.S.
On the Russian social networking site Vkontakte, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev described his world view as "Islam" but his personal goals as "career and money" - a far more capitalistic goal than Muslim teachings that wealth ultimately belongs to God.
