Two patients lost both their legs.
Many who were wounded when two explosions struck near the finish line of the Boston Marathon were brought to this hospital.
Among the three patients remaining at Boston Children's Hospital is a 10-year-old boy whose leg was amputated and remains in critical condition.
Other hospitals reporting patients who underwent amputations included Massachusetts General (4), Brigham and Women's (1); Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (3); and Boston Medical Center (5).
In the operating room, a team of doctors, including a trauma surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon and a plastic surgeon, "will have a powwow to decide what's salvageable," Campbell said.
