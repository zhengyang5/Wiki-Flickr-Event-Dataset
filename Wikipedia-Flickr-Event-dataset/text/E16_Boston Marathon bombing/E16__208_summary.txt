A federal judge has sentenced Robel Phillipos, a high school and college friend of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, to three years in prison.
Phillipos, 21, was the last of three Tsarnaev friends sentenced to federal prison this week for their actions following the bombing that killed three and wounded more than 260 others in April 2013.
He said Phillipos was in total “disbelief” that his friend Tsarnaev was the Marathon bomber.
Woodlock had sentenced Tazhayakov earlier Friday to 3 1/2 years in federal prison; Kadyrbayev earlier in the week was given a six-year sentence.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been sentenced to death, but a lengthy appeals process is expected.
