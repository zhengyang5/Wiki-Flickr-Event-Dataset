By Gregory KatzBritish police are reviewing security plans for Sunday's London Marathon, the next major international marathon, because of the bombs that killed two people at the race in Boston.
Last year, some 37,500 athletes competed in the London Marathon, with many more watching the springtime event.
Chief Superintendent Julia Pendry, police commander for the London race, said Monday that "a security plan is in place for the London Marathon.
We will be reviewing security arrangements in partnership with (the) London Marathon."
The London race's chief executive, Nick Bitel, said marathon officials contacted the police to discuss security plans "as soon as we heard the news" about Boston.
