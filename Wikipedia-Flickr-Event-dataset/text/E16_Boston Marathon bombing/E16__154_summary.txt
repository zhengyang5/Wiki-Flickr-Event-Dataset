Authorities are now confirming the two suspects sought in Monday's Boston Marathon bombing are two Russian-born (as reported by the AP) Chechen brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev.
Tamerlan, the older brother, is dead.
We know Tamerlan Tsarnaev was 26 and a competitive boxer for a club named Team Lowell.
After flooring Fenner with a huge punch that required an eight count, it seemed that Tsarnaev was in control of the whole fight.
Yet somehow the judges saw it differently and awarded Fenner the decision, a decision that drew boos from the crowd.
