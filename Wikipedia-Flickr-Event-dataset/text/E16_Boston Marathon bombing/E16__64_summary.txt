Officers knew the stolen car was coming to Watertown because they were tracking its movement through the victimâ€™s cellphone.
Police put him down and began to handcuff him when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev drove the stolen car at them.
He looked in the boat, saw blood and someone huddled in a corner and quickly called police.
The discovery set up the final confrontation and capture with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
The street where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found was still closed down and roped off by police tape.
