Questions have been raised in recent days about the political and religious beliefs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect killed in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Friday.
After the sermon ended and the congregational prayer was finished, the preacher met with the older suspect to share his opinion.
The older suspect stood up, shouted and called him a “nonbeliever”; said that he was “contaminating people’s minds”; and began calling him a hypocrite.
People of the congregation, in turn, shouted back at the older suspect, “Leave now!” Due to the congregation’s disapproval, he left the sermon.
Here is the note about the bombing suspects on the door of the Islamic Society of Boston.
