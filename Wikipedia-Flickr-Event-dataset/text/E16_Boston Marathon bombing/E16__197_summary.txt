CLOSE Three college friends of surviving Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev now face charges, including conspiring to destroy evidence and lying to investigators.
Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev, Phillipos and Tsarnaev met on the UMass campus in 2011 and grew closer over the years, court documents say.
Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev and Tsarnaev speak Russian.
Kadyrbayev took the backpack, court papers say, because he wanted to help his friend Tsarnaev avoid trouble.
