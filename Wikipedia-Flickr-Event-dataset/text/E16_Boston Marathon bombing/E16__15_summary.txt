The jury in Massachusetts will now decide what sentence 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will receive.
As the guilty verdicts were read on Wednesday, Tsarnaev kept his hands folded in front of him and looked down .
Nearby, the mother of one victim, eight-year-old Martin Richard, wiped tears from her face after the verdict was read.
The governor of Massachusetts welcomed the verdict, and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said: "I hope today's verdict provides a small amount of closure".
Today they were quiet as the verdicts were read: "guilty, guilty, guilty".
