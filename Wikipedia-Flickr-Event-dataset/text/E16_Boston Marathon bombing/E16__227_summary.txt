Courtesy Corcoran family Celeste Corcoran, 47, right, and her daughter, Sydney Corcoran, 17, were both hospitalized at Boston Medical Center after being injured in the Boston Marathon bombing.
Celeste lost her legs below the knee and Sydney was badly injured.
It will be weeks, at least, before Celeste Corcoran is anywhere near ready to think about artificial limbs.
Speculating too soon about whether the survivors will be running on high-tech artificial legs may skip over necessary stages of grief.
“There will be long days of pain and perseverance ahead before the clouds start to clear.”Already, though, family members say Celeste Corcoran is displaying impressive resilience and strength.
