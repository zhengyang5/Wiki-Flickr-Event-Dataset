One of the recorded phone conversations provided by Russian authorities to the FBI contained a vague dialogue about jihad between Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother, an anonymous US official said.
Secretly recorded phone conversations of the Tsarnaev family have allegedly served as a basis for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to warn their counterparts in the US about possible extremist links of Tsarnaev family.
A US official told Associated Press on condition of anonymity that in 2011 the FSB secretly intercepted a call between the deceased Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother in which they indirectly discussed jihad.
Russian authorities, in the past week did turn over to the US authorities all the available information regarding the Tsarnaev family, AP reports.
Dissatisfied with such a result, the Russian authorities made a second identical request to the CIA in September 2011.
