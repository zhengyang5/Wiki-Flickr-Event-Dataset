According to a family member, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a devout Muslim, was kicked out of his uncle's house because of his increasingly extremist views on religion.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and his brother Dzhokhar, 19, are believed to have placed bombs at the Boston Marathon, killing three and wounding 170.
Members of Congress, however, say those six months last year were a turning point in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's radicalization.
The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government," the FBI statement said.
The relative said Tsarnaev's father is a "traditional Muslim" who eschews extremism.
