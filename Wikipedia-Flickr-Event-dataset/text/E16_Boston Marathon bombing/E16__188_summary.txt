An FBI agent has shot and killed a Florida man who "turned violent" while being questioned about the Boston Marathon bombings, the bureau has said.
A friend of the dead man told the Orlando Sentinel and Orlando television stations that he was 27-year-old Ibragim Todashev of Orlando, a Chechen who had previously lived in Boston.
The FBI said in a statement that a special agent, "acting on the imminent threat posed by the individual, responded with deadly force.
The individual was killed and the special agent was transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries".
"Back when he used to live in Boston, right, they used to hang out," Taramiv told Central Florida News 13.
