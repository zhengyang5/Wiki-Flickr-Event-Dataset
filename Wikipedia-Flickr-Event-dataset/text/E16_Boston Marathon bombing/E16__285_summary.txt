The FBI just released a scathing statement slamming media organizations for erroneously reporting that a suspect had been taken into custody in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings.
Here's the full statement:Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack.
Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate.
CNN first reported that an arrest has been made in the case, reports that were echoed by Fox News, the Associated Press, and The Boston Globe.
Here's video of CNN retracting its report, as former assistant FBI director Tom Fuentes said that his sources were denying any arrest.
