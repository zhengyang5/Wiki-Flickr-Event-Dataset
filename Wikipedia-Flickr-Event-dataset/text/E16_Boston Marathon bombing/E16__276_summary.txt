At the time of the report, Boston Police officials were reporting a death toll of two (which has since been raised to three); the Post was the first to report that any suspects were in custody.

That story links to another report about the "Saudi national," identifying him as a “person of interest” in the headline and a “suspect” in the text.
That blog post was published five minutes before the Post’s story announcing the 12 deaths and a suspect being guarded.
