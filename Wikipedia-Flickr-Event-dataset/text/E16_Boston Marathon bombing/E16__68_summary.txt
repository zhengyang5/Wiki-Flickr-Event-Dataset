When they stopped for gas, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev went inside the Shell station to buy snacks while Tamerlan Tsarnaev pumped gas, police said.
The victim ran across the street to a Mobile station and pleaded with cashier Tarek Ahmed for help.
Ahmed told ABC News this morning that he called police and handed the phone to the carjack victim.
The suspect forced the victim to drive to a second location where they picked up another man, who put something in the trunk.
