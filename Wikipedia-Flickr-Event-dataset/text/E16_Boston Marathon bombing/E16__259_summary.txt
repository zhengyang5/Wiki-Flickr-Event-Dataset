Local daily The Straits Times reported the man had posted the comment on the Yahoo!
Singapore website.
Making bomb threats in Singapore is an offense punishable by a maximum of five years in jail or a fine of up to Sg$100,000 ($82,000), or both.
Separately, police said they were investigating a threat to bomb the Singapore Marathon in December, with no arrests made so far.
The police statement said authorities took a serious view of anyone who “capitalizes on recent security concerns” to alarm the public with bomb hoaxes, and would spare no effort to track down those responsible.
