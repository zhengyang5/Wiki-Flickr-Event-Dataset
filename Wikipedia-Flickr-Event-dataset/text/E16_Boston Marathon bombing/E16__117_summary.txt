But the arrest of Dzokhar Tsarnaev did very little to calm the nerves of the American people.
And investigators certainly weren’t going to read the kid his rights and give him a chance to “lawyer up” if they didn’t have to.
We won’t know for quite a while what kind of questions investigators asked him and what Dzokhar’s responses were.
But as the Wall Street Journal and Slate rightly point out, the post-911 “War on Terror” has definitely put Miranda and Americans’ constitutional rights on shaky ground.
So, the next time a police officer starts questioning you or someone you love, remember this one word: “lawyer.” That’s all you have to say and probably all you should say.
