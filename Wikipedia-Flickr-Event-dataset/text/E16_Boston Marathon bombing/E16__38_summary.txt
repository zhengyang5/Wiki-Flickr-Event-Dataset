As the hunt for the bombers culminated in a dramatic shoot-out, it emerged that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been interviewed by US officials in 2011 because the Russian government was concerned over his ties to “radical Islam”.
The FBI was facing urgent questions last night over the extent of its knowledge of the two brothers, immigrants from the Caucuses.
Zubeidat Tsarnaeva said FBI agents had told her they feared her son Tamerlan was an “extremist leader”.
National security and law enforcement authorities had said earlier that they had not turned up any evidence that the Tsarnaev brothers had contacts with al-Qaeda or other militants overseas.
On Saturday night, FBI agents led a woman wearing a hijab away from the apartment where the brothers had lived in Boston.
