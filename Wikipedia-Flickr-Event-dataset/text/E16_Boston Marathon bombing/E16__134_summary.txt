Authorities suspect the Tsarnaev brothers built the explosives used to attack the Boston Marathon in the older brother's home and chose the prestigious race as a "target of opportunity," sources tell Fox News.
The older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly assembled at least four types of improvised explosive devices in the home Tamerlan shared with wife Katherine Russell, sources tell Fox News.
Additionally, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators the building of the bombs came together more quickly than expected, according to sources.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed after a shootout with police days after the Boston attack.
However, it wasnâ€™t until the FBI released a surveillance photo of the suspects that the friends realized Tsarnaev may have been involved.
