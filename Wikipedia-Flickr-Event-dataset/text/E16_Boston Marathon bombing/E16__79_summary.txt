Ed Davis told CNN he believes Tamerlan Tsarnaev died from being hit and dragged 40 feet by his own brother Dzhokhar.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later.
'They jump out of the car and unload on our police officer,' Deveau said 'They both came out shooting -- shooting guns, handguns.
Moments later, his younger brother ran him over while fleeing the scene in a black Mercedes.
Dr. David Schoenfeld, of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was the one who ended up treating the fatally injured Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
