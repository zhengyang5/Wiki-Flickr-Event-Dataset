Investigators combing through the scene of the deadly Boston Marathon terrorist attack have recovered a circuit board that they believe was used to detonate the bombs, according to an official briefed on the investigation.
Doctors at several major hospitals in Boston said they had seen evidence that the bombs contained some kind of shrapnel.
Similar comments were made by doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston Children’s Hospital, and Boston Medical Center.
A federal investigator who responded to the bombings also said authorities had recovered shrapnel that appeared to be ball bearings or BBs.
But he also said the marathon was a “soft target” because there was open access to the race.
