For those who pass by the square, this makeshift memorial to the Boston Marathon bombing victims remains a stirring testament to the strength of the city and its people.
But now has come the time for the temporary memorial to be taken down, Mayor Thomas M. Menino said in a letter to survivors and victims’ families.
The city plans Tuesday to remove the items and move them to the city archives in West Roxbury for cleaning, fumigation, and archiving.
Menino decided to dismantle the makeshift memorial after conversations with survivors and victims’ family members, said Katharine Lusk, one of his advisers.
With the temporary memorial gone, the city will focus on planning a more permanent remembrance.
