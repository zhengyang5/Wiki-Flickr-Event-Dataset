SOMERVILLE - Sean Collier achieved after death the goal he was denied in life.
Deval Patrick signed a bill allowing Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone to posthumously appoint Collier to the department.
Collier always wanted to return to Somerville and was expected to be sworn in as a Somerville Police Officer this June.
"Being appointed as police officer after death is something that doesn't usually happen, but Sean wasn't a normal police officer," Andrew Collier said.
Somerville Police Chief Thomas Pasquarello, speaking before the board of alderman, said Collier's dream was to become a Somerville Police Officer.
