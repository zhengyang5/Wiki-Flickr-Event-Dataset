Thousands cross Willamette for Boston Remembrance RunPORTLAND -- Thousands of runners filled the streets of Portland and Vancouver Wednesday night to honor the victims of the Boston Marathon attack.
Some of the participants said the run wasn’t about the cardio; this time it was about catharsis.
The crowd gathered along the Portland waterfront and paid respects to the victims killed or injured in Boston this week.
“I’m going back next year and I’m going to run again,” Kiest said.
“And this time I’m going to finish.”
