Boston bombing suspect describes plotInvestigators report that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev says he and brother Tamerlan planned the marathon attack alone a week or so before the race â€“ supporting officials' theory about the bombings.
Investigators say they have confirmed that Tamerlan Tsarnaev purchased fireworks in southern New Hampshire, just over the Massachusetts state line.
He paid more than $400 in cash for two "Lock and Load" reloadable mortar kits, each with four tubes and 24 shells, Zoldan said.
That was how the company linked the purchase to Tamerlan Tsarnaev after the FBI asked about the two brothers Friday.
The shells Tsarnaev purchased would hold 1.5 pounds of gunpowder, but it's unclear whether the explosive was used in the marathon bombings.
