By Manuel ValdesThe intensive manhunt for the bombers behind the deadly Boston Marathon attacks didn't take place only on the streets with professional police officers and SWAT teams.
But as amateur online sleuths began identifying possible culprits, caught in the virtual manhunt were people who were wrongly accused or placed under suspicion by crowdsourcing.
As authorities asked the public for help, Reddit users began piecing together clues in the pictures and videos.
Eventually, efforts and pictures posted in the sub-section dubbed "r/findbostonbombers" and elsewhere on Reddit were picked up by news organisations with more readers, giving it greater exposure.
Several Reddit users who posted on r/findbostonbombers did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
