Officer Richard Donohue, Jr., 33, was rushed to Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, where he is in critical condition.
According to WBZ-TV’s Joe Shortsleeve, MBTA transit police intercepted the brothers who were driving a Mercedes in Cambridge and followed it.
The MBTA said Donohue and murdered MIT officer Sean Collier graduated from the same Municipal Police Officers’ Training Academy class.
“Facing extraordinary danger, Officer Donohue never hesitated in fully engaging the terrorists in order to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth,” said MBTA Transit Police Chief Paul MacMillan.
