European Pressphoto AgencyA federal judge decided to advise Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of his Miranda rights, even though investigators apparently still wanted to question him further under a public-safety exception.
After being read his rights, the suspect stopped talking to investigators, officials said.
APInvestigators are invoking the "public safety exception" in their questioning of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev before advising him of his rights.
Judge Bowler was the first government official to advise Mr. Tsarnaev of his right to remain silent after his capture Friday night, officials briefed on the matter said.
The judge first told the Justice Department on Saturday that she intended to read Mr. Tsarnaev his rights on Monday, according to people briefed on the discussions.
