Ramzan Kadyrov, the ruthless leader of Chechnya, took to Instragam on Friday to respond to the identification of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings as Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot by police on Thursday night, and later died in hospital; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is currently the subject on a manhunt which has seen the city of Boston placed on lockdown.
We already expressed our condolences to the residents of the city and to the people of America.
"Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain.
The roots of evil must be searched for in America.
