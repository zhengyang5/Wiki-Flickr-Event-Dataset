Ethiopia's Tsegaye Kebede and Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya triumphed at a sombre London Marathon on Sunday, as runners paid tribute to the victims of the deadly bomb attacks at the Boston Marathon.
Kebede hunted down 2011 champion Emmanuel Mutai to win the men's race, while Jeptoo surged to victory in the women's event, eight months on from her second-place finish at the London Olympics.
After a frenetic start in the men's race, Mutai led Stanley Biwott, Feyisha Lilesa and Ayele Abshero past the 30-kilometre mark just 10 seconds outside world-record pace.
London Olympic champion Tiki Gelana collided with men's wheelchair athlete Josh Cassidy at a drinks station after 52 minutes and the Ethiopian's challenge never recovered.
Australia's Kurt Fearnley took the honours in the men's wheelchair race after pipping Marcel Hug of Switzerland in a sprint for the line.
