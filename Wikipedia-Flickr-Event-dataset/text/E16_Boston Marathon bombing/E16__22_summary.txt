WHDH cameras rolling on runners approaching the finish line of the Boston marathon, capture the first of two explosions in downtown Boston.
Video from the scene showed two blasts about 20 seconds apart just off the course at the finish.
I could see runners falling in front of me,‚Äù said Dave Abel, a reporter for The Boston Globe who was about 10 feet from one of the explosions.
A third, undetonated device was found near the finish line, a House Homeland Security Committee official and three law enforcement officials told NBC News.
Deval Patrick said the city of Boston would be open Tuesday but warned, "It will not be business as usual."
