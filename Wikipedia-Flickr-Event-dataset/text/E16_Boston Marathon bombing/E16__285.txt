The FBI just released a scathing statement slamming media organizations for erroneously reporting that a suspect had been taken into custody in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings.

Here's the full statement:

Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.

CNN first reported that an arrest has been made in the case, reports that were echoed by Fox News, the Associated Press, and The Boston Globe. Within about an hour, however, CNN and the other outlets began retracting those reports.

Here's video of CNN retracting its report, as former assistant FBI director Tom Fuentes said that his sources were denying any arrest.
