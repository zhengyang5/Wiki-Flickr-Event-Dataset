The three killed were Brenden Mess, one of Tsarnaev’s friends and sparring partners, as well as two Jewish men, Erik Weissman and Raphael Teken, whose affiliations with the others seem unknown.
More on Mess and Tsarnaev:The two sparred together at an Allston, MA gym called Wai Kru.
It was unclear if Tsarnaev knew the other men slain, Raphael Teken, 37, and Erik Weissman, 31.
Last week, friends of Erik Weissman wrote on a memorial page on Facebook that the senselessness of the marathon attack had reminded them of Weissman’s death, about which little remained known.
