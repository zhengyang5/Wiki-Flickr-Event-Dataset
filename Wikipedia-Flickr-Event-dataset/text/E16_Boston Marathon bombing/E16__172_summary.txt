DARTMOUTH -- The UMass Dartmouth campus closed abruptly early this morning after school officials realized the younger of the two men authorities said were responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing is a student there.
The student, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is the subject of an intense manhunt; his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed early this morning in a shootout with police.
School officials know he was there Wednesday because of card swipes, but it was not clear if he had been there earlier.
On its webpage today, the school posted a stark message: â€œUMass Dartmouth has learned that a person being sought in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing has been identified as a student registered at UMass Dartmouth.
He played intramural soccer against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev last year, but said nothing unusual stood out about him.
