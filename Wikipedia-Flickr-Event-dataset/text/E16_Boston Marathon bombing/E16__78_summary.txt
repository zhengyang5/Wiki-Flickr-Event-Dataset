When I looked outside my window, I could clearly see two people (the Tsarnaev brothers) taking cover behind an SUV and engaging in gunfire.
Here are the two brothers taking cover behind the black Mercedes SUV and shooting towards Watertown Police officers.
(Taken at 12:46:25AM)Here itâ€™s clear to see the brothers taking aim and firing on the officers.
As soon as the black SUV had left the street officers rushed toward the green sedan and the spot of the shooting.
