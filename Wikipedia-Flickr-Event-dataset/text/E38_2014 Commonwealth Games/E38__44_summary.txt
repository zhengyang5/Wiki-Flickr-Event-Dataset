“A 62-member squad will leave for Scotland to feature in the Commonwealth Games on Monday and we got a final go ahead,” Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) director general Akhtar Nawaz Ganjera told media.
The 20th Commonwealth Games are scheduled from July 23 to August 3 in Glasgow, Scotland.
Pakistan has competed in 11 of the 19 previous Commonwealth Games, from 1954.
Its most successful games have been the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth, where it was 4th in the overall rankings by winning eight gold medals.
Pakistan won two gold medals in wrestling, one silver (also in wrestling) and two bronze medals in boxing at the last games held in New Delhi in 2010.
