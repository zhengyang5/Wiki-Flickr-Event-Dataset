Graeme Randall was a Scottish gold medal success in 2002

First Minister Jack McConnell was on hand as Glasgow announced the 17 sports that will be included in their bid.

Scotland won 10 judo medals at the 2002 Manchester event but it was dropped in 2006 and will not feature in 2010.

Archery, fencing and basketball are sports to miss out but table tennis, netball, triathlon and lawn bowls are among the 17 listed events.

Athletics, aquatics, boxing, badminton, cycling, gymnastics, hockey, rugby 7s, squash, shooting, weightlifting and wrestling make up all the disciplines.

The First Minister said: "The announcement is about more than confirming the sports that will be in the Games - it is about looking into the future and imagining what those Games will look like.

"In those eleven days sport would transform a city, inspire a country and enthral millions of people.

"These Games will give Scots the chance to shine.

"From the athletes who will make the most of home soil advantage, to the thousands of volunteers who will look after the spectators at the venues, the Games will be something for our whole country to get behind.

"Our bid is incredibly strong. We have the funding in place, we have support from the public in huge numbers and now we have the sports."

Glasgow faces competition as the host city from Abuja, Nigeria and Halifax, Canada.

The winner will be selected in November in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
