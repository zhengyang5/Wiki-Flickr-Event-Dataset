Singapore Sports Hub, Tuesday, July 1, 2014 — More than 80 Team Singapore athletes gathered at a flag presentation ceremony to kick-off their journey towards the 20th Commonwealth Games and the 2nd Youth Olympic Games.

Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, Minister for Manpower and President of the Singapore National Olympic Council, and Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, presented the Singapore flags to the respective Chefs de Mission and flag bearers.

Chef de Mission, Mr Low Teo Ping, who is currently the President of the Singapore Rugby Union, leads the contingent for the 20th Commonwealth Games. The 2nd Youth Olympic Games contingent is led by Chef de Mission, Mr Mark Chay, a former national swimmer.

Mr Tan Chuan-Jin said, “Teo Ping is a veteran sports administrator and has served as Chef de Mission at the Asian Games and SEA Games, while the YOG is Mark’s debut as a Chef de Mission. Mark’s experience as an athlete in multiple SEA Games, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games, puts him in good stead to lead Team Singapore at the YOG.”

The flag bearers for the 20th Commonwealth Games and 2nd Youth Olympic Games are gymnast Lim Heem Wei and diver Jonathan Chan respectively. Shuttler Derek Wong led the athletes in the recital of the pledge to end off the ceremony.

Team Singapore is fielding 70 athletes for the 20th Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Glasgow in July, while 17 athletes will take part in the 2nd Youth Olympic Games, which will be held in Nanjing in August. Among these athletes, shooter Martina Veloso, shuttler Liang Xiaoyu, and swimmers Nur Marina Chan and Samantha Yeo, will be competing in both Games.

“It is an honour to be able to represent Singapore in not one, but two extremely prestigious competitions. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime chance that not many people get to experience and for this, I am extremely grateful,” said Samantha Yeo.
