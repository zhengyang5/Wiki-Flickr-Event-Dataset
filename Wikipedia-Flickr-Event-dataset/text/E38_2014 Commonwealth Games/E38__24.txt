Bermuda first competed in the Commonwealth Games in 1930 at Hamilton, Canada and has missed only four editions of the Games.

Bermuda’s first medal came in Kingston in 1966 with a silver medal for John Morbey in the men’s long jump final. The 1990 Games in Auckland produced the first gold for Bermuda when Clarance Saunders took gold in the men’s high jump, a record that still stands today.
