Women will be able to box for medals at the Commonwealth Games for the first time at the 2014 Games in Glasgow.

The decision means Britain's Olympic gold medallist Nicola Adams can now fight for Commonwealth gold.

"Women boxers have reached world-class levels," said Dr Ching-Kuo Wu, president of the International Amateur Boxing Federation.

Women's boxing at the 2012 Olympics Flyweight: Gold - Nicola Adams (Gbr), Silver- Ren Cancan (Chn)

Gold - Nicola Adams (Gbr), Silver- Ren Cancan (Chn) Lightweight: Gold - Katie Taylor (Irl), Silver - Sofya Ochigava (Rus)

Gold - Katie Taylor (Irl), Silver - Sofya Ochigava (Rus) Middleweight: Claressa Shields (USA), Silver - Nadezda Torlopova (Rus)

"The Commonwealth Games will be another opportunity for these athletes to showcase their talents."

The Commonwealth Games Federation included the sport after the impact it made at the London 2012 Olympics.

Some all-out attacking displays at the London Olympics this summer drew huge acclaim and won over many critics as Adams, Ireland's Katie Taylor and American Claressa Shields took the first Olympic gold medals in front of sell-out crowds.

There will be three categories for women at the 2014 Games; flyweight, lightweight and middleweight.

Wu said he would push the International Olympic Committee for at least six weight categories for the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Both the Olympic and Commonwealth men's boxing tournament feature 10 weight divisions.
