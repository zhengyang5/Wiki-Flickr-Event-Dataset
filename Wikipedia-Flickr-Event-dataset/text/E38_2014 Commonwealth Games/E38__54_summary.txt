Sports‘TEAM Tanzania’ jetted off to Glasgow, Scotland exuding confidence that they will excel at the 20th edition of the Commonwealth Games, set for July 23 to August 3, this year.
A squad of 36 athletes drawn from boxing, athletics, cyclists, judokas, table tennis, swimming and wrestling has been ordered by President Jakaya Kikwete to win medals for the country.
The president reminded the athletes that they are deeply indebted to the nation and the only way to appease it is to win medals.
With this burden in their shoulder, the national amateur boxing team has promised to win medals in Glasgow.
And the boxers are targeting to end this sad scenario at the Glasgow Games when they step into the ring under a new scoring system.
