Veteran shooter Susan Nattrass was named Thursday as Canada's flag-bearer for next month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland.
Nattrass, 63, has appeared at six Olympic Games — most recently in 2008 in Beijing — and has won seven world titles in trap shooting.
At the 1976 Montreal Games, Nattrass became the first woman ever to compete in Olympic trap shooting, finishing 25th against her male counterparts.
Nattrass successfully lobbied the Commonwealth Games Federation to include women’s shotgun events, which made their debut in in 2002.
The Canadian team finished fourth in the overall medal standings at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India.
