Chef de Mission Emma Waiwai is confident with the amount of effort athletes, sporting bodies and the general public have put in, assuring the athletes give their best performances to date.

Ninety-three athletes and 47 officials are set to leave Papua New Guinea’s shores as early as next month as they prepare to showcase the country’s finest talents at the prestigious 2014 Commonwealth Games.

Team PNG will be represented in 10 sports: athletics, swimming, boxing, lawn bowls, table tennis, triathlon, weightlifting, squash, judo and rugby sevens.

Chef de Mission Emma Waiwai confirms that although it is an event of its own, the Commonwealth Games poses an ultimate bonus for National Sporting Federations.

The triathlon contingent departed last weekend to participate in possible lead-up matches and pre-training at the Gold Coast in Australia, then flew to Guam for the Pacific Series.

They will join the rest of the team in Glasgow when the village opens up on the 13th of July.

The finalized athletics team will travel to the Gold Coast for the Oceania Tournament and while the 7’s boys travel to London for several lead-up matches, the majority of the weight lifters in New Caledonia will be heading off to Rome.
