The Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games Council has revealed its largest ever team, with a total of 117 local athletes participating across 14 sports, during 11 days of world class competition at Glasgow 2014.
A Northern Ireland netball squad makes its debut at the Games while both judo and triathlon make a return, having not been included within the program for Delhi 2010.
While the Games will provide a fantastic experience for the team members, it also provides a challenge to them all to perform as they travel with the support of the Northern Ireland public.
This call for support was emphasised by Chef de Mission, Robert McVeigh, as he stated, ‘we’re delighted to be taking our largest ever team to Glasgow, in what is essentially a home Games for Northern Ireland.
We have a great mix of youth and experience within the team which is drawn from all parts of Northern Ireland and from all sections of our community.
