March 8 - The new £95,000 logo for Glasgow's 2014 Commonwealth Games has today been unveiled at an event in the city.
"We now need to raise the revenue required to help stage the Games through selling the rights to the brand identity as sponsorship.
"I am confident that its distinct style, its inherent element of fun and flexibility for both on and off line environments will attract organisations wishing to be associated with the Commonwealth Games to become our sponsors.
"With all of Scotland on board we can make our Commonwealth Games a fantastic sporting event and a catalyst for positive change in our nation.
"We are very pleased with the results, it’s original and refreshing with a great degree of flexibility, and we look forward to seeing the new brand being used to promote the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games both within Scotland and throughout the Commonwealth.
