18 year old Alex Beddoes was the country's Junior Sportsman of the Year 2013.
In May, 2013, he set a new Cook Islands record of 1:54.65 in the Open Men 800m at the North Island Secondary School Championships in New Zealand.
He's since topped that this year with a time of 1:53:71.
But he needs to be looking for around 1 minute 45 to be in with a chance of a medal at the Games.
The youngster will be back in Rarotonga at the end of this month for the Oceania ChampionshipsAnd Alex has decided to delay starting his university studies this year because he's earned himself an invitation to train with the New Zealand high performance team in the USA for three months.
