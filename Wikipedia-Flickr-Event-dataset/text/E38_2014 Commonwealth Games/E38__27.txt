Veteran shooter Susan Nattrass was named Thursday as Canada's flag-bearer for next month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland.

Nattrass, 63, has appeared at six Olympic Games — most recently in 2008 in Beijing — and has won seven world titles in trap shooting.

The native of Medicine Hat, Alta., won the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada's top athlete in 1981.

“I’m ecstatic... I love the Commonwealth Games and will do my best to be worthy of this exceptional group of athletes that we have on our team,” she said.

At the 1976 Montreal Games, Nattrass became the first woman ever to compete in Olympic trap shooting, finishing 25th against her male counterparts. She broke the gender barrier again in 1990 when she competed at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland as the only woman in an all-male event.

Nattrass successfully lobbied the Commonwealth Games Federation to include women’s shotgun events, which made their debut in in 2002.

Nattrass has previous flag-bearer experience. She carried the Maple Leaf into Maracana Stadium for the opening ceremony of the 2007 Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

“Susan has that rare quality of being both a pioneer in her sport while still being a competitive, world-class athlete,” said Team Canada chef de mission Chantal Petitclerc. “She will be an inspiration to all of us in Glasgow, and I am thrilled that she has accepted to be our flag bearer.”

The Commonwealth Games take place from July 23 through Aug. 3, with live coverage every day on CBCSports.ca.

Canada plans to send a team of 267 athletes and close to 100 coaches and support staff, making it the largest team ever fielded by the country for a Commonwealth Games held outside Canada.

The Canadian team finished fourth in the overall medal standings at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India. Canada's 75 medals (26 of them gold) put it behind leader Australia, England and India.
