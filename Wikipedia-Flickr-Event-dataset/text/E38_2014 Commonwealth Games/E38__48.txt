Team Samoa believes it is capable of its achieving its biggest ever medal haul at this month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Samoa will send a team of 41 athletes to this month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow to compete across eight sports.

Four years ago, in Delhi, the Pacific nation won four medals, including three weightlifting golds.

The country's Chef de Mission, Aualiitia Faafouina Milford, believes they are capable of even more this time around.

"This team is a little bit stronger than four years ago but we learned from Delhi and the mistakes that we made in the past four years so those games have shaped us for the future so now we shape up in accordance to what we saw. Team Samoa is looking to assure that each sport we now participate in come back with medals".

The eight sports Samoa will contest are athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, judo, rugby sevens,

shooting, swimming and weightlifting.
