Tonga believes boxing can again provide the spoils at the Commonwealth Games, which get underway in Glasgow next week.
The Kingdom will send a team of 16 athletes to the 2014 Games, in swimming, diving, athletics, boxing and weightlifting.
Lomalito Moala and Junior Fa won bronze medals at the Delhi Games four years ago in the lightweight and super heavyweight classes.
"In the Oceania Pacific region we are the only one - even New Zealand and Australia didn't have any medal in boxing - and those two athletes are still willing to compete for Tonga.
I think they still have a chance and also the other boxers have a very good prospect".
