First Minister Alex Salmond boards a flight to Colombo in Sri Lanka

Glasgow faces competition from Abuja in Nigeria. The Commonwealth Games Federation will announce the result of their vote on Friday in Colombo.

Mr Salmond said the bid team would appeal to "the head and the heart" to persuade delegates to back Glasgow.

He said they would treat the last few days of the campaign like an election.

"We are certainly not complacent, we are confident but not over-confident," he said.

"We go out with high hopes and brave hearts."

Sports minister Stewart Maxwell, gymnast Steven Frew and bowler Kay Moran also travelled to Colombo.

A total of 71 countries will vote for the tournament hosts.

Mr Maxwell said: "We have to make sure that we maximise the amount of time that we spend with the delegates who have not yet decided.

"There are countries who have still to make up their minds."

Glasgow City Council leader Steven Purcell has already travelled to Sri Lanka.

It has been confirmed that Mr Salmond will attend a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Sri Lanka.

The first minister will visit the graves of the Commonwealth war dead in Liveramentu Cemetery, the main cemetery in Colombo.
