Uganda’s athletes and officials at the 2014 Commonwealth Games will each receive a package of 2.1 million shillings as allowances for the 14 days the Games will run in Glasgow, Scotland.



Ambrose Tashobya, a member of the Uganda Olympic Committee (UOC) executive and the Chief-de-mission of Team Uganda to the Games, disclosed to URN this afternoon that they have budgeted 180,000 shillings or 72 Dollars per day for each athlete and official to be received between July 23 to August 3.



Tashobya explained that even if the athletes will travel to Scotland on different days, they decided to set a standard figure. He however said they will have to keep their fingers crossed as they have a budget deficit of about 347 million shillings and it’s from that money that allowances must be got.



He sounded optimistic that the Minister of Sports, Charles Bakabulindi, would help them fundraise and clear the deficit so that allowances and a debt of 100 million shillings to the Emirates Air can also be cleared.

Uganda will send a contingent of 98 people including a field of 62 athletes in different sporting disciplines. Team Uganda will however miss Olympic gold medalist and World marathon champion Stephen Kiprotich who opted to skip the Games for what he called general tiredness.



Moses Kipsiro, a double gold medalist at the last Commonwealth Games in India, is part of Uganda’s team together with medal hopefuls Jacob Araptany, Abraham Kiplimo and US based Ronald Musagala.



Vice President Edward Ssekandi will lead Uganda’s contingent to the Games, while Education, Sports Minister Jessica Alupo and Minister for Sports Charles Bakabulindi and Commissioner for Physical Education & Sports Omara Apita will also travel.



Uganda will field athletes in rugby, cycling, track and field events, badminton, table rugby, shooting, boxing, squash, table tennis, swimming, Para sports and weightlifting.
