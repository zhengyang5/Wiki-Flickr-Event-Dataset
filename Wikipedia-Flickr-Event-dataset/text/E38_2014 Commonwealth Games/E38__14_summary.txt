Glasgow is a great world city, a place that's changed so much over recent decades, a place that continues to change.
The venues in which the athletes will compete have already attracted numerous World, Commonwealth and European Championships.
Commonwealth Games fever gripped the nation, even although the action was taking place thousands of miles away in Melbourne.
Supporting the Glasgow bid means guaranteeing that those special moments are available to every single member of this Commonwealth family.
That is our vision for the Commonwealth Games in 2014.
