The Solomon Islands are pinning their hopes of weightlifter Jenlyn Wini to win the country's first ever medal at the Commonwealth Games.
The Chef de Mission for Team Solomon, Ronald Talasasa, believes she is poised to break the country's Commonwealth drought.
"First medal was at the Youth Commonwealth Games in Isle of Man in 2011, then now for the senior games or the main Commonwealth Games we are expecting Jenlyn to win a medal.
We are really hopeful the way she has been training at the weightlifting institute in Noumea - a good basis for us to say that Jenlyn will be for the first time at the senior games for the Solomon Islands to win Commonwealth Medal".
The Solomon Islands will be sending a total of 12 athletes to Glasgow later this month where they will also contest athletics, judo, wrestling and triathlon.
