He's a hulking 103.5kg barrel of a man who lists dancing and singing as his hobbies and now David Katoatau is the first person from Kiribati to win a Commonwealth Games medal.

In an enthralling 105kg weightlifting competition, the man who led the tiny Pacific Nation's 18 athletes into last week's opening ceremony held his nerve to lift 194kg in the clean and jerk and scoop gold with a total of 348kg.

Sitting in fourth spot after the snatch event, Katoatau watched on patiently as all his rivals completed their three clean and jerk lifts before finally making his way to the stage.

With the excited crowd roaring him on, the 30-year-old lifted the bar as swiftly as a thirsty punter would lift a pint in Glasgow's lively west end on a Friday night and drew thunderous applause in the Clyde Auditorium.

His second lift of 200kg was irrelevant, but being the showman he is and grinning broadly as he approached the bar, Katoatau succeeded again, before being foiled in his attempts to make 205kg.

Stanislas Chalaev of New Zealand took silver for the second consecutive Games with at 341kg total, whilst England's Benjamin Watson claimed bronze on 337kg.
