2014 European Parliament election turnout was lowest ever, revised data shows The 2014 turnout figure of 43.09%, based on exit polls, has been revised down half a percentage point – putting it lower than the 43% turnout in 2009.

The final turnout figure for this year’s European Parliament elections has been revealed as 42.54% – the lowest-ever turnout and lower than the number communicated immediately after the elections.

On election night, 25 May, exit polls suggested a turnout of 43.1% based on preliminary figures. This was revised down to 43.09% a few days later. It was a disappointing figure for the Parliament, but it was still slightly higher than the 43% turnout in the last election in 2009, which Parliament leaders proclaimed as a moral victory.

“We are witnessing a historical moment because for the first time since 1979, the long term trend of declining turnout has been reversed,” said Jaume Duch Guillot, the Parliament’s chief spokesperson, on election night. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the liberal ALDE group, and Hannes Swoboda, leader of the social-democrats, said the turnout in this year’s elections was “an endorsement of the European project”.

Verhofstadt suggested that the increase was because of the introduction of the Spitzenkandidat system with each political group having a candidate for the European Commission presidency. “Turnout would have been worse if there had not been the Spitzenkandidaten contest,” he said at the time.

The deduction of more than half a percentage point is based on actual turnout data which was lower than exit polls in several countries. Turnout in France was 42.43% compared to the exit poll figure of 43.5%. Luxembourg’s turnout was 85.55% compared to 90% and Italy was revised down from 60% to 57.22%. At the same time, the numbers increased compared to the exit polls in countries such as Lithuania, from 34.91% to 47.35%; Poland, from 22.7% to 23.83%; and Slovenia, from 20.96% to 24.55%.

A spokesperson said the Parliament does not intend to issue a statement publicising the new figure. “The final figure of 42,54% is very close to the estimate given in the evening of 25 May and confirms that the descending turnout tendency of previous elections has been stopped,” he said. “It confirms a de facto status quo when compared to the 2009 turnout.”

Before the elections took place, officials in the European Parliament feared a low turnout. €16 million was spent on a publicity campaign to encourage the 400 million eligible voters in the European Union to cast their vote. A higher number than the 43% recorded in 2009, seemed crucial for the EU’s credibility.

The new figure of 42.54% is officially the lowest level recorded since the direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979.
