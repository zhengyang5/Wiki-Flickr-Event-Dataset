This would allow to European political parties, which are still structures in development […] to stabilise their programs and to set a platform around personalities,” Barroso said.
The major European political families are expected to elect soon their Commission president candidate in an effort to put a “face” on the EU elections next May.
“To my knowledge, no party has designated candidates," Barroso said, adding that he would advise them to do so.
Barroso also said it would be “interesting” if the candidates of the European political parties held televised debates similar to those before national elections.
The Lisbon Treaty however says nothing about the direct election of the European Commission president.
