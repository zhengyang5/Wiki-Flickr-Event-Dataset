Amid confusion over when and how they will take up their seats, the European Parliament has decided to give the MEPs only "observer" status from next year.
The 18 MEPs, from 12 EU countries, including Britain's West Midlands region, will be paid more than £76,000 a year, with staff and office allowances worth £210,000.
Richard Corbett, the Labour MEP who guided the Lisbon Treaty through the European Parliament, defended the arrangement to make them "observers".
A row over the extra MEPs could also reignite Britain's debate over a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, especially if Westminster MPs are asked to approve a deal before a general election next spring.
Timothy Kirkhope, leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament, said.
