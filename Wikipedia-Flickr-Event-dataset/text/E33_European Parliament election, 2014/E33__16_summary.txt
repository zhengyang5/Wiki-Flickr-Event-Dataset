A legislative vote in May risks becoming “a festival of unfounded reproaches against Europe” unless mainstream parties deploy “rational arguments and passion,” European Commission President Jose Barroso told the European Parliament today in Strasbourg, France.
The May 22-25 elections to the 28-nation assembly, which has a say over EU laws covering everything from financial services to farming, could be “tense,” he said.
“We are seeing, in fact, a rise of extremism from the extreme right and from the extreme left,” Barroso said.
“I hope we’ll have a more profound European debate and the European project will be more strongly defended than before.
