British Prime Minister David Cameron looked increasingly isolated in his campaign to block Jean-Claude Juncker becoming head of the European Commission, after Sweden and the Netherlands softened their opposition.
Asked whether the comment acknowledged likely defeat, a senior British official said in Brussels: “The prime minister is certainly not throwing in the towel about next week.
Cameron has failed to win over new allies despite intensive efforts to woo Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whom he telephoned again on Wednesday (18 June).
Without Italy, Cameron is far from having a blocking minority of states representing 38% of the EU population.
At the end, Cameron might be alone,” the European affairs adviser to one continental prime minister said.
