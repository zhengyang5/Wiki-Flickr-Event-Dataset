The Presidium of the HU-LCD decided to support Dombrovskis after evaluating his contribution to bringing the economic crisis under control, the HU-LCD said in a statement.
Other candidates include ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker, French European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services Michel Barnier, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny and Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen.
Uniting Europe’s leftists, including the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the Party of European Socialists has already nominated European Parliament President Martin Schulz.
