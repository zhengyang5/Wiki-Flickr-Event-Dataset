A former French National Front MEP has joined Nigel Farage’s Europe of Freedom and Democracy group in the European Parliament, which now has enough support to re-form.
The party, led by Marine Le Pen, asked her to leave her seat in favour of another candidate.
The widowed auctioneer joins the new Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, which was formed tonight (18 June), as an independent.
Under EU rules, a group can be formed with at least 25 MEPs from seven different EU countries.
“We will be at the forefront working for the restoration of freedom, national democracy and prosperity across Europe,” Farage said.
