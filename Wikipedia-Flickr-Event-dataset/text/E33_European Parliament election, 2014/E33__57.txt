The newly elected heads of delegation of the ALDE group met for the first time yesterday since the European elections and formally agreed to accept the application of the Czech ANO 2011 Party as member of the group.



Guy Verhofstadt said:



“We are very happy to welcome a Czech Party into the ALDE group for the first time. The centrist-liberal ANO Party, led by Andrej Babis, came top of the poll in the Czech Republic with 16.13% and brings four new seats. Pavel Telička, a former diplomat who negotiated the country’s EU accession in 2004 and was subsequently their commissioner, will lead their delegation. He and his colleagues will bring a valuable Central European perspective to the ALDE group as well as strengthening the liberal-centrist core of the European Parliament fighting for a stronger and more focused EU.”
