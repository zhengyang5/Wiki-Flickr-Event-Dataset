As Commission President, I will set myself five priorities.
I will work on this from day one of being Commission President.
As a second priority, I want to reform and reorganise Europeâ€™s energy policy in a new European Energy Union.
A fifth and last priority for me as Commission President will be to give an answer to the British question.
As Commission President, I will be ready to talk to him about these demands in a fair and reasonable manner.
