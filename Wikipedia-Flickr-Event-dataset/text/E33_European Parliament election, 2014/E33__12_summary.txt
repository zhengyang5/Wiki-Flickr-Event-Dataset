France's National Front party has come out top in a poll on how French voters intend to cast their ballot in next year's EU elections.
But it describes a new reality in French political life.
Le Pen has styled herself as protecting France against both the "European Soviet Union" and against Muslim immigration.
Both Wilders and Le Pen have mooted the possibly teaming up to campaign ahead of the elections.
European political parties have not nominated candidates yet but there is increasing talk of Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, a veteran of the EU scene, being the centre-right's candidate.
