The European Union should brace for “chaos” after the European elections a year from now if the surprise victories by renegade, anti-EU parties in recent Italian and British elections are any sign of what is to come, European liberal leader Graham Watson said.
“Under those circumstances the two groups might work closer together to ensure that the European Union is governable,” said Watson.
Voter turnout in the European Parliament elections was 43% in 2009, the lowest since direct elections began in 1979.
Watson said the ALDE group and other European parties are preparing the timetable for the European elections.
The Liberal timescale mirrors that of other European parties, but no one has set a definite date for nomination.
