Europe's leaders were plunged into a power struggle over who gets the biggest job in the EU late on Tuesday, with David Cameron seeking to drum up support to prevent a veteran insider becoming the new head of the European commission.
In the past 48 hours, Cameron has phoned several leaders, including Angela Merkel of Germany, in an attempt to build a "stop Juncker" coalition.
But it is up to the national leaders, not the parliament, to propose a new commission president.
The parliament's move represented the first gambit in what promises to be an exhausting protracted battle between rival EU institutions over who gets to decide the next commission president.
The attack on the FN was taken up by Viviane Reding, the vice-president of the European commission.
