Irish party's leader Michael Martin says Brian Crowley had effectively left the party for joining 'crowd of headbangers'

Ireland's main opposition party in the Dáil has withdrawn the whip from its only MEP after he allied himself with a Eurosceptic rightwing group in the European parliament.

Fianna Fáil said it had removed support for Brian Crowley because he had joined a "crowd of headbangers" in Brussels.

The MEP has allied himself to the European Conservatives and Reformist group, which includes parties that honour former members of the SS in Belgium.

Michael Martin, Fianna Fáil's leader, said Crowley had effectively removed himself from the party for unilaterally joining the rightwing bloc. Martin said he told Crowley the move was "totally unacceptable".

The group includes the Belgian Flemish National party, some of whose members attend commemorations for SS fighters recruited in Belgium during the Nazi occupation. It also incorporates the True Finns party, which has espoused anti-immigrant and radically rightwing policies.

Describing the group as "a crowd of headbangers", Fianna Fáil's chief whip supported the party leader's move against Crowley.

Seán Ó Fearghaíl said he was "reeling and bewildered" over Crowley's move. "Brian, unfortunately, had no discussion with the parliamentary party and there were no discussions about this particular unilateral action by him at national executive level either," Ó Fearghaíl said.

Fianna Fáil, once the most powerful force in Irish politics, was aligned to the Liberal ALDE alliance in the European parliament.
