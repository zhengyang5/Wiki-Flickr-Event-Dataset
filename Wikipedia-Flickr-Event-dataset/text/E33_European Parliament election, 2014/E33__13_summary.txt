A new survey shows the traditionally liberal Dutch becoming increasingly right-wing on immigration, with almost two-thirds of the population of the view that new arrivals from Bulgaria and Romania are likely to abuse the social welfare system and get involved in crime.
Mr Rutte’s government has set up a research project in a last-minute bid to undermine populist claims that Dutch workers are being squeezed out of jobs by cheaper labour from eastern Europe – but the SCP survey makes it clear that those views are firmly entrenched.
The findings show that six out of 10 Dutch voters believe there were already “too many” immigrants from eastern Europe in the country – even before the lifting of restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian arrivals on January 1st.
They also show that – whatever the outcome of the research by social affairs minister Lodewijk Asscher – 47 per cent of the population believes that because eastern Europeans are typically willing to work for less, they are in effect “taking Dutch jobs”.
The survey shows the government is clearly failing to hammer home its point that of some 600,000 nationals from various EU states currently living in the Netherlands, only about 20,000 are claiming any form of unemployment benefit or social welfare.
