Having public candidates for the Commission presidency during the next EU elections is not the panacea for Europe’s credibility woes, says European Council President Herman Van Rompuy.
While European parties look for figureheads for their EU election campaigns, the president of the European Council feels this will not resolve Europe’s democratic deficit.
Joining him in the debate were former French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González and former President of the European Commission Jacques Delors.
The Lisbon Treaty, that went into force in 2009, stipulates that the next European Commission president will be chosen “taking into account the results of the European elections”.
The idea could also tackle the EU’s another European election issue; turnout has been falling since the first direct elections of the European Parliament in 1979.
