COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The far-right, euro-skeptic Danish People’s Party may emerge as Denmark’s biggest vote getter at the European parliamentary elections in May, a poll indicated on Saturday.
The People’s Party would get 15 percent of the vote if the elections, slated for May 22-25, were held now - outdoing both the Social Democrats and Liberal Party, long the two biggest mainstream parties in the Nordic state.
The Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and Liberals are expected to get 13-14 percent each, the Gallup poll conducted for the Berlingske newspaper showed.
One of Denmark’s 13 members of the European Parliament is from the Danish People’s Party while the Social Democrats hold four seats and the Liberals three.
The polls suggested nearly one-third of Danes have not made up their minds about who to vote for at the May election.
