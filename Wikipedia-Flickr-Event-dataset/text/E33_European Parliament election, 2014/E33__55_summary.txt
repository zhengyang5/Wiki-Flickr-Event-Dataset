The ALDE Group of Liberals was tonight (17 June) joined by 12 MEPs from four parties, making it the third largest group in the European Parliament with 67 seats.
The N-VA, domestic rivals with Belgian liberal members of ALDE, have left the European Free Alliance group in favour of ALDE.
The N-VA, previously a member of the European Free Alliance group, was also negotiating with the UK Conservative-led European Conservatives and Reformists (here).
The ALDE Group also elected Guy Verhofstadt, their Eu Parliament election leading candidate as president.
MEPs in the new European Parliament are forming groups of parties.
