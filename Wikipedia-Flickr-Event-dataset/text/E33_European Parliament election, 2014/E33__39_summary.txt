By Dave Keating - 20.02.2014 / 17:30 CETCentre-right group of British Conservatives and allies will not put forward a candidate for European Commission president.
To defend its decision, ECR released an opinion poll conducted by ComRes which found that 65% of Europeans surveyed in the six largest EU countries have never heard of Martin Schulz, the Party of European Socialists candidate for Commission president and current president of the European Parliament.
Jos√© Manuel Barroso, the current president of the European Commission, was unknown to 26% of those surveyed.
Martin Callanan (pictured), the ECR group's president, said that this lack of a European demos means that any process of directly electing a European Commission president would be illegitimate.
Callanan acknowledged that the ECR is in talks with other political parties about joining ECR, but would not say which ones.
