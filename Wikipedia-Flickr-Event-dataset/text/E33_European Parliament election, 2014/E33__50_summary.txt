ECR group takes two parties from Farage The ECR group, launched by the British Conservatives and allies in 2009, has snatched the Danish People’s Party and The Finns away from Nigel Farage’s EFD group.
There are four Danish People’s Party MEPs and two in the delegation of The Finns.
The ECR group also voted tonight to accept applications from one MEP from the German Family Party, two Slovak MEPs from the NOVA and OL’aNO parties, and one Independent Greek.
The additions raise the number of ECR MEPs to 55, just four short of the 59 seats currently held by the Liberals (ALDE).
The Danish People’s Party is generally described in Denmark as being ‘right-wing populist’.
