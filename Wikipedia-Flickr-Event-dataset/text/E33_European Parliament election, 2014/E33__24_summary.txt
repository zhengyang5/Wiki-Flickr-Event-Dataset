Essentially since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the President of the European Commission is to be ‘elected’ by the European Parliament.
So if a party wins the EP elections (or at least end up as the largest group) then they should get the Commission President job too.
In 2009 the Party of European Socialists did not agree on one candidate for Commission President, and lost the elections anyway.
Would be the first female Commission President if successful.
His commitment to the European Union while he was Prime Minister was sometimes questioned, not least when he nominated the centre-right Barroso for Commission President in 2009.
