Crin Antonescu, the chairman of the Romanian National Liberal Party (PNL) announced today (26 May) that his party is going to give up its affiliation with the liberal ALDE family, and switch to the centre-right EPP.
“Due to the European context, I will ask the Bureau of the Party – the executive body – to allow liberal MEPs to affiliate themselves with the EPP,” said Antonescu.
Second, he said, there was “a doctrine compatibility” between EPP and PNL, the latter being traditionally a centre-right party.
“The meaning of this decision is that right politicians should join their forces in the EU and in Romania,” Antonescu told the Brussels press.
Second came PNL, and third, the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) at 12.23%.
