Leaders of political family lists in the European elections automatically become candidates for the next president of the European Commission.
According to the Lisbon Treaty, the next Commission president will be chosen taking into account the results of the European elections.
The PES and EPP have already announced that they will chose a candidate for Commission president well ahead the European elections to mobilise voters.
But for Rehn to obtain the ALDE nomination, liberal forces in EU countries would have to support his candidacy.
It is highly unlikely that the lists of two of the three major European political families be led by leaders of the same nationality.
