German Chancellor Angela Merkel has poured cold water on hopes the European Commission President candidate of the most popular political party after next year's EU election will automatically get the post.
Otherwise the commission president will be voted by the parliament based on a proposal by the [EU leaders]," she noted.
This sees EU leaders negotiate behind doors to divide up the posts of the commission president, foreign affairs chief and EU council president.
Merkel said there are important posts to be distributed by EU leaders and that should be "distinguished from" political parties putting forward top candidates.
New rules allow the European Commission to see the budgets of euro states before national parliaments do.
