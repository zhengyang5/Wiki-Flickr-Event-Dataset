Nigel Farage inflicted another body blow on the three main political parties on Sunday night as Ukip scored a stunning victory in the European Parliament elections.
The anti-EU party dramatically built on its success in the local elections in England last Thursday when the results of the Euro poll on the same day were announced.
In the South East of England, Ukip now has four seats - including for Mr Farage himself and his number two, Janice Atkinson.
“The Front National is an extreme party; Ukip is not,” she told the BBC.
In Thursday’s local elections, the Lib Dems lost 307 seats and control of two councils.
