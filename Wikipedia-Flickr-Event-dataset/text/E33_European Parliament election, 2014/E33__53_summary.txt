Beppe Grillo, the Italian comedian who is head of Italy's anti-euro Five Star Movement is to team up with Nigel Farage to "bring down Brussels" from within the European Parliament.
"I look forward to working with 5 Star Movement very much to provide a genuine voice of opposition in the European Parliament.
No one is whipped and told how to vote provided they adhere to the principles of the group," Mr Farage told Five Star members in a video appeal.
Mr Grillo took 21 per cent of the Italian vote, giving him 17 seats in the European parliament and making his Five Star Movement the second biggest party in Italy.
This feeds into a process of solidifying what should be a big group," said Mr Farage, who is holding talks with MEPs from five countries.
