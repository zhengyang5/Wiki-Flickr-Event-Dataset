The Central Committee of the KKE assessed the course of the group European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) over the recent period and the objective situation that arises from the composition of the EU Parliament after the EU parliamentary elections and decided that the MEPs of the KKE would not join any group in the EU parliament.
The situation is deteriorating as the EU, in the framework of the deepening of its reactionary character, is prioritizing the functioning of EU parties that safeguard the further strengthening of the Commission and its multi-tentacled mechanisms.
The EU parliamentary group of the KKE throughout this entire period opposed these dangerous choices.
However, despite the efforts of the KKE, GUE/NGL is being used as a tool of the ELP.
The non-accession of the KKEâ€™s MEPS to a specific existing political group, as well as the suffocating operating framework of the EU parliament can not impede the intervention of the KKE.
