Fianna F치il said it had removed support for Brian Crowley because he had joined a "crowd of headbangers" in Brussels.
The MEP has allied himself to the European Conservatives and Reformist group, which includes parties that honour former members of the SS in Belgium.
Michael Martin, Fianna F치il's leader, said Crowley had effectively removed himself from the party for unilaterally joining the rightwing bloc.
Describing the group as "a crowd of headbangers", Fianna F치il's chief whip supported the party leader's move against Crowley.
Fianna F치il, once the most powerful force in Irish politics, was aligned to the Liberal ALDE alliance in the European parliament.
