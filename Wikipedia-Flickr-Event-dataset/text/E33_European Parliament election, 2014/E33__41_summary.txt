In two months time citizens of all European Union member states will vote on who can represent them in the European Parliament.
The former Pirate Bay spokesperson announced his plans last year, but with the European Parliament elections coming closer this idea has now become reality.
However, due to his involvement with The Pirate Bay, Sunde is without a doubt the most recognized name on the ballot.
As if the candidacy for the European Parliament isnâ€™t enough, today the European Pirate Party also elected the Pirate Bay founder as their pick for the European Commission presidency, together with Amelia Andersdotter.
As can be expected of the Pirate Bay founder, he has strong opinions on the topic of file-sharing and freedom of information.
