To restore our self-confidence and have a positive influence on world affairs, we have to transform the next EP Elections into a real competition.
We must do it noisily by stirring controversies and debates with the other parties, by mobilising our members and finding new support.
We have to convince citizens that they have a say in EU affairs and that, unless they speak up, EU will split again.
If they don't, we will not solve the crisis and our collective irrelevance will be inevitable.
My decision to run in this Primary stems from an ambition to participate in a team with the other contenders to make our proposals visible and credible across the EU, well ahead of the EU elections.
