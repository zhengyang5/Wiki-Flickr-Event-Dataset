The EU elections are likely to deliver big gains for populist parties of the left and right, namely those opposed to the European project and/or further integration.
The rise of populism is beginning to drive the governing parties of centre-left and centre-right together in a forced alliance to implement reforms and sustain the European project.
The UK Independence Party (Ukip) is now projected to win 26% of British votes in the EU elections.
Gains for populism in the euro elections will force the established and elitist forces that underpin the European project to work better together, both internationally and nationally.
Populism might do well in the euro elections, but the reaction of the centre mainstream might well be to unite in delivering economic reform in Europe to sustain the European project.
