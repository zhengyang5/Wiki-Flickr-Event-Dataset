Irish MEP leaves ALDE for ECR group Move puts ECR further ahead of ALDE in contest to become the third biggest group in the European Parliament.
The move is a further blow to the ALDE group’s attempts to recruit enough members to become the third-largest group in the Parliament, ahead of the ECR.
Crowley, who was a co-leader of the UEN group, resisted the move, and it was not until 2009 that Cowen’s desire prevailed.
Michaél Martin, leader of the centre-right FF party, who was Europe minister back in 2004, said that he would have wanted Crowley to stay in the ALDE group.
The ECR group will take a formal decision on admitting Crowley at a meeting in Brussels tomorrow (24 June).
