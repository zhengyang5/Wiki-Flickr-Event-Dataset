In its Group meeting in Strasbourg yesterday evening, the S&D Group endorsed the application of European Parliament president Martin Schulz as candidate for the European Commission president.
The S&D Group, a member organisation of the PES, is the second largest political group in the European Parliament, with 194 MEPs from 28 countries.
Hannes Swoboda, S&D Group president, said:"Martin Schulz was president of the S&D Group for eight years, and our successful candidate for president of the EP in the second part of the current mandate; he always stood for a fair and socially balanced vision for Europe.
"We appreciate that several national parties have already nominated Martin Schulz as their candidate for the upcoming European Parliament elections.
Martin Schulz is our natural choice, as he stands for the progressive ideas of our Europe-wide Group.
