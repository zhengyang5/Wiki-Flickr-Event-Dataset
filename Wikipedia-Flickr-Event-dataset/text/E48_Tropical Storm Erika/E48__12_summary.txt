Tropical storm Erika broke up as it raked across Cuba on Saturday, drenching the drought-parched island in heavy rain after killing at least 20 people on the Caribbean island of Dominica.
Floods and mudslides unleashed by the storm left scenes of devastation in the island of about 72,000 people.
In Cuba, the heavy rains came as welcome news to an island enduring its worst drought since 1901.
After pounding Dominica on Friday, Erika let loose on Haiti, where authorities set up emergency shelters across the country.
Flooding was reported in two regions after heavy rains.
