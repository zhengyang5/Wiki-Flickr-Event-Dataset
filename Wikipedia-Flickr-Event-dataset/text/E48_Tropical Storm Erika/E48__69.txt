The Adventist Development Relief Agency (ADRA) of the Seventh-day Adventist Church has joined the relief efforts for Dominica following the passing of Tropical Storm Erika.

On Friday the 11th of September a donation was made to the Government of Dominica by Director for ADRA for the Eastern Caribbean Conference of SDA, Dr Colin Thorne.

“It is a privilege to ADRA to be part of the response team here in Dominica Unusually when there is a disaster in any part of the world, ADRA responds. In the Caribbean, with all the disasters which took place in the past, ADRA always acted in accordance with its mandate,” he said listing Haiti and St. Lucia. “Our response is usually immediate.

“In this case, we found that financial contribution was the fastest response we could provide at this time.”

According to Dr. Thorne, donations to the ADRA branch in Dominica have already been made for resources and storage. He extended sympathy to the people of Dominica.

The Director presented a check of EC $34,375 to the Hon. Minister for National Security and Immigration, Hon. Rayburn Blackmore.

Hon. Blackmore thanked ADRA for its timely donation noting that the funds will go a long way as Dominica moves towards recovery.

He described it as an honour to accept “this wonderful gift” on behalf of the Dominican people.

“ADRA has always been there for us in trying time. You were there during Hurricane David and you were instrumental in building homes. For the past two weeks, we have been in emergency response mode and your contribution will go a long way as we transition from that mode into reconstruction and recovery.”

The Minister for National Security further revealed plans for the construction of new homes with the assistance of the Eastern Caribbean Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists.
