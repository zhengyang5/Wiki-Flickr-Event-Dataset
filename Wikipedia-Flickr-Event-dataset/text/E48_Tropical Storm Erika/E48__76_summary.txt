The latest is a 70,000€ donation by Dominica/ Guadeloupe Solidarity Committee in collaboration with the Contact and Research Association for the Caribbean (CORECA) and the Dominican Consulate in Guadeloupe.
The donation will go towards the rehabilitation of the Delices and Soufriere Primary Schools which were extensively damaged during the storm.
“Access to the Delices Primary School has been seriously compromised and thro of requires repairs which…makes it impossible for class to resume at the school.
In fact, the Delices Primary School is now housed at the Delices Youth Centre,” he said.
“At the Soufriere Primary School, the heavy rains of Tropical Storm caused silting of the classrooms and eroded the school’s retaining wall; also, serious damage was inflicted to the fence.
