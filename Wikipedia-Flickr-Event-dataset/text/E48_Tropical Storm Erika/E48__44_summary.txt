While several organizations are focusing on bringing financial and other forms of physical relief to Dominica, post Tropical Storm Erika, the Dominica Spa Health and Wellness Association (DSHWA) is concerned about bringing emotional wellness.
The association has solicited the assistance of the Trinidad-based, Centre for Human Development Ltd to provide direct intervention and to train individuals to offer counseling to those who need it.
The institution is here with four clinical psychologists, including President and Chief Executive Officer, Hanif Benjamin.
While the training is broad, persons with direct intervention skills including teachers, pastors and other community leaders are particularly targeted.
Benjamin encouraged Dominicans to look out to each other and advised stronger individuals to be pillars of support.
