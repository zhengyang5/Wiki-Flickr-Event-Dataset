Dominica continues to benefit from relations with the Federative Republic of Brazil.
The most recent initiative was a donation of medicines and medical supplies to the Ministry of Health on Wednesday, October 14th.
Over $23,000 worth of medicine and medical supplies were gifted to Dominica by the Ambassador of the Federative Republic of Brazil to Dominica, His Excellency Jose Marcos Viana.
It is not the first time Dominica has received aid from Brazil following natural disaster.
Minister for Health was Dr. Martin Christmas who says the supplies come at a very critical time for the Ministry.
