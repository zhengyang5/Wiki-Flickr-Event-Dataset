Farmers hampered by Tropical Storm Erika will soon have access to their farms thanks to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The FAO has made available emergency assistance to the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors in the form of $300,000.

A signing agreement took place at the Division of Agriculture on Friday 23rd.

Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Harold Guiste says the quick response by FAO speaks volumes.

“The greatest impediment to our agricultural and eco-tourism recovery is lack of access. This project will address access and this is in fact a great relief to us because there are several farmers who have produce locked on the other side of landslides…There are other farmers who are eager to start planting and they do not have access to transport inputs or plants to their holdings.”

Claus Eckelman represents the Food and Agriculture Organization.

“Additional activities will be the stabilization of landslide areas, stabilization of agricultural lands and rehabilitation of forest and eco trails which are so important for the economy of Dominica.”

Through financing provided by the FAO and in collaboration with Inter-American Institute for Corporation on Agriculture (IICA), persons will be engaged to rehabilitate forest and agricultural access roads. The project will also address on-farm infrastructure and fund training workshops to retool farmers.

The agriculture sector suffered losses of over $100m.
