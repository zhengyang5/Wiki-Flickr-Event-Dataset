The Ministry of Agriculture is estimating that the industry has suffered $109m in damage as a result of Tropical Storm Erika.
GIS News discussed the subject with Agriculture Director, Ricky Brumant on Tuesday September 22nd.
â€œA number of feeder roads was undermined, sections of roads are gone and the surface of a lot of roads was eaten up.
While some areas suffered more damage than others, Brumant says farmers everywhere have been adversely affected.
Despite challenges, the Ministry of Agriculture has a plan to rebuild the sector by putting farmers back to work as quickly as possible.
