Government has identified several locations to permanently resettle those displaced by Tropical Storm Erika.

Hon. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit made the announcement at a press conference on Friday, October 9th.

He listed, “Warner; Geneva, Grand Bay; near the Pierre Charles Secondary School in Grand Bay; Bellevue Chopin, and La Plaine. So there are several areas at which we’re looking for resettlement. The first 50 houses from Venezuela will go towards the resettlement of the Dubique community.”

The Adventist Development Relief Agency (ADRA) has also come onboard to assist in the resettlement efforts.

“ADRA has offered us, in the first instance, 10 two and three bedroom homes. They will build them and hand them over to the beneficiaries with the hope of taking this number to 25 that is on top of the BDS $50,000 which ADRA gave to us directly and about $100,000 in supplies to various communities and families.

Over 800 homes were destroyed during the storm.

The entire communities of Petite Savanne and Dubique will be resettled.

Five million dollars approved by the Mexican Government for the indoor sporting facility has been reallocated to resettlement efforts.

Resettlement, repairs and reconstruction costs exceed EC $91m.
