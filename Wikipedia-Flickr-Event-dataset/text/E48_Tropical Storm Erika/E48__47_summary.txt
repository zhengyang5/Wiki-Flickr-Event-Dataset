Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Johnson says since Tropical Storm Erika, the risk of the public’s exposure to mosquito-borne illnesses disease is real especially with the increased use of water storage containers.
“A lot of us have to store water in drums and sometimes these drums are not covered which increases the chances of mosquito breeding.
We are monitoring this very aggressively and are intensifying the source reduction campaign specifically the Aedes Egypti mosquito,” he said.
He listed dengue and Chikungunya- the latter which nationals know all too well.
Although no new cases have been reported, he nevertheless encourages the public to take the necessary precautions primarily to reduce the number of breeding sites.
