Many people do not see themselves needing mental health services after a disaster.
This is why the Mental Health Team of the PMHâ€™s Psychiatric Unit led by Chief Psychiatrist, Dr. Griffin Benjamin has been visiting communities across the island tending to those most affected by Tropical Storm Erika.
GIS News spoke with Dr. Griffin Benjamin in an exclusive interview on Wednesday September 16th.
Just three weeks after Erika, Dr. Benjamin explained that it is time for the island to begin to experience a sense of normalcy.
They report that the initial reaction to the Tropical Storm Erika varied from shock to helplessness, disbelief and confusion.
