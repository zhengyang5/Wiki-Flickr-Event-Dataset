The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has provided emergency assistance to the Government of Dominica in the wake of Tropical Storm Erika.

Following the ravages of the storm on august 27th, the Hon. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit made an appeal to countries and international agencies to assist Dominica in this crisis.

JICA responded and has provided electric generators, water purifiers and water tanks totaling about US $100,000.

“The people of Japan deeply empathise with your country’s plight and we are greatly concerned about the well-being of your nation,” said Mitsuhiko Okada, Ambassador-designate of Japan to Dominica

The Hon. Minister for National Security, Rayburn Blackmoore, in receiving the supplies says he is touched by the outpouring of international support which Dominica has seen.

He extended gratitude to the JICA for their prompt response to the island’s needs.

He says based on demonstrations of goodwill and unity, he is confident that Dominica will bounce back.

JICA has also pledged to provide financial support to Dominica’s recovery.

Hon. Blackmoore says Government has in mind the development of a model village to accommodate those who have lost their homes. He also solicited the support of Japan in that regard.
