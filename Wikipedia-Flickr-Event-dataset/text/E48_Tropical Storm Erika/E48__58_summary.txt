Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Lyme Bay is approaching the final phase of her taking to assist the island of Dominica following Tropical Storm Erika.
"I am so pleased, therefore, that RFA Lyme Bay has made such a significant contribution to dealing with the worst of the storm’s aftermath.
Lyme Bay has a diverse team onboard made up from Royal Fleet Auxiliary, Royal Navy, Royal Marines plus Army engineers and logistic personnel.
Although there are recovery projects which will take many months to complete the island’s disaster relief managers were clearly able to use the first-response assets of Lyme Bay to make a difference."
RFA Lyme Bay has now departed Dominica and is now re-storing and preparing for further tasking in what is the most risky period for hurricanes in the region.
