Georgetown, Guyana – (September 14, 2015)A shipment of 75 tons of rice will leave the shores of Guyana early Tuesday morning for the Island of Dominica, which was severely hit by Tropical Storm Erika a few weeks ago.
Minister of State, Joseph Harmon, was present at the Guyana National Industrial Company Incorporated (GNIC) Wharf earlier today, along with representatives of Fairfield Rice Incorporated, Tecnomills Guyana Incorporated and Sagrice Groups Incorporated, to witness the loading of the containers.
While making brief remarks on the occasion, Minister Harmon said the administration was very pleased to join forces with the members of the Private sector.
“Initially when we spoke we were targeting 25 tons, but as the days went by more people came out to show their support in a more dynamic way,” Minister Harmon added.
This venture is a joint initiative, and includes assistance from GNIC, Tropical shipping, the Guyana Rice Development Board and the Civil Defence Commission.
