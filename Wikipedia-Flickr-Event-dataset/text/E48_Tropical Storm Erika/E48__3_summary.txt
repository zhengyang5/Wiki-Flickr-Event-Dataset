The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are scheduled to investigate Erika later today and should provide a good estimate of the strength of the system.
The track forecast reasoning is similar to that from the previous advisory package.
Over the next couple of days, Erika should be steered west-northwestward on the southern side of a subtropical ridge.
Later in the forecast period, the track models diverge with the HWRF and U.K. Met.
Given the significant spread in the guidance in 3 to 5 days, confidence in the track forecast late in the period is low.
