Minister for National Security, Rayburn Blackmoore has expressed gratitude to the Regional Security System for what he considers to be remarkable assistance to Dominica in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Erika.

The Regional Security System is an organisation comprised both military and police personnel which works to preserve the stability and well-being of member states.

On Wednesday September 30th, a closing ceremony was held for the team as they prepared to leave the shores of Dominica.

“Search and rescue and the maintenance of law and order are critical. Because of our challenges at the time with our local law enforcement agency, we thought that we needed additional help and in quick time, we had 83 members of the respective forces of the RSS including police and defence force in Dominica,” said Minister Blackmoore.

He added that in addition to search and rescue, security services were also provided at various sites which were compromised by Tropical Storm Erika.

Hon. Blackmoore also recognized their outstanding execution of search and rescue missions especially in the community of Petite Savanne.

He says the RSS evacuated hundreds of persons from that community without incident.

The Barbados Coast Guard also provided exceptional service to Dominica. The team was also thanked for their exceptional services. They too left the island on Wednesday.
