SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - Tropical Storm Erika lashed Puerto Rico with rain and wind Friday after killing at least four people and causing devastating floods and mudslides in the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica, where authorities said about 20 people were still missing.
Authorities in the Dominican Republic prepared for Erika's arrival on Friday, including the popular tourist areas of Punta Cana, Samana and Puerto Plata.
Meanwhile, rescue crews in Dominica continued to search for missing and injured people after the storm dropped 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain as it passed over the island.
Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit urged citizens of the country to help clear streets strewn with mud and toppled trees following the passage of the storm.
In Puerto Rico, the storm knocked out power to more than 200,000 people and toppled trees but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
