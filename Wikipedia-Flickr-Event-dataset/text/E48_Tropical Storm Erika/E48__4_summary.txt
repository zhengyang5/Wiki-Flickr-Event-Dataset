ZCZC MIATCDAT5 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM TROPICAL STORM ERIKA DISCUSSION NUMBER 10 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL052015 500 AM AST THU AUG 27 2015 Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that Erika has strengthened overnight, although it is not clear as to how much.
Aircraft data and satellite imagery show that Erika is still a sheared tropical cyclone, with the deepest convection found east and southeast of the center due to about 20 kt of westerly shear.
The models are in poor agreement on the eventual structure and track of Erika late in the period.
Given the large spread and the continued run-to-run variability, little change was made to the NHC track forecast.
The new NHC forecast is closest to the latest GFS model prediction at day 3 and beyond.
