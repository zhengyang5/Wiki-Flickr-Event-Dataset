OECS Commission 27/08/15 ---- The OECS Commission is engaging with regional and international agencies to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the effects of tropical storm Ericka on the Commonwealth of Dominica as that country seeks to respond after floods devastated the island costing loss of life and leaving many homeless and lacking basic commodities on Thursday August 27, 2015.

The directorate of the OECS Commission is very concerned about the situation in Dominica and is communicating with Heads of Government of other OECS Member States, the international donor community and organisations to ensure the best possible actions. As small island states we have common vulnerabilities to climatic issues and weather systems which impact on all our Member States and although limited in our own resources we are strengthening our response to Dominica through dialogue towards a coordinated response from agencies such as National Emergency Management Orgainsations, UNDP, CEDEMA, ECLAC and USAID.

Our prayers go out to those who are hurt by this phenomenon at this time and we are confident that the spirit of community and resilience form which Dominica is well known will restore that country’s glowing physical and socioeconomic landscape. The OECS Commission will continue to update the public this coordinated response to Dominica’s needs.
