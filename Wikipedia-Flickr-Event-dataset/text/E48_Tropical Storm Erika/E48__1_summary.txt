Based on these data, advisories are being initiated on a 40-kt tropical storm.
Erika becomes the 5th tropical storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season.
After that time, the intensity guidance diverges with the statistical guidance and the HWRF bringing Erika to hurricane strength.
Due to the large spread in the intensity guidance, the intensity forecast at days 3-5 is of low confidence.
Erika is moving quickly westward across the tropical Atlantic or 275/17 kt.
