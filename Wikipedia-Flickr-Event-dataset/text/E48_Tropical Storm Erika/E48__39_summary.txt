ROSEAU, Dominica, Wednesday September 9, 2015 – Government will build new homes in a completely different area for residents of Petite Savanne, the community in the southeast of the island that was worst affected by Tropical Storm Erika’s destructive rains last month.
Petite Savanna was one of nine communities designated special disaster areas after the storm, and residents had to be evacuated via sea, after flooding and landslides buried houses and made the area unstable.
Residents of another disaster area, Dubique, will also be given homes at a new site.
“They, in fact, pointed out to us several locations that are not very close to Petite Savanne for consideration,” Skerrit noted.
Sites for relocating Dubique residents are also under consideration.
