The WMO will replace Erika with “Elsa”, Joaquin with “Julian” and Patricia with “Pamela” when the 2015 lists are reused in 2021.
Erika was a tropical storm whose torrential rains inflicted significant casualties and damage on the Caribbean island of Dominica.
Patricia is the 13th name to be removed from the eastern North Pacific list.
In comparison, Erika and Joaquin are the 79th and 80th name to be removed from the Atlantic list.
NOAA’s National Hurricane Center is responsible for issuing tropical cyclone forecasts and warnings for both the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific basins.
