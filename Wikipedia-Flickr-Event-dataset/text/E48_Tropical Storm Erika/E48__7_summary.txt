ZCZC MIATCDAT5 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM TROPICAL STORM ERIKA DISCUSSION NUMBER 18 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL052015 500 AM EDT SAT AUG 29 2015 Erika remains very disorganized with the deep convection still displaced well east and southeast of the apparent center.
Assuming Erika survives the next 24 hours, some restrengthening is possible over the Gulf of Mexico in a less hostile environment.
Given the uncertainty in the initial position and motion, and whether Erika even has a closed center, confidence in the details of the track forecast remains low.
The greatest short-term threat posed by Erika continues to be very heavy rainfall over portions of Hispaniola and eastern Cuba.
