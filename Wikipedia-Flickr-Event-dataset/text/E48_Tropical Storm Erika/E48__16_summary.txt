Florida Governor Rick Scott is urging residents to remain prepared as the remnants of Tropical Storm Erika head for the southern part of the state.
Friday evening Erika was a disorganized tropical storm bound for the mountainous terrain of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
But Norcross, along with other forecasters, warned it's still too soon for anyone in Florida to let his guard down.
Earlier in the day, Scott declared a state of emergency for every county across the state.
Plenty of long-time Florida residents also worked quickly to dust off their emergency kits and gather any supplies they needed.
