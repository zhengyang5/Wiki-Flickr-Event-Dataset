Dominicaâ€™s main airport, Douglas-Charles has proven to be a top priority for the Government of Dominica.
The Honourable Minister for Public Works and Ports, Senator Mirium Blanchard, assured citizens that the airport, while safe, is being further rehabilitated for passenger and motorists safety.
A major project was developed at the airport in Melville Hall aimed at restoring its safe operations, implementing storm repairs while improving flood protection.
Work continues to advance on the major works at Douglas-Charles Airport.
In fact, a milestone of the project was just reached last week with the reconstruction of roughly half of the apron and taxi ways.
