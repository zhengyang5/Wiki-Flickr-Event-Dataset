Nationals residing in the south east of the island will soon benefit from a $100m road project.

Speaking at a town hall meeting in Pichelin last week, Hon Minister for Public Works and Ports, Miriam Blanchard announced that the project to rehabilitate the Loubiere to Bagatelle road is made possible through the joint efforts of the British Government and the Government of Dominica.

“It’s going to include the construction of between 12 and 14 large culvert crossings. The project is also going to include three new bridge structures; one at the location of the Geneva bailey bridge, another at the Pichlen bridge and the third in Mitchem.... Another aspect of that project is going to include addressing road edge failure …,” she explained.

“We’ve all seen the pictures of the devastation from Tropical Storm Erika. We all know the experiences that lead from a lot of rain in a short space of time and the size of the current culverts we have in Dominica; that volume of water was just too much to be accommodated by the culvert structures that we had in the past…your new major development project that will transform your section of the island is going to address these vulnerabilities…”

She revealed that work on the project is expected to commence soon and will engage persons residing in various areas along the construction of the road.
