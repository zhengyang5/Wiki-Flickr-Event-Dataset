Following the passage of TS Erika, private sector company, Digicel joined forces with the Dominica Red Cross to assist in its relief and recovery efforts.
Last week, the Dominica Red Cross society assisted by Digicel Play volunteers, officially commenced food and water distribution in Roseau and environs and prior to that in Bath Estate.
Director-General of the Dominica Red Cross, Kathleen Pinard-Byrne says Digicel came onboard since the activation of the Emergency Operation Centre and their partnership has since grown.
“Very early in the game, Digicel Play partnered with Red cross to assist us in carrying out our assessment bearing in mind that road access was unavailable.
“Digicel Play actually paid for boats to take us into the communities to do our damage and needs assessments.
