Hon. Parliamentary Representative for the Petite Savanne Constituency, Dr. Kenneth Darroux has appealed to members of the public to be sensitive to the plight of those displaced as a result of Tropical Storm Erika.

In an exclusive interview at GIS studios on Thursday, September 17th, the Petite Savanne MP revealed that some of the evacuees housed at the Dominica Grammar School have been subjected to insensitive remarks from some members of the public.

“I think it’s insensitive for passersby to tell them to get out of the school, that the children need to go to school. Today, it’s Petite Savanne, tomorrow, it could be their community.

“The people of Petite Savanne did not commit any crimes and are not there for punishment; all of these people have left their comfortable homes in Petite Savanne. They are not there by choice,” he pleaded. “Have a heart.”

He added that Government is working to identify locations around town to house the evacuees sheltering at the DGS.

“A lot of people have offered their homes free of charge,” Hon. Dr. Darroux revealed. “The plan is that we phase out the people from the shelters for the 4-6 months until rebuilding or relocation.”
