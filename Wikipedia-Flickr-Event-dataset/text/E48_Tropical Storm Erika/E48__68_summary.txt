On August 27, Dominica was hit by tropical storm Erika.
The storm flooded many Caribbean countries but its catastrophic effects were particularly felt by Dominica, a small Caribbean state.
In the wake of the storm the Prime Minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, sent out a plea for international help.
On accepting the supplies she said: â€œThe Government of Dominica is extremely grateful for the continued support from the Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth stands in solidarity with the Government and people of Dominica and will continue to support them and provide practical assistance wherever possible.
