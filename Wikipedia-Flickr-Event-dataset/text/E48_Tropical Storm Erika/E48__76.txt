The latest is a 70,000€ donation by Dominica/ Guadeloupe Solidarity Committee in collaboration with the Contact and Research Association for the Caribbean (CORECA) and the Dominican Consulate in Guadeloupe.

The donation will go towards the rehabilitation of the Delices and Soufriere Primary Schools which were extensively damaged during the storm.

Hon. Minister for Education, Petter Saint Jean says the donation will go a long way to allow students a safer environment for learning.

“Access to the Delices Primary School has been seriously compromised and thro of requires repairs which…makes it impossible for class to resume at the school. In fact, the Delices Primary School is now housed at the Delices Youth Centre,” he said.

The education sector is continuing to receive much needed assistance following Tropical Storm Erika.

“At the Soufriere Primary School, the heavy rains of Tropical Storm caused silting of the classrooms and eroded the school’s retaining wall; also, serious damage was inflicted to the fence. In fact, a new retaining wall will have to be looked at which will increase security and decrease the school’s vulnerability to inclement weather.”

Project Coordinator, Delia Desbois says the focus is primarily on renovation.

“It is for us to identify the priority needs for these schools and channel the necessary solutions to respond.”

The group raised 20,000€ and received an additional 50,000.

President of CORECA, Julian Merion, is thankful for the solidarity between Dominica and Guadeloupe.

“It was a very beautiful experience, the display of solidarity. Many people came to say that they wanted to do something for Dominica. I saw that Dominica and Guadeloupe are brother and sister, not just in words, but in action.”

Representative of the Consulate of Dominica in Guadeloupe, Cherdieu D’alexis says there is still much work to be done to get Dominica, and in particular its students, to a state of normalcy.
