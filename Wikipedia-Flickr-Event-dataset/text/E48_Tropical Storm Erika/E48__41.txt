FOR THE RESIDENTS of the small mountain village of Petite Savanne, this wound cuts deep.

The roughly-dug graves are still fresh. Flowers placed on top are starting to wither, and people still pass by making the sign of the cross in memory of their loved ones.

Stranded from civilisation since last Thursday when Tropical Storm Erika ravaged the island, Petite Savanne residents had no choice but to bury their own dead, and mourn them later.
