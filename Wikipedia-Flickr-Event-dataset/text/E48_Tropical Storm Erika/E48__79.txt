The agreement was signed by the Honorable Minister for Foreign Affairs, Francine Baron and Stefano Manservisi, European Commission Director for International Co-Operation and Development at the recent EU-CELAC summit held in the Dominican Republic.

The overall post-Erika rehabilitation project, which will be carried out through the Ministry of Finance is part of efforts by government to source concessionary or grant funding that will mitigate the effects of tropical weather phenomena.

The project is being financed under the 11th European Development Fund and will be administered via the general support programme.

In the margins of the presentation of credentials on November 2nd by the new European Ambassador to Dominica, Her Excellency Daniela Tramacere, to the President of the Commonwealth of Dominica, His Excellency Charles Savarin, Ambassador Tramacere also held a meeting with the Honorable Prime Minster, Dr Roosevelt Skerrit, where details of the financing agreement were discussed.

Immediately following the damage caused by Erika, the EU’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department provided EC$913,000 in emergency humanitarian funding to assist those most affected.

Meanwhile, Ambassador Tramacere also discussed other aspects of Dominica’s cooperation with the European Union, such as the programme of the Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). Dominica was allocated 15.27 million Euros for the BAM and to date 95 percent or 14.5 million Euros of all BAM funds have been contracted.
