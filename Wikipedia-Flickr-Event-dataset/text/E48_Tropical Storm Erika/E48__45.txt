An eight member team of trauma specialists from the Massy foundation of Trinidad and Tobago is on island to provide support for citizens affected by Tropical Storm Erika.

Team leader, Wendell de Leon says since their arrival, his team has been all over the island visiting affected areas.

“We have been to a number of places besides the shelters. We have had community groups and determined the extent of the trauma and have been able to help the people articulate the pain and hurt.”

The team is collaborating with the local mental health team.

De Leon says the team of highly-trained specialists is mainly focused on helping to deal with displacement.

“A lot of stuff is happening. People are hearing that school is reopening and there is a sense of panic and anxiety. That trauma can take a while [to dissipate]; they need a lot of support at the individual and macro levels,” he said.

The team which is in Dominica until the 16th is also intent on rebuilding the mental resilience of those affected.

The team leader asks that nationals remain sensitive to the plight of their fellow man during this time.
