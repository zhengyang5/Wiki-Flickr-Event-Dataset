Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said:It is clear that the impact of Tropical Storm Erika on the people of Dominica has been severe.
RFA Lyme Bay is well placed to provide important, immediate assistance to Dominica in order to ease suffering and to assist the population in beginning to rebuild their lives.
The British ship RFA Lyme Bay has now arrived and has started work on the recovery efforts.
Loaded with food, clean water and shelter, as well as a Lynx Mk 8 helicopter, it will provide a lifeline to the people of Dominica.
Lt Cdr Rob Kenchington RN, Lynx helicopter pilot said:We knew before we arrived that there had been wide-spread damage cause by Erika, but the flight this morning confirmed the scale of the devastation.
