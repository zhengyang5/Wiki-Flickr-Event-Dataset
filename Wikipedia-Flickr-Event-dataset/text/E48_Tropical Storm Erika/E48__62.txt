Following the passage of TS Erika, private sector company, Digicel joined forces with the Dominica Red Cross to assist in its relief and recovery efforts.

Last week, the Dominica Red Cross society assisted by Digicel Play volunteers, officially commenced food and water distribution in Roseau and environs and prior to that in Bath Estate.

Director-General of the Dominica Red Cross, Kathleen Pinard-Byrne says Digicel came onboard since the activation of the Emergency Operation Centre and their partnership has since grown.

“Very early in the game, Digicel Play partnered with Red cross to assist us in carrying out our assessment bearing in mind that road access was unavailable.

“Digicel Play actually paid for boats to take us into the communities to do our damage and needs assessments. They have also made their vehicles available to move persons around.

“They continue to assist us by [rallying] some of their staff to help with distribution both from here and in the community.

“So they are a very important partner who have done an excellent job in providing the in-kind assistance that we needed.”

Jessica Pinard Byrne of the Digicel Play Volunteer Committee shared, “We are very happy to be part of this partnership with the Dominica Red Cross. We have come out in numbers. About 24 of our agents are out on the ground assisting in the day-to-day volunteer work of the Dominica Red Cross and this is in an effort to show that we care…we also want to give back.

“We appreciate the welcome from the Dominica Red Cross.”

Meantime, Director-General of the Dominica Red Cross informed that the society will soon undertake a cash transfer program which will focus mainly on the evacuees of Petite Savanne.

That cash transfer program is in the form of debit cards with a value of US $125.00 totaling US $50,000.
