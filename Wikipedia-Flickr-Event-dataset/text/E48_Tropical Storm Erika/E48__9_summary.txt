The American Red Cross is preparing to help when Tropical Storm Erika comes ashore on the United States mainland over the weekend.
In Florida, Red Cross workers are ready to respond across the state as Erika nears.
The storm is expected to move up the East Coast, and Red Cross workers in Georgia are making response plans with local and state officials.
Meanwhile, the Red Cross is already assisting people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands where Erika is still affecting the weather.
