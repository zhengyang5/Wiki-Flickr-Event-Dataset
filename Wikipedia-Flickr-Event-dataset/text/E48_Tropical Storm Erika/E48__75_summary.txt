General Manager of Dominica’s water supply company, Bernard Etinoffe says every community in Dominica now has access to potable water since Tropical Strom Erika.
“Prior to tropical Storm Erika, we were nearing 100% access to potable water; in fact on completion of the Belles/Sylvania/Layou Park Water Project we would have been at 99%.
“All 44 water systems were tremendously affected.
“Temporary restoration cost DOWASCO in excess of $5m and the more permanent work will cost in the region of $38m.
“It is not the best thing; we know that people complain from time to time when there is no water at night.
