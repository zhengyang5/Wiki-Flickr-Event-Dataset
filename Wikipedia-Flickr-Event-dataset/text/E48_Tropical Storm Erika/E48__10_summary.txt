Kenneth Mapp on Wednesday urged residents to take the necessary steps to protect themselves as Tropical Storm Erika pays a call on the territory today.
Government offices are closed today and Mapp said a decision about opening on Friday will be made later tonight or early Friday.
Erika, expected to make her closest swipe at the territory later today, will be the second tropical cyclone to threaten the V.I.
The ports are typically reopened once a storm has passed and Coast Guard teams inspect the ports to ensure there are no storm-related hazards.
The people of the territory, he said, "are hurricane-hardened and have full experience," and should get through Erika "with flying colors."
