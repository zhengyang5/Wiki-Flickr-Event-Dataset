Tropical Storm Erika, coming as it did so close to the beginning of the new college and professional football seasons, is a reminder that Monday-morning quarterbacking is nearly as popular an activity as the sport itself.
So, in the spirit of searching for a tropical storm eureka, in this blog entry we present some of our own post-storm reflections.
And nearly all of this error was a rightward (northward) bias – that is, Erika moved consistently to the left of the NHC forecast track.
When this happens, it’s very difficult to tell just how much influence those upper-level winds will have on the storm track.
In this case, not getting the track right made it much harder to get the intensity right, which made the track forecasts harder yet.
