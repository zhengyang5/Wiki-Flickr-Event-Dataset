Parliamentary Representative for the La Plaine Constituency, Petter Saint Jean says his part of the country suffered massive damage during Tropical Storm Erika.
This is evident in the deep gorge that still exists separating the communities of Delices and Boetica from the rest of the country.
â€œA 30 meter Bailey bridge will be put in place to connect the two segments of the road across the river.
That will create temporary access for the people of Delices and Boetica to get into La Plaine and on to other parts of Dominica.
I know that concerns have been raised but this is a temporary access road.
