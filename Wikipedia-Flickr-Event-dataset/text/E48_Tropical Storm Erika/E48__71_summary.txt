PAHO Director Carissa F. Etienne visited Dominica this week and met with government officials as well as PAHO staff working on the ground.
She visited a number of health facilities and affected communities as well as temporary medical storage sites where supplies and donations are being registered, catalogued and stored before they are distributed to health facilities in different districts.
On September 9, four tons of medical supplies sent by PAHO arrived in Dominica.
The supplies were offloaded at the Windsor Park Stadium, from which they are being distributed to health facilities across the island.
The PAHO team also brought medical supplies and water purification tablets donated by Saint Lucia and Barbados.
