The payment of the sugar workers was made possible by an EC$ 16 million dollar donation from the Venezuelan Government under the PetroCaribe agreement.
In his address at the ceremony, Prime Minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, lauded the Government and People of St. Kitts and Nevis for their generous contribution.
“Prime Minister, I want to thank you publicly and your people for this extraordinary generous offer of EC $1 million dollars to us,” Prime Minister Skerrit said to the cheers from the crowd.
Dr. Harris underscored the point that there are many Dominicans living and working in St. Kitts and Nevis.
Prime Minister Skerrit said that Dominica will get back on its feet again.
