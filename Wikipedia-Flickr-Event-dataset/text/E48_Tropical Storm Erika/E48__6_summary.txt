ZCZC MIATCDAT5 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM REMNANTS OF ERIKA SPECIAL DISCUSSION NUMBER 19 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL052015 930 AM EDT SAT AUG 29 2015 Surface observations from Cuba, satellite imagery, and reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that Erika has degenerated into a trough of low pressure, with the remnants of the center located near the north coast of eastern Cuba.
The remnants are expected to move west-northwestward near the northern coast of central and eastern Cuba for the next 12 to 24 hours and reach the southeastern Gulf of Mexico in about 36 hours.
The dynamical models suggests that the current strong wind shear could relax by the time the system reachs the Gulf of Mexico, and there is a possibility that Erika could regenerate.
This will be the last advisory on this system by the National Hurricane Center unless regeneration occurs.
