[Photo credit: Inter-American Division]The Adventist Development Relief Agency (ADRA) in Dominica is leading the rebuilding efforts after hundreds of families were left homeless by Tropical Storm Erika last August.
Local ADRA Project Coordinator Priscilla Prevost said that ADRA is presently in the foundation phase of the project.
So far ADRA and volunteers have begun the construction of three three-bedroom homes and five two-bedroom homes, explained Prevost.
Church leaders visit a team of ADRA volunteers in Dominica earlier this month.
â€œOur heartfelt prayers and concerns are with the people of Dominica still suffering the effects of this devastating storm.
