Georgetown, Guyana – (September 14, 2015)

A shipment of 75 tons of rice will leave the shores of Guyana early Tuesday morning for the Island of Dominica, which was severely hit by Tropical Storm Erika a few weeks ago. Minister of State, Joseph Harmon, was present at the Guyana National Industrial Company Incorporated (GNIC) Wharf earlier today, along with representatives of Fairfield Rice Incorporated, Tecnomills Guyana Incorporated and Sagrice Groups Incorporated, to witness the loading of the containers.

While making brief remarks on the occasion, Minister Harmon said the administration was very pleased to join forces with the members of the Private sector. This initiative, the Minister said, is a clear reflection of Guyana’s ability to respond in times of need.

“I think that this kind of collaboration between Government and the private sector is important to demonstrate to the rest of the world that Guyana is a place where we respond to wherever there is a need and we are a giving people,” Minister Harmon said.

Even as the Minister commended the Private sector for joining in the venture, he noted that the government is very pleased with the support shown since within only a matter of days, the quantity of rice for the shipment kept growing. “Initially when we spoke we were targeting 25 tons, but as the days went by more people came out to show their support in a more dynamic way,” Minister Harmon added.

This venture is a joint initiative, and includes assistance from GNIC, Tropical shipping, the Guyana Rice Development Board and the Civil Defence Commission. The tropical storm, which struck the small Caribbean island has not only left behind severe damage, but also 20 people dead.
