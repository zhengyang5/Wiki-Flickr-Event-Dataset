Police have confirmed at least 12 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in west London.
Earlier in the day, police confirmed six residents had died after the blaze took hold in the 24-storey block of flats near Latimer Road Tube station.
Mr Cundy said: "Sadly I can confirm that there are now 12 people that have died that we know of.
Other stories have emerged of those inside the tower who narrowly escaped the blaze.
A baby dropped from a window miraculously escaped serious harm, witnesses said, despite falling from the "ninth or tenth floor".
