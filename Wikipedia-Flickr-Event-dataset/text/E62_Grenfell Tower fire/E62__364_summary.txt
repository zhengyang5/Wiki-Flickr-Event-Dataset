The fire broke out at about 2am on Saturday in the 86-storey Torch tower on the northeast end of the densely populated district, which is packed with multi-storey skyscrapers.
Police blocked off areas around the 336 metre-high Torch tower, which still had power.
Rescue effortsTorch tower resident Steve Short, 53, of Liverpool, England, praised the work of firefighters who arrived quickly.
He said fire alarms alerted residents to the blaze and building management sent workers knocking on doors to ensure residents got out.
Cleanup crews dressed in orange uniforms swept up pieces of shattered glass and other debris covering the street outside the building.
