Emma Dent Coad, the Labour candidate and local councillor, overturned Borwick’s 7,000 majority by just 20 votes.
She took 16,333 (42.23%) of the vote compared with Borwick’s 16,313 (42.18%), representing a swing of 11.11% to Labour.
Supporters for all the candidates made their way back to the Kensington town hall for the count, although there was notably more supporters for Dent Coad.
The controversial Notting Hill carnival is held in the constituency, an event that Dent Coad supports.
The Labour MP said she would focus on the area’s problems, including air pollution and housing, to overcome “unforgivable inequalities”.
