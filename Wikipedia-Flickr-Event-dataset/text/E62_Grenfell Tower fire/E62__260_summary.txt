Danny Vance, an Associate Pastor at Notting Hill Community Church, said the deadly blaze at Grenfell Tower would not have happened in nearby “£5million flats” and that he wasn’t surprised by the fire.
Al least six people were killed when an inferno engulfed the 24-storey tower block in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
The charred wreck of the Notting Hill tower block is set to be examined to establish the cause of the fire.
