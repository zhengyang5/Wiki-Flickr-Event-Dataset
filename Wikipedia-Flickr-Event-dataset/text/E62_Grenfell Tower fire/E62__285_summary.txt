FIRE safety in council-owned housing stock in Brighton and Hove will be reviewed after the devastating Grenfell Tower blaze.
Brighton and Hove City Council responded by calling for an urgent review into fire safety in local authority-owned housing stock.
A spokesman also said plans were in place to add sprinkler systems to two high rise blocks in the city.
Residents suggested that new cladding, which had recently been installed as part of a refurbishment overseen by Sussex company Rydon, was to blame.
Both said they work closely with local authorities, housing associations and landlords to ensure high rise accommodation is safe.
