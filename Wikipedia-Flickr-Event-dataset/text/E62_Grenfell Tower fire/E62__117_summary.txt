Principal’s Welcome Spring 2018 I am delighted to welcome you to the Kensington Aldridge Academy (KAA) website.
As you will see, KAA is a growing 11 – 18 academy situated in the heart of North Kensington.
KAA is a school which has the very highest standards – both in terms of academic teaching and life beyond the classroom.
Our Sixth Form is also outstanding and is operated jointly with our independent school partners Charterhouse and Godolphin & Latymer.
Any current Year 11 students interested in applying to study with us in September should visit our Sixth Form pages.
