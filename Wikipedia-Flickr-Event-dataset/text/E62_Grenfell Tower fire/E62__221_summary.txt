Cyanide gas released by burning insulation on Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the deaths of some of the 79 victims, it has emerged.
Boards fitted during a refurbishment of the 24-storey block might have filled homes with the highly toxic substance when they caught fire, an expert has disclosed.
They could have produced enough deadly hydrogen cyanide to fill every flat at the west London high-rise, it has been reported.
Manufacturer Celotex confirmed that the insulation would have released "toxic gases" if it caught fire.
