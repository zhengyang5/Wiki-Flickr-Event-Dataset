At least 80 people are believed to have died as fire engulfed the Grenfell Tower block, in west London, on 14 June.
She added that one former Grenfell Tower resident had had rent deducted from their bank account since the tragedy.
Kensington and Chelsea council said to the best of its knowledge rent charges for Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk had been stopped.
But angry protests followed and Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, branded the abandoned meeting a "fiasco".
