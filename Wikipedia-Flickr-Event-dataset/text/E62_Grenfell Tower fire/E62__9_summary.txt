Relatives of three people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire hugged and wept as they exchanged condolences at inquest hearings.
Bernardâ€™s remains were recovered from his flat on the 23rd floor of Grenfell Tower and he was identified by dental records.
His mother, Berkti Haftom, 29, also died in the fire, and an inquest into her death was opened and suspended in July.
Wilcox suspended the inquests to allow the public inquiry and criminal investigation to proceed.
A preliminary hearing of the public inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired judge, is due to take place next week.
