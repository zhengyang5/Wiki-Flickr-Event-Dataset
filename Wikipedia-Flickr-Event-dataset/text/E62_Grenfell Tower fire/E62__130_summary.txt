Theresa May has announced a £5m fund for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire, as furious protests have gathered on the streets of Kensington and Westminster.
As well as the £5m, the Government has committed itself to ensuring that residents who have lost their homes will be rehoused within three weeks, as close as possible to Grenfell Tower.
Ms May told Sky News: "We are committed to ensuring that people are rehoused as far as possible within the borough, or in neighbouring boroughs.
"We are ensuring that within three weeks people will be rehoused so that they have a home to go to."
Earlier, in a statement, she said: “The individual stories I heard this morning at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital were horrific.
