Documents show contractors were asked to fit aluminium instead of more fire-resistant zinc, saving £300,000Fire-resistant zinc cladding approved by residents of Grenfell Tower was replaced in the refurbishment contract with cheaper aluminium panels to save £293,368, according to documents seen by the Guardian.
In 2012, Studio E Architects proposed zinc cladding with a mineral-rich “fire-retardant polyethylene core”, a decision approved by residents, according to planning papers.
However, it was replaced in 2014 with cheaper aluminium cladding with a polyethylene core which has since proved combustible in government tests.
The aluminium cladding is suspected of having helped spread the fire that claimed at least 80 lives.
In July 2014, KCTMO asked it to provide costings for the three different types of cheaper cladding.
