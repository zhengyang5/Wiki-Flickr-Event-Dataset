A teacher who lives in the area called on Kensington and Chelsea council to take control of the relief efforts.
Moyra Samuels told the meeting of around 70 people: "These are very uncoordinated (efforts) and my question is 'Where is the council?'
This is something that we cannot do without an enormous level of planning and coordination."
Ms Samuels said that donations such as food would begin deteriorating before they could be passed on to the fire victims.
"If the council is going to have to pay people to do that, that is what they are going to have to do," she added.
