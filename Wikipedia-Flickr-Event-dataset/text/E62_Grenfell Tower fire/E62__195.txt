On its website, Rydon Construction said: ‘Externally, rain screen cladding, curtain wall facade and replacement windows were fitted, improving thermal insulation and modernising the exterior of the building.’

More than 200 firefighters were sent to tackle the fire at the 27-storey Grenfell Tower which was reported just after 1.15am on Wednesday.

London Ambulance Service said that 30 people have been taken to five hospitals across the city, but that number is expected to rise.

Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Nick Paget-Brown described the blaze as a ‘very, very severe fire’.

He told Sky News: ‘Clearly it’s an absolutely devastating fire. Several hundred would have been in there. It’s a question of establishing how many people were in there at the time of the fire.

‘I’m really not in any position to answer any questions about the structure. Clearly there’s a lot more work to do to evacuate the building and to establish how safe it is.’

Actor and writer Tim Downie, who lives around 600 metres from the scene in Latimer Road, told the Press Association he feared the block could collapse.

He said: ‘It’s horrendous. The whole building is engulfed in flames. It’s gone. It’s just a matter of time before this building collapses.

He told the BBC: ‘I grabbed an axe from the fire truck, it looked like there was a bit of confusion about what to do.

‘I ran around the building looking for a fire escape and couldn’t see any noticeable fire escapes around the building. A lot of debris falling down.
