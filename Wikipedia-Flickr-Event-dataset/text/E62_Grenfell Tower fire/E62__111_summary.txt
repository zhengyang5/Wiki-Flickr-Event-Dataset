Theresa May has U-turned on a promise not to carry out immigration checks on Grenfell fire victims, leaving survivors who need help at risk of deportation if they come forward.
Downing Street confirmed to The Independent that what happens to survivors at that point would “depend on their circumstances”.
Jolyon Maugham QC, a prominent barrister who has volunteered to offer free legal services to Grenfell victims, said: “You can’t really call this an amnesty.
“For those who are undocumented, who know what fate awaits them at the end of 12 months, this ‘offer’ means nothing.
Ms Abbot said: “The partial amnesty is limited to 12 months, which does not go far enough.
