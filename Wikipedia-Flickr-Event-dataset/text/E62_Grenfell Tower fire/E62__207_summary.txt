At least 20 tower blocks across the capital, ranging from 11 to 23 storeys, are believed to have the same cladding used at Grenfell, according to Construction Enquirer, a trade publication.
Fire Safe Europe has asked the European Commission to drop small-scale tests of building materials in favour of large-scale tests that demonstrate how cladding and other materials behave in real fires.
In addition to changes in fire performance tests, the body called for further tests to record the toxic chemicals released in smoke produced by building materials when they catch fire.
“We should be saying no combustible materials on buildings above 18m.”Jim Glockling, technical director at the Fire Protection Association, an industry body, said that while it can be acceptable to use combustible materials on buildings, they must be fitted properly with other fire protection measures to ensure any outbreak is held back long enough for residents to escape.
It’s because the modern methods of construction and the materials used increase the combustible content,” he said.
