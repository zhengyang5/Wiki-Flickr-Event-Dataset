Director of public prosecutions says it could take months before charging decisions can be madeThe director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, has not ruled out possible criminal charges carrying lengthy prison sentences against individuals over the Grenfell Tower fire.
In her first public comments since the disaster, she said investigations were at a very early stage.
Gross negligence manslaughter is among offences prosecutors could consider if police find sufficient evidence.
The offence carries a maximum sentence of life in prison for those found to have high levels of culpability.
Saunders described Grenfell as a “shocking, terrible tragedy”.
