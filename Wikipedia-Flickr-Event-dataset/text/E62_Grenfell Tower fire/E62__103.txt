Kensington and Chelsea council has been relieved of responsibility for taking care of the survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster.

The work is being handed over to a new Grenfell Fire Response Team, made up of representatives from central government, the British Red Cross, the Metropolitan police, London-wide local and regional government, and the London Fire Brigade.

It is embarrassing for the council, the wealthiest in the country, to have had to cede control.

Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark council :

We want to make clear that whilst the emergency and local community response was nothing short of heroic, we know that the initial response was simply not good enough on the ground. People are angry, and rightfully so. Our focus is now ensuring those affected are being cared for and looked after.

The team is to provide 24-hour access to services and support at the Westway sport and fitness centre. Help is to be provided for housing, funds, health, social care, food and advice.

Kelly said:

Housing is our main priority. We will organise and speed up the rehousing process. We are currently working with those affected households to establish what their housing need is â€“ as you can appreciate this takes time. By the end of Monday, 19 June, we aim to have contacted all known families affected by the fire and completed an assessment of what they need. The latest information we have is that 201 households have received emergency accommodation to date, of which 113 are homeless.

The British Red Cross, which has been involved since Wednesday, has a team of more than 60 volunteers to provide help. They will help distribute donations and meet grieving relatives as they arrive at airports.
