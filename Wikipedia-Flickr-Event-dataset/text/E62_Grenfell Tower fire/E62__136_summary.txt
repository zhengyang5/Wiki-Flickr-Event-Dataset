Yesterday, it was announced that a newly formed Grenfell Fire Response Team would assume the lead role in handling the disaster, including helping the victims who were made homeless.
The new taskforce includes London-wide local and regional government, central government, British Red Cross, the Metropolitan Police and London Fire Brigade.
“Our focus is now ensuring those affected are being cared for and looked after.”John Barradell, City of London Corporation chief executive, is leading the response team.
Kelly is one of several London-based council chief executives also involved in the response team.
The prime minister also ordered councils across the country to complete urgent safety checks on similar tower blocks and that if needed action “will be taken” to address safety issues in these buildings.
