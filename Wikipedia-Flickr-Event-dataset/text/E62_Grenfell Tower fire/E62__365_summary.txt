Flames shot up the side of the skyscraper, sending debris tumbling from the 337m (1,106 ft) structure.
One resident told Reuters people were screaming as they woke to the late-night blaze before having to flee.
It is not clear what caused the fire in the 79-storey skyscraper, but it is the second blaze to hit the building in two years.
The Torch Tower was damaged by an earlier blaze in 2015, which resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of people.
