Council expert said pipes serving flats must be protected with fire-retardant boxing but, by time of fire, two-thirds were still bareDozens of exposed gas pipes in Grenfell Tower that caused residents to fear for their safety were left bare despite a council safety expert ordering them to be protected by fire-retardant boxing.
They requested an urgent safety report to show the building is “safe from fire hazard”, according to correspondence seen by the Guardian.
The works were originally undertaken by the National Grid’s gas distribution arm following a leak.
Cadent said the “work was still ongoing to box in the lateral pipes [horizontal pipes to flats]” when the fire occurred.
Kensington and Chelsea council declined to comment on the warnings about the gas pipes from the leaseholders group.
