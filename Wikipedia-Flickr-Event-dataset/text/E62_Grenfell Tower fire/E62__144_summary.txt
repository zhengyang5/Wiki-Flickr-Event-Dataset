Theresa May has ordered an emergency meeting to ensure the authorities are best prepared to help tackle the fallout from the deadly Grenfell Tower blaze.
With questions already being asked as to the responsibility of both local and national government, Ms May ordered the gathering this afternoon.
A Number 10 spokesman said: “The Prime Minister is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in the Grenfell Tower and is being kept constantly updated on the situation.
Mr Khan condemned the "bad advice" given to residents of the West London tower block that was engulfed in flames overnight, killing several inhabitants and leaving many trapped inside the burning building.
A newsletter to residents in 2014 said the "stay put" policy worked because the block had been designed according to “rigorous fire safety standards”.
