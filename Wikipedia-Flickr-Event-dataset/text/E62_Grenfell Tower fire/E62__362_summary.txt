Following a three-year wait, work to repair the tower finally began last year, at a cost of $13.5 million, a well placed source told Arabian Business in December.
The statement said: “Orient Insurance has sought to comply with all requirements of the authorities to ensure the repair of Tamweel Tower in a professional and proper manner.
“The cladding material and system installed on Tamweel Tower has a specification recommended by the involved professionals following discussion and interaction with the concerned authorities.
“We have stressed to the consultants that they must continue to explore all potential avenues in order for this matter to be progressed at the earliest possible opportunity...“We would stress that this problem is not unique to Tamweel Tower.
Frustration levels were pretty high three years ago [when the repair work had not yet begun].
