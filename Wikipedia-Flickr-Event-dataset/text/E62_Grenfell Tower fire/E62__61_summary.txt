05:57Dozens of residents, some tearful and distraught, have come to Latymer community church, which is providing shelter and support for affected residents and their families.
Positioned just north-west of Grenfell Tower, volunteers have arrived at the church in droves to help.
As the Guardian arrived, a man collapsed in his chair in tears before becoming faint and needing medical assistance.
A doctor rushed to help and a wheelchair was provided to take him into the church.
The Rev Steve Divall, from nearby St Helenâ€™s church, prayed with some residents in the street outside Latymer community church.
