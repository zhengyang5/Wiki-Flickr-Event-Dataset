BBC Newsnight investigatesA series of failings that hampered the efforts of firefighters to tackle the Grenfell Tower fire and rescue the building's residents have been identified by a BBC investigation.
Crews cited low water pressure, radio problems and equipment that was either lacking or did not arrive before the fire on 14 June got out of control.
About 300 people are believed to have lived in Grenfell Tower and most got out on their own.
"The Brigade's pre-determined attendance to high rise buildings had already been increased in June 2015 from three fire engines to four as part of our ongoing review of high rise firefighting.
The LFB spokesman said it had never responded to a fire on the scale of Grenfell Tower before.
