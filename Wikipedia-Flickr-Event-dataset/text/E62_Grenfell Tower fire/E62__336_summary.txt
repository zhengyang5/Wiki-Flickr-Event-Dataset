Police say "extensive investigations" led them to conclude 350 people should have been in the Kensington tower block on the night of the blaze on 14 June.
Detective Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers, leading the Met's operation, described the task as "unprecedented".
Unless major flaws are found in the way detectives have attempted to get the truth, its likely the final number of dead at Grenfell Tower will be around 80.
There are 250 specialist investigators working on the Met's operation, including the process of identifying those who died, and finding out how the fire started.
