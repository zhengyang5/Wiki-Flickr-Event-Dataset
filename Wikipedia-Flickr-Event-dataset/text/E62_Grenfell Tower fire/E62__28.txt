The external cladding blamed for the ferocity and speed of the Grenfell Tower blaze has been fitted to dozens — and possibly hundreds — of other towers across London, it was claimed today.

Councils have been keen to cover the outside of ageing concrete blocks dating from the Sixties and Seventies with coloured panels to make them look less of an eyesore and also improve their environmental performance by reducing heat loss.

However, experts argue they can fatally weaken the fire prevention defences built into the structure of buildings by letting flames jump very fast up the outside of buildings, fuelled by a disastrous “chimney” effect.

Although exact numbers are not known, Matthew Needham-Laing, head of construction at lawyer Katten Law UK, said that of the 4,000 old tower blocks left in Britain “a large proportion will have been clad” to extend their usable lifespans.

Some of those refurbished by Rydon, the contractor that worked on the Grenfell Tower, include Ferrier Point in Canning Town and five towers on the Chalcot Estate in Camden. Southwark alone has 317 tall towers, more than any other UK local authority area.

Mr Needham-Laing added: "If indeed this is a cladding-related fire, as seems likely, it will not have been the first and will not be the last in a series of such fires.

“Building regulations have not caught up with these new materials, specifically in relation to fire standards. ‘Stay in your flats’ is perfectly sensible advice in a general brick building, where a standard fire door can last 30 minutes, providing enough time for rescue. But this cladding causes fire to jump over the fire-breaks and up the side of the building, rendering current building regulations moot.

“Regulations were last updated in 2013 but we’ve since had a rash of cladding-related fires in Dubai, China and other markets with these materials.”

The findings came amid accusations about a growing litany of failures and inadequacies at Grenfell Tower, including a lack of sprinklers, effective alarms and the single staircase for escape. Planning documents show that the metal skin on the outside of panels was originally designed to be made of zinc, which has a relatively high melt point but ignites when it reaches 900C. However, updates suggest this was changed to aluminium, which has a lower 600C melt point but does not ignite.

There were also questions about whether the “fire stops” supposed to be in the cavity between the cladding’s insulation and its outer metal skin were installed. Without them fire can rise rapidly through the cavity.

Niall Rowan, chief operating officer of the Association for Specialist Fire Protection, said: “I have seen video taken last night which shows very narrow fire spread up the side of the building. It took only around 30 seconds for a plume no wider than a metre to go right up to the top of the building.”

The insulation panels are believe to have been made by Suffolk-based Celotex, owned by French building materials giant St Gobain. The panels used met the highest grading level for fire retardant qualities.

A spokesman said: “Our thoughts are with those affected by the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower. Our records show a Celotex product (RS5000) was purchased for use in refurbishing the building. If required, we will assist with enquiries from the relevant authorities at the appropriate time.”
