The extraordinary community effort to help the victims of the Grenfell Tower blaze on Wednesday brought together pop stars, celebrity chefs and even the wife of former prime minister David Cameron.

But joining the likes of Samantha Cameron, Jamie Oliver and Lily Allen, were also hundreds of volunteers and neighbours of all races, ages and class. It was, to sum it up, a very London effort.

Churches and community centres opened their doors from first light to accommodate those rescued from the blazing building and evacuated from surrounding homes.
