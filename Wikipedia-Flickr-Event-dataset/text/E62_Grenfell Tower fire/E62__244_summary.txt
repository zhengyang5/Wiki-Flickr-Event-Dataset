The London fire brigade has said it hopes “lessons are learned” after a council was fined £570,000 over safety failings at a 14-storey block of flats where six people died in a fire.
Three women and three children were trapped by flames that spread out of control at Lakanal House in Camberwell, south London, in 2009, as a result of safety deficiencies in the block.
At Southwark crown court on Tuesday, Judge Jeffrey Pegden told Southwark council, the landlord of Lakanal House, that it must pay a £270,000 fine, plus £300,000 costs.
London fire brigade (LFB) brought the prosecution against Southwark after inspectors visited Lakanal House after the fire and found a number of structural and safety issues.
“Bringing this prosecution against Southwark council has been about ensuring that lessons are learned.
