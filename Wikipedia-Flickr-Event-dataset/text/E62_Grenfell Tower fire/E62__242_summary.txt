Theresa May has appointed an effective “deputy prime minister” as part of her fightback to stay in No 10 after her election disaster.
Long-time friend Damian Green was made First Secretary of State and Minister for the Cabinet Office, as the delayed Cabinet reshuffle got underway.
However, the last of three key Brexiteer Cabinet ministers, Liam Fox, will remain as Secretary of State for International Trade.
Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said he did not want MPs to have to wait until Tuesday for the crucial inquest with the Prime Minister.
“One of the things I've said to the Prime Minister is it's very important that she speaks to colleagues as soon as possible,” Mr Brady told the BBC.
