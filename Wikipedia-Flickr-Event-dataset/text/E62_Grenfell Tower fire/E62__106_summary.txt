Met commander says officers have made 87 recoveries but cannot confirm they come from 87 peoplePolice investigating the Grenfell Tower fire have recovered 87 sets of human remains but cannot confirm they are from 87 individuals.
In an update on the investigation, the Metropolitan police commander, Stuart Cundy, said: “In total we have made 87 recoveries, but I must stress that the catastrophic damage inside Grenfell Tower means that is not 87 people.”These were last of the visible human remains left in the Tower, he said.
Cundy said: “This will involve us meticulously going through about 15.5 tonnes of debris on each floor to find those human remains that are still within the debris inside Grenfell Tower.
“We will use all the information we have, especially what we have been told by survivors and families, to prioritise our search where we believe we may find more human remains.
“It is vitally important that families and loved ones are engaged and know what we are doing and why.
