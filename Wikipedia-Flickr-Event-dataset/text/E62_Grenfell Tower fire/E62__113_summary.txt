The one-year immigration amnesty for undocumented residents of Grenfell Tower is a “travesty” and will jeopardise the public inquiry into the fire, lawyers said as the deadline for signing up was extended.
Ismet Rawat, from BMELawyers4Grenfell, told HuffPost UK that she is not aware of anyone who has taken up the offer of the 12-month amnesty.
BMELawyers4Grenfell is calling for a full amnesty for all undocumented residents of Grenfell Tower and others who may have been in the building at the time of the fire from the outset.
“The one-year so-called amnesty was a travesty, providing no real protection and leaving any such residents at peril of immediate deportation once that 12 months ended,” Rawat said.
There are two reasons why undocumented residents of Grenfell Tower should be given full amnesty, she added.
