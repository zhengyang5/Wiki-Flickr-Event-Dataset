A panel of people drawn from the local community should be appointed to advise the chair of the Grenfell Tower inquiry, according to the bishop whose diocese covers the building where the deadly inferno took place.
The bishop of Kensington said that judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick should establish a panel that would “represent the local community and win their confidence” in a submission to the inquiry.
Moore-Bick has been criticised by North Kensington residents and politicians, who have suggested he lacks the confidence of local people.
According to sources close to the inquiry, Moore-Bick is considering recommending an advisory panel in his letter to May, which will be sent to Downing Street next week.
After the terms of reference have been set, the inquiry will contact organisations relevant to its investigation, such as the local council, KCTMO and fire brigade.
