Building safety experts have warned that government tests on tower block cladding in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster lack transparency and are too simplistic to be used to condemn blocks as unsafe.
Councils in Liverpool, London and Plymouth have ordered the removal of panels following the tests and follow-up inspections by fire experts.
“The government is fundamentally flawed in its use of the BRE to conduct overly simplistic and limited fire test samples and not the complete cladding assembly,” said Stephen Mackenzie, a fire risk consultant.
Cutting off and testing a piece of the aluminium cladding would not tell the government’s testers anything about that wider context.
The combustibility test has three categories and cladding in category two or three fails the building regulations’ limited combustibility requirement according to the DCLG.
