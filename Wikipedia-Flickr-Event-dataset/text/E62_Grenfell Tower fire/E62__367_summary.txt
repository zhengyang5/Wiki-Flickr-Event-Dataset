A perspective on high rise building fires involving the façadeThe recent fire that occurred on the 9th November 2016 involving the Neo-Soho project in Jakarta has left a desire to look at the phenomena of external fire spread in high rise buildings.
Over the past 10 years we have seen many high rise building fires that have spread into the outer facade cladding systems, and then rapidly developed both vertically and horizontally across the façade face of the building.
Materials used within a façade system include:A moisture barrier; Thermal insulation; Decorative external finish (cladding).
Fires do no generally begin outside of the building, in or on the façade.
Moisture barriers of bitumen origin may have a low flame spread index under ideal fire test conditions, but on the other hand can attribute to flame spread within the façade cavity.
