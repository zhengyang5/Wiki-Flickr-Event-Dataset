A video of the meeting shows Sir Martin Moore-Bick saying he would "find the facts as I see them from the evidence".
Joe Delaney, of the Grenfell Action Group, told the BBC that Sir Martin was not jeered or booed, but people were sceptical about him.
Sir Martin said he had been invited to the meeting on Thursday by the Lancaster West Residents Association.
Mr Delaney told BBC Radio 5 live that Sir Martin: "You could hear people sighing and tutting."
Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, of Kensington and Chelsea Council, called on Sir Martin to publish regular updates to residents to take them through the inquiry.
