No buildings in UK known to have combination of cladding, filling and insulation fire safety tests deem safeA series of fire safety tests designed to investigate cladding systems on high-rises have concluded, finding 228 buildings at risk across the UK, the government said.
It is understood that the last cladding system examined was considered the least dangerous option out of the seven tested.
The so-called “whole system” tests were designed to see how different cladding systems reacted in a fire, before determining if they complied with building regulations.
Different measures have been put in place at the hundreds of buildings determined to be at risk after the fire safety tests.
The government-backed assessments followed an initial round of combustibility tests on the cladding samples alone, which were criticised for being too limited.
