Kensington and Chelsea council has been relieved of responsibility for taking care of the survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
The work is being handed over to a new Grenfell fire response team, made up of representatives from central government, the British Red Cross, the Metropolitan police, London-wide local and regional government and the London fire brigade.
The response team will provide 24-hour access to services and support at the Westway sport and fitness centre.
The Labour leader on the council, Robert Atkinson, said the leadership had lost all credibility.
Eve Allison, a Conservative councillor, said last yearâ€™s refurbishment of Grenfell Tower should have looked inside as well as outside the building.
