The type of cladding used at Grenfell Tower was reportedly banned in Germany.
The residents were told they should be able to return to their homes as soon as the cladding had been removed.
Since the 14 June Grenfell Tower fire, authorities have begun inspecting flats across England and found that cladding on 95 high-rise buildings is unsafe.
At the weekend, hundreds of flats were evacuated from the Camden area of north London because of safety concerns over cladding and other fire risks.
They were due to be moved to flats that had been intended for refugees but were now empty.
