I’ve overseen numerous projects across London, including new builds and refurbishments, making sure buildings comply with the proper regulations, and post-occupation fire risk assessments.
Given my experience, I was shocked by the blaze which engulfed Grenfell Tower in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
At this point in time it’s very hard to tell precisely what went wrong.
We don’t know where the fire started and we don’t know how it spread.
If regulations were followed, what happened at Grenfell Tower...
