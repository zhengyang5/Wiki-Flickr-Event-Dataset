The Fire Brigades Union said during the fire "access was an issue", with "huge difficulties" getting past parked cars.
Access 'restricted'Plans to build a new academy school at the foot of Grenfell Tower were opposed by many residents, who felt the area was already congested.
An email sent in 2010 to councillors by local resident Francis O'Connor, a member of the Grenfell Action Group, said the plans meant emergency access to Grenfell Tower would "certainly be compromised".
A Grenfell Action Group blog post from January 2013 warned about access to the southern side of the tower.
It read: "There is barely adequate room to manoeuvre for fire engines responding to emergency calls, and any obstruction of this emergency access zone could have lethal consequences in the event of a serious fire or similar emergency in Grenfell Tower or the adjacent blocks."
