Theresa May has apologised for a “failure of the state” over the Grenfell Fire disaster that killed at least 79 people.
“That was a failure of the state, local and national, to help people when they needed it most.
Residents of Grenfell Tower are reported to have warned repeatedly that their building was not safe.
The homes, which is about 1.5 miles from Grenfell Tower, have been purchased by the Corporation of London and will be used as social housing.
It comes after Jeremy Corbyn called for Grenfell residents to be housed in empty homes in Kensington.
