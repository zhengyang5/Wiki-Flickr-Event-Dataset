A fire brigade spokesman said it did not "sign off" the refurbishment.
Chaired by retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, it will cover the design, construction and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower as well as the response of the London Fire Brigade.
Documents seen by the BBC show "close liaison" between the Tenant Management Organisation and the London Fire Brigade "throughout the duration of the project".
He added he could not confirm the exact contact the LFB had with the TMO regarding Grenfell Tower because the public inquiry had begun.
