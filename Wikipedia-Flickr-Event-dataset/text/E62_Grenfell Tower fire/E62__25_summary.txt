A long chain of companies was responsible for refurbishing Grenfell Tower, raising concerns among architectural and fire safety experts about the quality of oversight and accountability on the £10m project of 2015-16.
Grenfell Tower is also absent from the websites of several companies involved, many of which list the other projects they have worked on as case studies intended to demonstrate excellence.
Planning documents and local authority reports revealed a long list of companies that won lucrative contracts to work on Grenfell Tower.
Harley Facades said it had bought the insulation – charred pieces of which are now littering the ground around Grenfell Tower – from Celotex, based in Ipswich.
A case study of Grenfell Tower was not available on that company’s website Wednesday but reappeared on Thursday.
