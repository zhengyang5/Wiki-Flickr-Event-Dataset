Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has been confronted over the Prime Minister not meeting survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
While being interviewed by Sky News near the tower block in west London, Mrs Leadsom was repeatedly challenged by angry residents, some who yelled: "Meet the victims!"
Nadir, 24, who has friends in Grenfell Tower, said: "At least she (Theresa May) could've met the victims, (Jeremy) Corbyn was a good man... he came and met the people.
Mrs Leadsom later denied the row represented a threat to Mrs May's leadership.
Nadir tackled Mrs Leadsom over why sprinklers had not been fitted in Grenfell Tower during a recent Â£8.6m refurbishment.
