When, amid all the millions of words uttered about Grenfell, are we finally going to focus on the real cause of that fire?
A comment on my column last week said that “only Booker could get a link between Grenfell, the EU and global warming into a single article”.
But that is precisely the point.
Without those two factors, the fire could never have happened.
As I had written, all this talk about “cladding” has been looking in wholly the wrong direction.
