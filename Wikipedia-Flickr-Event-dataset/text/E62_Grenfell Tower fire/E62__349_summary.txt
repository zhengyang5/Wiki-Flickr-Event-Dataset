The warning comes a year after a tower block fire in west London, started by a faulty tumble dryer.
The letter says: "A year on, people across the UK are still using white goods that pose a serious fire risk and are subject to recall or corrective action.
'Sleeping risk'There have been 2,170 fires in London involving white goods since 2010, the fire brigade said.
"The terrible tragedy at Grenfell Tower in June is a stark reminder of just how devastating a fire caused by faulty white goods can be," he said.
Consumer Minister Margot James said the government already has a "robust system" to inform people of faulty goods.
