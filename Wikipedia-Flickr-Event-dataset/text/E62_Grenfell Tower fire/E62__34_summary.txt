Emergency services are to spend a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington.
The prime minister - who faced criticism for not meeting survivors of the tragedy on a visit to the scene on Thursday - said the victims "deserve answers".
But former cabinet minister Michael Portillo said the prime minister "didn't use her humanity".
Conservative MP Chris Philip later told Newsnight the prime minister was "keen not to intrude and cause disruption".
Rydon, the company that carried out the Â£8.6m refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, said it welcomed Mrs May's announcement of the public inquiry.
