Newly formed Grenfell Tower residents’ groups have begun several parallel investigative attempts to compile lists of the victims and survivors of the London fire disaster, amid ongoing concern that the police and council have been slow to release information about the death toll.
Jamalvatan said he was trying to compile a database of survivors on behalf of his neighbours.
They said 145 hotel rooms have been provided to former residents, but they were unable to release a number of survivors.
“There has been no update on a) the death toll, b) the number of survivors or c) the number of people in Grenfell Tower for over a week,” he wrote.
Survivors visiting the Rugby Portobello Trust, where there is a community centre for victims, have also been helping to compile an informal list of victims and survivors.
