A resident of Grenfell Tower has described seeing the ‘small’ kitchen fire – that would later spread and destroy the entire building.
Maryam Adam, a 41-year-old pregnant woman, lived next door to Flat 16 – where the blaze started in the early hours of the morning.
She said that her neighbour woke her and others up after packing some of his bags, and they were all ushered out into the street before the flames engulfed the block.
‘The fire started in the flat next door to mine on the fourth floor,’ she said.
I could see it because the flat door was open.
