Leaseholders in an apartment block covered in Grenfell-style cladding have been ordered to pay £500,000 to make their building safe after a tribunal ruled that they, rather than the management company, were obliged to cover the costs.
Soon after the Grenfell Tower fire it was estimated that the cost of replacing the combustible cladding was about £500,000, but it later received estimates that the cost could be up to £2.4m.
He said leaseholders could mount legal challenges against the London borough of Croydon “if there were errors in certification process”.
“As the property manager, we will continue to support everyone at Citiscape and work to minimise the costs of recladding, while putting residents’ safety first at all times.
“It is crystal clear the government was responsible for allowing this cladding to go up so the government must accept responsibility for taking it down.”
