London Fire Brigade has denied it signed off the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower amid reports the service was consulted over renovation works before the devastating blaze.
There was "close liaison" between the fire brigade and Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) during the project, documents show.
Firefighters were reportedly shown the "fire safety features of the building" after the work was completed last summer.
But London Fire Brigade said it did not have the legal powers to inspect cladding or structural changes to buildings.
