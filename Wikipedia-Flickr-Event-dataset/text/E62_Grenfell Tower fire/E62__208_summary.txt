The polyethylene filling in cladding panels used at Grenfell Tower and at least 60 other tower blocks has been given the lowest fire-safety rating during tests carried by the Building Research EstablishmentThe Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has released results from the first of six tests aimed at testing different cladding systems.
It found that the 3mm filling in the panels used at Grenfell Tower achieved a category three rating, meaning it has no flame retardant properties.
Communities secretary Sajid Javid said: â€˜It is clear we need to urgently look at Building Regulations and fire safety.
Another 30 seconds later, the rate of flaming droplets was sufficient to fuel growth of the fire at the base of the cladding.
It took less than nine minutes for flames to reach several metres beyond the top of the rig.
