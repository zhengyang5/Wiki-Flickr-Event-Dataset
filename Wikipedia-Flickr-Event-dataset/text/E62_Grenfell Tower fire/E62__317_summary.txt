Charges being considered by police investigating the Grenfell Tower fire include manslaughter, corporate manslaughter, misconduct in public office and breaches of fire safety legislation, the public inquiry into the disaster has heard.
Mr Johnson said individual manslaughter offences were still on the table, meaning officials could be jailed for their role in the disaster.
Mr Millett said CPs were made up of 60 families of the deceased, 193 Grenfell Tower residents, four leaseholders, 124 residents from the surrounding walkways, one survivor from neither Grenfell Tower or the walkways and 26 CPs who are organisations, including the council, the council’s tenant management organisation and Scotland Yard.
He added that the fire at Grenfell Tower was an “utterly appalling event and the experiences of it are stamped on the memories” of those who lived there or lost loved ones.
Jeremy Corbyn said a failure to rehouse most of the Grenfell Tower fire survivors after six months was disgraceful.
