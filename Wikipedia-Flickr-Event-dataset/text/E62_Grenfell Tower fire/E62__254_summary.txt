The residents of the Grenfell Tower block have been failed and betrayed by the local council, the new Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, has said, expressing fury at the way Kensington and Chelsea treats its social housing tenants.
“The council want to develop this area full of social housing, and in order to enable that they have prettified a building that they felt was ugly ...
“People in Grenfell Tower have been complaining that the aesthetic refit hadn’t helped them at all.
Their vision for social housing means that they get away with poor construction and we have seen the effect of that elsewhere”.
She is also frustrated at the council’s poor record of listening to tenants’ concerns.
