Theresa May showed failed to show "humanity" when she refused to meet survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy, a former cabinet minister has said.
Michael Portillo said the Prime Minister "didn't use her humanity"when she visited the scene of the blaze yesterday.
She met police and firefighters dealing with the aftermath of the disaster during a private visit to the west London site.
