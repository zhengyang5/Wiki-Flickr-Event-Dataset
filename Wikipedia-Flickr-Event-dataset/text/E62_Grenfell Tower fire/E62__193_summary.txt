The cladding system on Grenfell Tower was reportedly passed by a building control officer from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea on 15 May 2015, despite a nationwide warning that the combustible insulation it featured should only be used in conjunction with cladding that does not burn.
One states confidently: “Grenfell was designed according to rigorous fire safety standards.”The council has already said its building control officers went on site 16 times during construction, and its building control manager certified the Grenfell works as being in line with building regulations on completion in 2016.
Some observers have questioned how the cladding system, which burned so ferociously in a blaze that claimed at least 80 lives, could have complied with regulations.
Residents’ newsletters sent out from April 2014 to May 2016 suggest that the cladding and fire measures were high-profile issues.
In February 2015, the client and contractor reported “regular visits from RBKC building control officers … working closely with us to ensure that all technical aspects of the work meet the requisite regulations”.
