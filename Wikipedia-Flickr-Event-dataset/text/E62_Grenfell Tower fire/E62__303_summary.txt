Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The Grenfell Tower fire claimed the lives of 71 people in June 2017Building regulations are leaving room for shortcuts, the woman leading a review into fire safety after the Grenfell Tower blaze has said.
In her interim report, Dame Judith Hackitt said she was "shocked" by some of the practices she had seen, calling for better enforcement to "hold to account those who try to cut corners."
Her review is aimed at making sure similar events do not happen in the future, rather than investigating the specific circumstances at Grenfell.
"While Dame Judith continues her vital work, we are continuing to support wider work to make existing buildings safer," he said.
Dame Judith is due appear in front of the Commons' local government committee to discuss the report.
