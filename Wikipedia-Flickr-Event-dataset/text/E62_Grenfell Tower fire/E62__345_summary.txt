One angry resident said: ''How can an elderly, disabled man who has already had a fire be moved to another high-rise flat in the same block?
Mrs Ellen Blackley, 59, one of the first tenants to move into the council block in 1965, said a passing motorist raised the alarm by shouting a warning from the street below.
Locals who gathered outside the blackened tower block said more people could have died if many residents had not been outside enjoying the sunshine.
Building control officers from North Ayrshire Council, which owns the block, were last night checking to determine whether it is structurally safe.
In Glasgow yesterday, an 89-year-old man died after falling from the window of his 10th floor home in Berryknowes Road, Cardonald.
