After firefighters battled the blaze at Grenfell Tower in London early on Wednesday, they turned to a drone for help surveying the damage.
Kent Fire and Rescue Service, a department about an hour southeast of London, supplied its drone to the London Fire Brigade, the Kent department said in a statement.
It first used a drone to survey a warehouse site where a blaze had killed four firefighters in November 2007.
The Manchester fire department’s drone, which it acquired in 2015, can fly up to 50 minutes, as high as 400 feet, and as far as 3.1 miles from the controller.
“After a fire, a building can sometimes be too dangerous,” Adam Green, station manager at the Kent Fire and Rescue Service, told a local outlet last September.
