Hundreds of residents of four London tower blocks have spent the night in emergency accommodation after they were told to leave their homes amid fire safety fears.
Ms Gould added: "I know this is difficult but...I don't believe we can take any risks with our residents' safety and I have to put them first.
In a statement issued at 1.24am, a spokesman for Camden Council said: "So far we have secured hundreds of hotel beds for Chalcots residents.
The Chalcots estate has five tower blocks - four 22 storey blocks and one 18 storey block.
PM: My thoughts are with residents being evacuated in Camden while their homes are made safe tonight.
