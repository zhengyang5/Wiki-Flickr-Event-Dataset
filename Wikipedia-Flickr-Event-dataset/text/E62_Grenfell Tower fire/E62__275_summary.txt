It is a dangerous moment for any government when the public suspects that it is incapable of preventing a great disaster like the Grenfell Tower fire.
Whatever the real culpability, it is vital to play for time in the expectation that the news agenda will ultimately move on.
It is already known that the cladding that encased the tower was inflammable and led to the building igniting like a torch within 15 minutes.
This is very different from the Grenfell Tower disaster, visually overwhelming even as a burned-out hulk, as were the shattered towers of the World Trade Centre on 9/11.
Everything about the disaster conveys a sense of total failure in which the whole political system is implicated.
