They were taken on as volunteers and the service has since decided to employ an extra four full-time counsellors.
The BBC understands there was the equivalent of 9.6 full-time counsellors working for the brigade in 2008.
The London Fire Brigade is using its reserve budget to pay for the extra counsellors.
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.
