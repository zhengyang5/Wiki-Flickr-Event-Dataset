A resident who managed to escape from the 15th floor of London’s Grenfell Tower as a fire engulfed the building said he feels “lucky to be alive”.
Christos Fairbairn said he “will never forget” the harrowing experience and “will never live in a tower block again”.
He added that he was “tripping over bodies” in the darkness as he tried to make his way to the stairs.
The 41-year-old, who moved into the west London tower block two years ago, said he was watching television when he heard an alarm go off and saw smoke starting to seep into his flat.
“I know I will never live in a tower block again.”
