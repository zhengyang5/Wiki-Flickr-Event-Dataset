Theresa May has called for a "major national investigation" into the use of potentially flammable cladding in high-rise towers in the wake of the Grenfell fire.
A Number 10 spokesperson said: "The Prime Minister said there would need to be a major national investigation into what had gone wrong when cladding which is failing the tests had been fitted on buildings across the country over a number of decades."
:: Five-year-old boy identified as Grenfell victimExternal cladding was blamed for the rapid spread of the fire at west London's Grenfell Tower on 14 June.
The Government has rejected any suggestions of a cover-up in the number of people killed in the fire.
Prince Charles visited a relief centre helping survivors from the tower fire, and praised volunteers for their "fantastic" work.
