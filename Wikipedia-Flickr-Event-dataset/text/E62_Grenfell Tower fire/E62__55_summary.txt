It’s a nightmare.”Abdul Kadiri, who lives nearby, was reunited with a friend who lived on the 15th floor of Grenfell Tower, and who called Mr. Kadiri as flames licked the building.
“I told him to grab his family and get out, and he hung up,” Mr. Kadiri recalled.
Another neighborhood resident, Alison Evans, woke to the sound of sirens and helicopters and watched flames engulf the building from a nearby street.
“It just kept burning and burning for hours, and for hours there were still people at the top of the building screaming for help,” she said.
“It was hell to watch.”Another resident, Mohammed Bouya, said he could hear people screaming for help from their windows.
