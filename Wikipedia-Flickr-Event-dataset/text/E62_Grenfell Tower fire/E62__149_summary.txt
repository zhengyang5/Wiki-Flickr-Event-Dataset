In the two long days since the first flames licked up the newly fixed cladding on Grenfell Tower in west London, the prime minister has failed to show any of these qualities.
The inferno at Grenfell Tower in which 17 people are now known to have died begins to look like Britainâ€™s Hurricane Katrina.
And, like Katrina, Grenfell Tower is proving more than a test of leadership.
This is only the start of what is necessary for the survivors of Grenfell Tower.
But it is too little and maybe too late for a prime minister whose approval ratings have crashed, whose government is in crisis, and whose authority seems to be draining away.
