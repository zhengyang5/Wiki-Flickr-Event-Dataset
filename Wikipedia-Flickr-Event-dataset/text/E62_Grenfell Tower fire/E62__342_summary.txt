Former villaThe remembrance service will be led by the island's Bishop the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles.
Summerland is on the site of a former villa which was converted into a theatre and ballroom in 1877.
Douglas Corporation bought it in 1964, developing the site as the Summerland Complex which opened in 1971.
The fire, sparked by three boys illicitly smoking, killed between 50 and 53 people and gutted the complex within minutes.
The Summerland disaster led to a major change in fire regulations on the Isle of Man and in the UK.
