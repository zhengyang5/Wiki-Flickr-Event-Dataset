The London Underground network is disrupted in west London amid concerns debris from Grenfell Tower could fall on the tracks.

The Circle and Hammersmith and City lines are both partly suspended on Saturday.

London Fire Brigade said the lines are temporarily closed because of a ‘short-term risk of some debris falling onto the tracks’.

A spokesman said crews are working to secure the debris in order for the lines to be reopened as soon as possible.

Transport for London’s website said there is no service on the Hammersmith and City line between Edgware Road and Hammersmith due to the fire in the Latimer Road area.

The Circle Line is closed due to planned engineering work as well as the fire, TfL said.

Tickets for both lines are valid on local buses.

Adding to the chaos, the District line is also partly suspended with westbound services stopping at South Kensington – though this is due to planned engineering work.

The death toll for the fire stands at 30, but the Met Police said the number is likely to increase significantly.
