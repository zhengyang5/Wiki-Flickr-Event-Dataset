People who were unlawfully subletting flats in Grenfell Tower will not be prosecuted if they come forward with information about who was in their properties at the time of the deadly fire, the government has said.
Authorities have faced criticism from local residents who say the death toll is too low, with some claiming the true number is being held back for political reasons.
Relations between Grenfell residents and the authorities have been strained by suspicions about the death toll and anger about the pace at which people received official assistance and its quality when it did arrive.
Many residents from Barandon Walk, Testerton Walk and Hurstway have been living in temporary accommodation since the neighbourhoodâ€™s boiler, located beneath Grenfell Tower, was destroyed in the fire.
Meanwhile, a husband and wife who escaped the Grenfell Tower fire have revealed they lost their unborn child shortly after fleeing the building.
