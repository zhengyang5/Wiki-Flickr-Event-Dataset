The Conservative-run Westminster council is understood to be the latest town hall to have had a request for financial assistance pushed back by ministers.
However, the government appears determined not to fund or allow additional borrowing for any improvements that go beyond essential safety works.
Dany Cotton, commissioner of the LFB, has said retrofitting sprinklers in tower blocks “can’t be optional, it can’t be a nice-to-have”.
“Building owners are responsible for funding measures designed to make a building safe,” said a spokesman for the department.
“We’ve been clear that where a local authority has concerns about funding essential fire safety measures, they should contact DCLG as soon as possible to discuss their position.
