The government has today (30 August 2017) published the terms of reference for the independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety that was commissioned following the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy.
This Review will urgently assess the effectiveness of current building and fire safety regulations and related compliance and enforcement issues, with a focus on multi occupancy high rise residential buildings.
While the Review will cover the regulatory system for all buildings, it will have a specific focus on multi occupancy high rise residential buildings.
She will also engage with residents of multi occupancy residential buildings.
This independent Review led by Dame Judith Hackitt will address any potential failures and recommend how we ensure the whole building regulations and fire safety system is robust.
