Hero firefighters were captured on film battling the fierce flames at the Northern Quarter apartment block blaze.

Footage captured by witnesses on the ground shows firefighters stood just yards away from the flames on a balcony as the fire rages around them.

A GMFRS spokesman said the fire had spread to ‘multiple floors’ but the situation was ‘brought under control’ at the 12-storey building, believed to be the Lighthouse ApartHotel.

The M.E.N. understands that police officers worked with firefighters to evacuate residents immediately as the blaze was reported and the building was quickly cleared.

Initial investigations suggest the fire began on the ninth floor and spread to the eighth, tenth and eleventh floors before it was brought under control.

A number of sweeps of the building have taken place and the M.E.N. understands there are no reports of significant injuries.

Some residents are understood to have suffered minor smoke inhalation and are being treated, with one taken to hospital for treatment.
