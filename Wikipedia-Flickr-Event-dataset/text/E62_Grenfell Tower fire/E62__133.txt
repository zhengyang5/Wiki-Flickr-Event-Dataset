The management company in charge of Grenfell Tower has been stripped of responsibility for the estate it was housed on, Theresa May has revealed.

The Prime Minister attended a private meeting with residents of the west London tower block on Tuesday night to discuss concerns over the handling of the aftermath of the fire, which killed more than 80 people.

Mrs May, who faced criticism for initially failing to meet survivors and was booed during a later visit, told residents that Kensington and Chelsea Council "did not respond quickly enough after the fire", Downing Street said.

She confirmed that the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) would no longer manage the Lancaster Estate that is home to Grenfell Tower. They will continue to manage other properties for the council, it is understood.
