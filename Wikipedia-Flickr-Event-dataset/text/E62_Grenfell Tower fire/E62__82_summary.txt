"What I can tell you is there are 129 flats inside Grenfell Tower.
"At this stage, we must presume, that no-one in those 23 flats survived, that includes anyone who lived there or was visiting them."
Meanwhile, a number of Grenfell Tower residents confronted housing minister Alok Sharma MP on why the homeless are not yet rehoused, in tense exchanges on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
But Mahad Egal, who escaped the fourth floor of Grenfell Tower, told the programme he refused the offer of alternative accommodation in a high rise block for his family.
