The Government will send in a task force to take over parts of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.
Robert Black, the head of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (TMO), also stood down to “assist with the investigation and inquiry”.
“The immediate response to the disaster is being coordinated by the Grenfell Response Team, headed up by John Barradell.
The new team is expected to be phased in as the current Grenfell Tower response team is gradually wound down following the immediate aftermath of the fire.
Yvette Williams, coordinator of the Justice4Grenfell campaign group, said last week survivors were becoming increasingly angry over the council response to the tragedy.
