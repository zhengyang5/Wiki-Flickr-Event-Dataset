Numerous buildings across Israel are potentially as vulnerable as London’s Grenfell Tower — a residential high-rise where a June 14 fire killed at least 79 people, The Times of Israel has been told.
Israel’s Fire and Rescue Authority said there may be hundreds of buildings nationwide that are similarly vulnerable, but that it has no idea how many there are.
The polythene composite panels, found in both buildings, have been widely blamed for the rapid spread of the London fire.
There could be hundreds, he acknowledged uncomfortably, saying that under the current conditions certain buildings were “as vulnerable” as Grenfell Tower.
That is because in most of Israel, buildings experience more extreme temperatures in the summer, so the thermal insulation needs to be adapted to isolate buildings from the heat.
