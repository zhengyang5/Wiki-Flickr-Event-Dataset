An investigation said buildings built using the same method must be reinforced, or else have no gas supply.
Southwark council, which took over the Ledbury blocks from the former Greater London Council, said it believed they had been strengthened.
The gas supply was being turned off and locals would be moved out, the letter said.
“Not only is the gas supply illegal, but the structure of the building is potentially unsafe.
“As soon as I walked in and saw the gas supply, I knew it was all wrong,” he said.
