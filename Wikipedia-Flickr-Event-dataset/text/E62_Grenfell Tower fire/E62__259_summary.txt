Going from nine to 11 seats, the party are far from challenging Tory control – but Labour councillor Andrew Lomas, who won a seat from the Lib-Dems in Colville, feels the results are cause for celebration.
Andrew Barshall, Ian Henderson and celebrity hair stylist Heinz Schumi together amassed almost 1,400 votes – the largest ever percentage of votes taken from the Tories in a Chelsea ward election.
However, Mr Schumi considers the results to be a success.
