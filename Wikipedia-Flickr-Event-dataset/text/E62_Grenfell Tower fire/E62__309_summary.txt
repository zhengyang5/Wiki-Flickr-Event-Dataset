Cheap, flammable cladding is thought to have been instrumental in the fire’s rapid spread, prompting concern about its use in buildings across Australia.
On Friday, the South Australian government said it would audit buildings in Adelaide for dangerous cladding.
In 2015, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union wrote to state, territory and federal governments, urging them to audit buildings for flammable cladding.
“The biggest risk is cheap imported products, mostly from China,” de Brenni told Guardian Australia.
The opposition spokesman for innovation and industry, Kim Carr, said the government must explain what it is doing to prevent the use of flammable cladding products in Australia.
