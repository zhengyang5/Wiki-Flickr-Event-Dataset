A high ladder did not arrive at Grenfell Tower for more than 30 minutes, BBC Newsnight has learned.

An independent fire expert has said having the ladder, also known as an "aerial", available earlier would have given firefighters a better chance of stopping the blaze on 14 June getting out of control.

The London Fire Brigade says it has changed its procedures since the fire, and that a high ladder will now automatically be sent to a fire in a tower.

John Sweeney investigates.
