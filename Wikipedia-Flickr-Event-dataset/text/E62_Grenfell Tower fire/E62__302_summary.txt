The tests confirmed that a cladding system using aluminium composite material (ACM) panels with a polyethylene filler, and stone wool insulation “does not meet current building regulation guidance”.
Cladding samples from all 111 buildings had already failed the initial combustibility tests, also conducted by the Building Research Establishment (BRE).
Wall systems using both combinations that have failed the latest tests present “a significant fire hazard on buildings over 18 metres”, the DCLG warned.
It is believed that the overwhelming majority of these failed the latest two tests.
Around a third of the 111 buildings with the material that failed the most recent test are thought to be council-owned.
