The residents of Grenfell Tower were alarmed to discover smoke pouring from their electrical appliances in May 2013.
Time, and a public inquiry, will help establish whether a lax fire safety culture was operating at Grenfell Tower.
The Metropolitan police last night said that 58 people had either died in Grenfell Tower or were “missing, presumed dead”.
The tragedy has raised fears about safety at the rest of the UK’s 4,000 or so tower blocks and, in particular, the 87 that are clad with similar materials to Grenfell Tower.
Fire safety notices told Grenfell Tower residents to stay put.
