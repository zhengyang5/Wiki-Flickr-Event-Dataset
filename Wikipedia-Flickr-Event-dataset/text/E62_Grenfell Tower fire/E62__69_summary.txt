Updated Thursday 15 June at 5.05pmDr Vinod Diwakar Medical Director for NHS England (London) said:“Across London, we are continuing to respond to the tragic incident at the Grenfell tower block in Kensington.
A total of 74 patients are currently being treated in London hospitals.
64 of these patients were treated at the scene by ambulance crews and taken to hospital for further treatment.
Our priority is to continue to work closely with the NHS services involved.
We have tried and tested measures in place to manage this but we would also encourage Londoners to use NHS services wisely and seek advice from NHS 111 in the first instance.”Background information
