Six weeks on from the Manchester terror attack, NHS England has today sent an open letter to GPs across the country with practical advice to help patients who may be suffering ongoing mental health problems following this and other recent traumatic events.
Experts have said that it is around this point that people should be seeking help if they are still experiencing symptoms.
The open letter comes after the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London and the Grenfell tower block fire.
The letter describes how people with pre-existing mental illness may be destabilised by traumatic events.
Claire Murdoch, National Clinical Director for Mental Health said: â€œWe must remember that for those people who were affected by these horrific tragedies, the journey is not over and many will continue to face difficulties.
