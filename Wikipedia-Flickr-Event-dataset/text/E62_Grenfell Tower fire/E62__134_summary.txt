Councillors on Kensington and Chelsea Council unanimously voted to end the contract with Kensington & Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation.
Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said 20 families affected by the fire are now in permanent accommodation.
In August, it was stripped of its responsibility for the management of properties in the Lancaster West housing estate, including Grenfell Tower.
However, the council said it would now work with the TMO to bring its whole contract to an end.
