The Conservative council responsible for the tower block where at least 79 people died in a fire described by the mayor of London as preventable has stockpiled £274m of reserves and offered rebates to residents paying the top rate of council tax.
A draft statement of Kensington and Chelsea’s accounts for 2016-17 disclosed that the council has an “AA” credit rating and a financial standing described as robust, with “usable reserves at 31 March 2017 of £274m (£300m at 31 March 2016)”.
The rebate was paid weeks before local elections which returned a Conservative council, the author of the letter wrote.
In 2015, the council paid £5m from its reserves to help establish Opera Holland Park, formerly a department of the Kensington and Chelsea, as an independent charity.
The council’s reserves support a substantial programme of capital investment – including improvements to primary schools and a new library – details of which are on the council’s website,” he said.
