Prime Minister Theresa May has been criticised for not meeting the residents of Grenfell Tower when she visited the scene – in contrast to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London mayor Sadiq Khan.
In a message on Twitter, Ms Harman said: "Theresa May should have met Grenfell Fire residents.
Good Morning Britain's Piers Morgan tweeted: "If it's true Theresa May didn't meet ANY survivors or relatives of the dead on her #Grenfell visit today, that's an absolute disgrace."
If Theresa May doesn’t get how appalling not meeting the Grenfell residents looks/is, you’d think an adviser would point it out to her.
The Labour leader has called for empty luxury flats in Kensington to be used to house the Grenfell survivors.
