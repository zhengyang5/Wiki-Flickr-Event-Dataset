Meanwhile, the government has ordered immediate testing of the Hotpoint fridge-freezer that was involved in the Grenfell fire.
Every company involved in the building and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower will also be looked at as part of the investigation.
"Our priority is to understand who was in Grenfell Tower.
We are not interested in people's reasons for being in Grenfell Tower."
