There have also been dramatic tower fires linked to the aluminium panels with polyethylene core in the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and the United States.
Mark, 45, a witness to the Wednesday's London fire, said the Greenfell Tower had recently been renovated with cladding added to the outside.
It is understood the external cladding upgrade at London's Grenfell Tower was part of a recent Â£8.6million ($14.5 million) refurbishment.
Fire spread up the facade of the Lacrosse tower in a matter of minutes.
The combustible material is still in place at the Lacrosse building, and could stay there until July 2018, despite an order to remove it.
