Two original panel members of the government’s child abuse inquiry have said they were forced to fight attempts at political control and interference from the Home Office when it was run by Theresa May.
Sharon Evans and Graham Wilmer revealed how government officials intervened with the independent panel members by preparing a 23-page document instructing them how to answer questions from MPs.
It lists more than 50 “difficult questions” the panel members could expect, almost half about the inquiry’s public image rather than its actual work.

These included a principle of collective responsibility by which panel members could only make public statements about the inquiry if all their number agreed.
