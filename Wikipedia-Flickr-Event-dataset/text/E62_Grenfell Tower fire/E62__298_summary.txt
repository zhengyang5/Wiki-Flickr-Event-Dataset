A hospital trauma building is closing for a year due to concerns about fire safety following the Grenfell Tower tragedy.
The trauma unit at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford is to move from its current site "for up to 12 months" while improvements are made.
The unit, which houses 52 inpatient beds, needs urgent work to replace the cladding and address "a combination of fire safety factors".
External cladding is thought to have contributed to the spread of the fire at Grenfell Tower, which led to the deaths of at least 80 people.
Dr Bruno Holthof, chief executive of the hospital trust, said: "Our highest priority is the patients in our care and our staff who are dedicated in their care for those patients.
