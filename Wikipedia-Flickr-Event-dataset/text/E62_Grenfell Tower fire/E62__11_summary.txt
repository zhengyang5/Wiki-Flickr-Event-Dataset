Energy emitted from the cladding and insulation would have been equivalent to burning 51 tonnes of pinewood, University of Leeds research suggests.
The foam insulation underneath the cladding was, separately, thought to emit around 26 MJ/kg of heat.
He believes the air gap between the insulation and the external cladding panels on Grenfell Tower may have created a so-called "chimney effect", increasing the speed of the fire spreading.
Saint-Gobain, which manufacturers the Celotex RS5000 PIR, said it could not comment while there was an investigation into the circumstances around the Grenfell Tower fire.
