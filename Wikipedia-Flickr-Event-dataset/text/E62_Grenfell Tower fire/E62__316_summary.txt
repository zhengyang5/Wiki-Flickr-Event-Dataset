Met police says there are reasonable grounds to suspect council and tenant management organisation may have committed offenceThe Scotland Yard investigation into the Grenfell fire disaster has said there are “reasonable grounds” to suspect the council and the organisation that managed the tower block of corporate manslaughter.
But the punishment for corporate manslaughter is a fine.
“Also, one thing we have never seen in this country are individuals prosecuted under corporate manslaughter because it is always hard to find the controlling mind.
The current council leader, Elizabeth Campbell, said: “Our residents deserve answers about the Grenfell Tower fire and the police investigation will provide these.
Since then we have stated that it is a criminal investigation, considering the full range of offences from corporate manslaughter to regulatory breaches.
