Mosques, churches and temples are opening their doors to help people caught up in the huge fire in London.
Local people are rallying around to help the hundreds of people who live inside Grenfell Tower, the block that has been completely taken over by an inferno overnight.
But places of worship across North Kensington are throwing open their doors to offer people shelter, support and food.
Some were coming from as far as the other end of London and offering to give help in various ways.
Muslims were said to be among the first to respond to the fire, since they were already awake from Ramadan prayers.
