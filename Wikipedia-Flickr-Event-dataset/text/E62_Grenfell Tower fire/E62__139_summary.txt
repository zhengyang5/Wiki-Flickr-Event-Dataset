Media reports in the UK now suggest that the tragic fire in the Grenfell Tower apartment building in London’s Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, could lead to an insurance industry loss of as much as £1 billion.
The Times newspaper first reported that the Grenfell Tower fire could cost anywhere from £200 million to £1 billion, depending on the extent and cost of any litigation, the number of deaths, re-housing and rehabilitation costs, demolition and rebuilding costs, and also whether any other tower blocks have to be improved or evacuated.
It’s now clear from the UK government that as many as 600 high rise buildings feature similar cladding to the one used on Grenfell Tower, with three samples showing it to be combustible.
That could escalate the ultimate industry loss significantly, making the $1 billion mooted seem more reasonable perhaps even surpassable.
Media reports suggest that the Grenfell Tower fire could result in the largest ever insurance claim for a building fire, which would mean a significant hit to exposed reinsurance firms.
