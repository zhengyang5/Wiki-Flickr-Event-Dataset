LONDON (Reuters) - The manufacturer of the panels used to clad the London tower block where at least 30 people died in a fire this week advised customers against using its polyethylene-cored tiles — the ones reportedly used at Grenfell Tower — in high rise buildings.
REUTERS/Hannah McKayDiagrams in a brochure dated 2016 for Reynobond tiles reviewed by Reuters show how polyethylene (PE) core tiles are suitable only for buildings of up to 10 metres in height.
Construction company Rydon Group, which undertook the work, and the local authority which owns Grenfell Tower declined to confirm whether the panels were PE.
The newspaper said the PE panels were 2 pounds ($2.56) cheaper per square metre than the Reynobond FR option.
Reuters has not been able to confirm independently whether the PE panels were ultimately used or whether the use of PE-core panels is legal in Britain.
