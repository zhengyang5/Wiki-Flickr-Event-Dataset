This is roughly the reduction in the money English local authorities get from central government, since 2010.
Overall, their budgets are 26% lower, because they also raise money locally.
“Local authorities… have had their budgets cut by 40% [since 2010].” Jeremy Corbyn, 28 June 2017Local councils in England have seen an average cut to their budgets of almost 26% since 2010, taking inflation into account, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
The final reduction is 26% because they also raise money locally, which didn’t fall by as much.
Again, this figure only covers the money from central government, including some funding from changes to the rules on local business rates.
