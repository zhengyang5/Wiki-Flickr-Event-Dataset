Rydon lands Grenfell Tower refurbishmentJuly 2016Rydon has completed the refurbishment to Grenfell Tower for Kensington & Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), upgrading the 24-storey 1970s building as part of a £67m borough-wide regeneration.
All of the remodelling & refurbishment works were completed with residents still in occupation on the upper twenty floors.
Dale Youth Boxing Club, which has produced some of the UK’s best boxing talent including Olympic Gold medallist James DeGale and former European, British and Commonwealth super-middleweight champion George Groves, is based within Grenfell Tower.
Grenfell Nursery was relocated to a larger and more convenient space on the ground floor next to a new outside play area.
The works achieved a BREEAM Good rating and Rydon helped the client secure eco funding grants.
