Image copyright AFP Image caption At least 80 people died at Grenfell TowerLondon's fire commissioner says the Grenfell Tower blaze must be a "turning point", calling for sprinklers in all high-rise council flats.
"If that isn't one of the recommendations (of the Grenfell Tower inquiry) then I will be so very disappointed."
This requirement was not applied retroactively so did not apply to Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974.
"The Grenfell public inquiry must report as soon as possible so that action can be taken."
We will consider this issue in light of the recommendations of this review and the findings of the Public Inquiry."
