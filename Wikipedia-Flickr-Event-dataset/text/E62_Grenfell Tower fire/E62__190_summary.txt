The design of Grenfell Tower might have helped the deadly fire that ripped through it spread, according to experts.
The building was covered in cladding that spread the fire quickly up the entire 24-storey building, according to architects and firefighters.
Residents agreed that the material on the outside of the building appeared to be allowing it to spread up the outside.
Paul Mennacer, who lived on the seventh floor of Grenfell Tower, said: "I got woken up by people screaming, saying 'Don't jump'.
"If spread of fire does occur, as has happened at Grenfell Tower, the consequences are often catastrophic."
