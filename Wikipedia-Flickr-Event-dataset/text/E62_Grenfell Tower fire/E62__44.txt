A resident of Grenfell Tower has described seeing the ‘small’ kitchen fire – that would later spread and destroy the entire building.

Maryam Adam, a 41-year-old pregnant woman, lived next door to Flat 16 – where the blaze started in the early hours of the morning.

She said that her neighbour woke her and others up after packing some of his bags, and they were all ushered out into the street before the flames engulfed the block.

‘That means he took the stuff from his flat, and then he told the neighbours,’ she said.

Speaking outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after a precautionary check up, Maryam described the moment her neighbour woke her up to tell her there was a fire.

‘The fire started in the flat next door to mine on the fourth floor,’ she said.

‘It was when he [the neighbour] knocked on the door that he said there was a fire in his flat. It was exactly 12.50am because I was sleeping and it woke me up.

‘When we got up, I saw outside his flat his luggage. There was a big bag with his clothes. That means he took the stuff from his flat, and then he told the neighbours.

‘The fire was small in the kitchen. I could see it because the flat door was open. And then we passed and then we were out.’

Maryam also said that even though firefighters had arrived, the building’s alarm still hadn’t gone off.

‘When we were outside there were two fire engines,’ she said. ‘There was no alarm. Until 1.30am there were very few people coming out of the building. The fire was spreading up.’

The devastating fire has killed at least 12 people, and left hundreds homeless.

Maryam added: ‘If he had not knocked on my door then I don’t know what would have happened.’
