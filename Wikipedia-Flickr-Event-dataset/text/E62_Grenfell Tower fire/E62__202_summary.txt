Arconic said it was discontinuing sales of Reynobond PE for tower blocks due to "issues" identified by the fire, which is feared to have killed at least 79.
He said the fact all tested samples had failed the so-called combustibility test underlined the "vital importance of submitting samples urgently".
Questions about the cladding used on Grenfell Tower, in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, were raised in the days after the fire.
Some 103 households are currently refusing to leave the tower blocks, the BBC understands - an increase on Saturday when 83 households remained.
