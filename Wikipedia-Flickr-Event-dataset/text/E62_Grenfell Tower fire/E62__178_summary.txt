At least 79 people died and many more were left homeless after fire engulfed the North Kensington tower a week ago.
There has been widespread anger from Grenfell Tower residents at the slow and chaotic response from authorities after last Wednesday's devastating blaze.
It said the "expectation was that these new properties would be offered as one of the options to permanently rehouse residents from Grenfell Tower".
Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Grenfell residents had been through "some of the most harrowing and traumatic experiences imaginable".
