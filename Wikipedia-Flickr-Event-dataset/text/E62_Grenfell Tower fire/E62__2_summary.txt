Meanwhile, eight-year-old Mehdi El-Wahabi is the latest victim of the 14 June blaze to be named.
Police said CCTV footage from the foyer of Grenfell Tower "clearly" showed around 240 people escaped the 24-story block, which contained 129 flats.
Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner said the investigation would deal with "whatever offences come to light".
The 24-hour security at Grenfell Tower has since been reviewed and changes have been "immediately put into place".
