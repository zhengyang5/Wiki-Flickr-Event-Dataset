A ferocious blaze in the Lacrosse Tower in 2014 was blamed on illegal imported decorative cladding.
Mr Xenophon has called for all Australian buildings faced with cladding to be inspected in the wake of the London tragedy.
Matthew Needham-Laing, an architect at Katten Law UK, said that cladding fires had occurred since 1991.
The Grenfell Tower was managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) on behalf of the local London borough council.
The Grenfell Tower is located close to some of the most ritzy districts in London.
