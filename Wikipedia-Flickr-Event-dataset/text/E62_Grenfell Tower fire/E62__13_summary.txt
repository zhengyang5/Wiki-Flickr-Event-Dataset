This independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety is being led by Dame Judith Hackitt.
The Review will urgently assess the effectiveness of current building and fire safety regulations and related compliance and enforcement issues, with a focus on multi occupancy high rise residential buildings.
While the Review will cover the regulatory system for all buildings, it will have a specific focus on multi occupancy high rise residential buildings.
The Review will report jointly to Communities Secretary Sajid Javid and Home Secretary Amber Rudd.
An interim report will be submitted in autumn 2017 and a final report submitted in spring 2018.
