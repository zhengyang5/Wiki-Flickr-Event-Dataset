A FAMILY who miraculously survived the Grenfell Tower blaze have revealed their heartbreak at losing their unborn son to poisonous fumes, hours after escaping the fire.
Marcio Gomes and Andreia Perestrelo survived the deadly fire after climbing down from the 21st floor with their two daughters, Megan, 10 and Luana, 12.
Mr Gomes has since revealed he was told later that night the “baby’s heart had stopped and the priority is the mother”.
“My wife gave birth that night while she was in an induced coma, so she didn’t know at the time.
The next day she was she was very happy to see the baby, she didn’t want the baby to go away,” he said.
