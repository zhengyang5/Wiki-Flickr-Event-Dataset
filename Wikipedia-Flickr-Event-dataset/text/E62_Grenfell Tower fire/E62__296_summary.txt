Tower blocks around the country could be fitted with the insulation that fuelled the Grenfell inferno but it is not being tested by the Government, it has emerged.
Councils and landlords have been told to carry out their own examination of the potentially combustible material behind the panels, despite police testing highlighting the speed at which it burned on the west London tower block.
The Government, which is rushing through official tests on the cladding panel, has been accused of looking for a "quick fix".
Police have now formally identified 18 victims of the Grenfell fire, with a further 61 people missing presumed dead.
It is feared that the number could yet rise.
