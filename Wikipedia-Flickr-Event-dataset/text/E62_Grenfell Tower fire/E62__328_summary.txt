The Metropolitan Police Commissioner has suggested that the hire of vans may have to be regulated to prevent them being used in a terrorist attack.
Cressida Dick said new laws may be be required to control the ability of people to hire vans at short notice in order to weed out potential attackers, such as the man alleged to have mowed down Muslim worshipers in Finsbury Park and the London Bridge terror gang.
She told the London Assembly on Wednesday that the police are currently reliant on information from van hire firms to monitor who is trying get hold of a vehicle for sinister purposes.
Ms Dick said: “How can you, it’s very hard, but how can you deal with van hire?
It might require some tweaking of legislation,” she told the assembly’s Police and Crime Committee.
