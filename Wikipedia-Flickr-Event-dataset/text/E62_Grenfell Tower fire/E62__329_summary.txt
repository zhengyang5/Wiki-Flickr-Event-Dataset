Around 80 police officers and firefighters are seeking help for post-traumatic stress every day and two have taken their own lives, as they struggle to cope with events such as the recent terror attacks and the Grenfell fire, new figures have revealed.
A charity set up last year to help emergency workers deal with psychological problems said its helpline had been inundated in the wake of recent events.
PTSD999 said at least two officers who had requested help from the charity had since committed suicide.
The organisation also warned that its research suggested almost a fifth of all serving police officers could be suffering from mental trauma caused by events they had experienced at work.
