The Queen looked teary-eyed while visiting the Grenfell Tower fire victims, rescuers and volunteers in west London to hear first hand accounts of the tragedy.

Accompanied by the Duke of Cambridge she arrived shortly before 11am at a rest centre helping those directly affected by the blaze - and looked visibly moved by what she saw.

In tense, emotional scenes, William promised one distraught resident whose friends' children are missing: "I'll be back."

The man had been shouting: "What about the children? Queen? Queen? What about the children?".

It has emerged he was waving a poster featuring children from the Hashim family missing in the blaze reported on by MirrorOnline last night.

The site is only yards from the charred remains of the building in west London - and is one of the locations where people have been making donations.

Both the Queen and Prince William were met with applause for their decision to visit the victims at the Westway Sports Centre in White City.

The 91-year-old monarch's visit is in stark contrast to that of the PM Theresa May's behind closed doors yesterday - which Downing Street said was necessary because of "security concerns".

The Prime Minister has been roundly criticised for not meeting victims of the fire face-to-face on her visit.

Yesterday the Queen paid tribute to the "bravery" of firefighters who battled the fire and praised the "incredible generosity" of volunteers offering their support.

Today she met them face-to-face.

Charity worker Taksima Ferdous, 31, who is from east London, said The Queen told her: "You have been incredible, please keep continuing" - while Prince William shook her hand to say thank you.

Afterwards the man said he was distressed because his friends children are still missing.

He slammed the authorities for the way they have handled the situation.

MailOnline reports that the man who Prince William replied to had been shouting: "What about the children? Queen? Queen? What about the children?".

It also reports that "the man doing the shouting was holding up pics of his best friendâ€™s family".

They are understood to be parents Nora and Hashim, their son Yahya and daughter Firdaws, who MirrorOnline reported last night were in the tower when the fire started - and are now missing.

Meanwhile, Downing Street this morning said that Mrs May was making a private visit today to speak with survivors at one of the London hospitals where they are being treated.

Following the visit, the Prime Minister will chair a cross-Whitehall meeting on how the authorities can help affected communities and victims recover, Downing Street announced.
