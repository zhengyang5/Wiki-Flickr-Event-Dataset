The blaze spread at a terrifying rate, with the flames starting on one side of the 27-storey Grenfell Tower before moving round the building.

In a matter of minutes what were once people's homes were little more than a charred wreck as the building was gutted by fire.

Jody Martin said he got to the scene just as the first fire engine was arriving at Grenfell Tower, in Latimer Road.

He told the BBC: "I grabbed an axe from the fire truck, it looked like there was a bit of confusion about what to do.

"I ran around the building looking for a fire escape and couldn't see any noticeable fire escapes around the building. A lot of debris falling down.
