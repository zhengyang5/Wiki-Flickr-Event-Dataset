More than £40,000 has already been spent hiring a fire engine to be on standby outside a block of flats which is covered in unsafe cladding.
Slough Borough Council is paying around £2,000 per day for firefighters to watch over the privately owned Nova House in Berkshire.
The cladding on the outside failed government safety tests introduced after the Grenfell Tower disaster.
While the cladding failed tests, the insulation beneath it is made of rockwool, which is accepted as having good fire resistant qualities.
Councillors have denied that it is unsafe for residents to stay in the flats, saying they are working on the advice of fire experts.
