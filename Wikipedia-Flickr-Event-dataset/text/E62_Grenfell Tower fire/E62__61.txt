Dozens of residents, some tearful and distraught, have come to Latymer community church, which is providing shelter and support for affected residents and their families.



Positioned just north-west of Grenfell Tower, volunteers have arrived at the church in droves to help.

As the Guardian arrived, a man collapsed in his chair in tears before becoming faint and needing medical assistance. A doctor rushed to help and a wheelchair was provided to take him into the church.

On the doorstep was Tim Burke, a North Kensington resident who runs a community arts project. He rushed down in the early hours to help. Describing the scenes inside the church and gesturing towards the man who fainted, he said: “Everywhere you look, it looks like this.”

He estimated about 60 people were inside being helped. “This is a close, mixed community,” he said. “We desperately need financial support to help people who have lost everything.”

Carol, who lives nearby and volunteered to hand out masks and water, said: “People have just lost everything they own. Their lives have been ripped apart. Who’s going to help them? Who is going to rebuild that.”

Carol said she would do what she could to help. “These are my people, this is my community and I care about my community.”

About 200 metres away, the burning shell of the tower continued to billow smoke. Fist-sized chunks of blackened debris was spread across the road. The Rev Steve Divall, from nearby St Helen’s church, prayed with some residents in the street outside Latymer community church.

“The community response is very moving,” he said. “People are just trying to do everything to help their neighbours. There’s food being brought, clothing being brought.” As he spoke, two cars pulled up and people started to unload drinks, food and blankets from the boots and carried them into the community centre.
