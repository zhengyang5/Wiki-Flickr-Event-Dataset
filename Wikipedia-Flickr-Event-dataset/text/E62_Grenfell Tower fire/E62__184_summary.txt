Just 26 of 203 Grenfell families are living in permanent homes (Picture; Rick Findler/PA Wire)Most families who lost their homes in the Grenfell Tower have still not been rehomed, the Government has admitted.
Housing minister Alok Sharma, 50, said that by the end of October just 26 of the 203 households who had lived in the tower and on Grenfell Walk now had permanent accommodation.
He said: ‘Five months on from the Grenfell Tower fire we are seeing an abject failure by the state to support the survivors of this tragedy.
Instead, Mr Sharma said more families are set to move into permanent homes as 61 have accepted offers of new accommodations.
In June, Theresa May pledged to rehouse the Grenfell Tower victims in three weeks as she launched a £5million fund to help them.
