What Sparked TVCC?
Heat transfer alone may have set fire to the building, said another architect who took part in the design of the TVCC.
The reinforcing bars that cover the TVCC are metal and could have become superheated from the nearby explosions.
Once the fire caught, the hollow core between the fifth and twenty-sixth floors of the TVCC may have accelerated the burn.
The Beijing Municipal Fire Bureau also confirmed that the TVCCâ€™s hollow core collapsed in the fire.
