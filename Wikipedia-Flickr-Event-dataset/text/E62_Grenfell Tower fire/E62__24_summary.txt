The contract to carry out the Grenfell Tower refurbishment project was won by Rydon and completed in June 2016.
A report from July 2013 gave an update on the improvement work proposed at Grenfell Tower.
Grenfell Tower was built in 1974.
The refurbishment project was, in theory, an opportunity to retrofit the building with a sprinkler system but it wasn't taken.
Sprinklers were not fitted as part of the refurbishment inside Grenfell Tower.
