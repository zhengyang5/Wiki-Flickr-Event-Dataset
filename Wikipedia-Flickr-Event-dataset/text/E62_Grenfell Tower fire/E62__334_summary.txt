“It is vital that the voice of Grenfell residents and victims’ families are heard throughout the process and that they have full confidence,” he said.
He called for a “two-part inquiry, with the first part looking at the specific issues around Grenfell and reporting back quickly, and the second part looking at the national issues”.
“The inquiry has got to look at how [the regulatory] regime developed, or I think the residents would feel they were let down.

“He will be consulting them further, together with other interested parties, on the terms of reference for the inquiry.
