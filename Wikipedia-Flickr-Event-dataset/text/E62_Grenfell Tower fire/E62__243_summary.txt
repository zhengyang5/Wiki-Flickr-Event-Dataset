Corbyn enraged Tory MPs by linking the deaths to Tory spending cuts since 2010 but his criticism was actually quite specific.
Fire service cutsCorbyn is right to say that since 2010 fire safety audits and inspections were cut by a quarter as fire authority budgets were cut.
In London, audits fell from 14,091 in 2009-10 to 13,709 in 2015-16, while safety audits on blocks of four storeys or more rose from 1,307 to 2,507.
The Lakanal House coroner recommended the government encourage all local councils to consider retrofitting sprinkler systems in their tower blocks.
The building regulations have yet to be updated in these ways.
