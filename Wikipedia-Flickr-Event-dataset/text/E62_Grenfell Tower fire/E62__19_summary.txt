A structural engineer is monitoring the stability of Grenfell Tower, amid fears the 24-storey highrise in west London could collapse after being ravaged by fire.
Built in 1974, there are 120 homes in the block, made up of one- and two-bedroom flats.
Up to 600 people are believed to have been inside the building in north Kensington when the blaze broke out shortly before 1am.
