Ms Jones said UK ministers, who do not have jurisdiction over housing regulations in Wales, had strongly opposed the assembly legislation.
Thirty people are now known to have died and many more are missing after Wednesday morning's Grenfell Tower fire.
Wales has the tightest regulations on sprinklers in the UK - they must be installed in all new builds and refurbishments.
