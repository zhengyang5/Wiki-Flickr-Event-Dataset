The death toll from Grenfell Tower may fall because some of those missing have been invented by fraudsters, the police have revealed.

There are eight people who have either been charged or are under investigation for fraud in relation to the inferno which ripped through the west London fire block.

Whilst some of those claim to have lost their homes to "get benefit" others have claimed to have lost loved ones, police confirmed.

Commander Stuart Cundy said that 60 individuals have now been formally identified as losing their lives in the inferno on June 14 and whilst finger tip searches remain ongoing they expect the death toll to fall slightly from their original estimation of 80.
