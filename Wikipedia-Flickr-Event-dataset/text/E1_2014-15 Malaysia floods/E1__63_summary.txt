Kit Siang fumes over a report about Najib playing golf with Obama as floods ravage the East Coast.
GELANG PATAH: DAP has urged Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak to cut short his holiday in Hawaii and declare a state of emergency as severe floods continue to ravage the East Coast.
He also criticised Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin for his response to mounting criticism of Najib for his absence from the country.
“Malaysian have reason to worry that Muhyiddin is up to the task of handling the nation’s worst floods since 1971, with his stubborn refusal to agree to the need to declare an emergency to focus all Federal Government resources to deal with the devastation,” he said.
“Najib should not dilly-dally but declare an emergency because of the floods and cut short his Hawaii holiday to rush back to take charge.”
