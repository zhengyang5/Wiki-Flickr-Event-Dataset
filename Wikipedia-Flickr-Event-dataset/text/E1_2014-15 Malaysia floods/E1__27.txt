Star Online also reported that the airport toilets had been used by travellers to take showers and all ATM machines were not functioning.

Economics student Siow Lean Hin, 21, told Star Online they reached the airport early to ensure that they did not miss their flights.

“We heard some of the flights were postponed. We just want to go home. We took the chance to come early and slept on the floor,” he said.
