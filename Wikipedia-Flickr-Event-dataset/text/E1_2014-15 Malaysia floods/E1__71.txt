PORT DICKSON: A rowdy village head of Kampung Jimah in Lukut started shouting abuses at a group of PKR leaders, demanding they “get out” of “his” village despite the group being there only to deliver aid to a flood victim’s family.

Captured on video and now uploaded on YouTube, the video showed Shafie Alwi demanding the group leave as they had entered the village without asking his permission.

Saying, “Come on, this is my village, you know”, Shafie Alwi refused to let up even though PKR Port Dickson State Assemblyman, M Ravi said he had a right to be there as Shafie did not have the authority to stop people from entering the village.

Repeating many times over “This is my village. I have a right”, Shafie also said, “Don’t do the bullshit. Hey, this is my area, I’ll call my men to scold you.”

He also accused the PKR group of “ambushing” the village and warned he would call the police, a threat Ravi and members of his group said he was more than welcome to.

With raised voices and mounting tension, the heated argument took a political turn when Shafie started accusing the PKR group of offering aid only because they wanted to politicise the flooding mishap.

Ravi said Shafie had done nothing to help the people in his village who have lived with recurrent flooding of their houses for over 10 years.

Meanwhile Shafie told Sinar Harian, that all he was doing was protecting his villagers from intruders.

He also belittled the aid brought by the PKR group, saying it was nothing that would make the villager rich.

Shafie also had an issue with that particular family as according to him, “That family has received aid on many occasions.”
