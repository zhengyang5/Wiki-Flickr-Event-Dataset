By Ika Koeck, IFRCIn December 2014, the seasonal flooding in Malaysia has forced more than 200,000 people from their homes and left at least 10 people dead, making it the countryâ€™s worst flooding in decades.
A majority of houses and buildings in the affected states remain submerged, forcing thousands to remain in evacuation and relief centres.
MRCS has also launched a national campaign for the floods operation called Ops Banjir BSMM Prihatin to facilitate donations.
To aid in the relief efforts, the Red Cross Society of China made a contribution of USD 100,000 while Singapore Red Cross contributed approximately USD 170,000.
Meanwhile a contingency plan placing MRCS branches in non-affected areas on standby have been activated by the national headquarters.
