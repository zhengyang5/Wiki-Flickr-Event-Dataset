KOTA BARU: The Sultan of Kelantan, Sultan Muhammad V has called on the people to be more environmentally friendly as human wrongdoings could have contributed to the flood situation.
"Let us extend a hand of friendship with the environment and let us be aware that all disaster problems that have occurred are the result of our own doings.
"May Allah forgive us all and turn this plight into a much better situation," Sultan Muhammad said this in a text distributed to the media here on Saturday.
The clinic's medical and health officer Dr Yap Yang Seng said the food supply, which included rice, sugar and biscuits, were sent by a helicopter of the Malaysian Armed Forces.
The Government is relying on air support and boats to dispatch aid to flood victims as roads were not passable.
