Authorities in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and Songhla provinces are gathering donations and volunteers to help rehabilitate the badly flood-damaged neighbouring state of Kelantan in Malaysia.
The floods in Kelantan had yet to completely disappear and people in the southern Thai provinces were lending a helping neighbourly hand, Lt Gen Prakan said.
He planned to deliver the first donations to Kelantan on Jan 17 and 18.
Panu Uthairat, secretary-general of the Southern Border Provinces Administrative Centre, said the biggest need was for drinking water.
Pol Maj Gen Songkiat Wathakul, deputy commissioner of the Southern Border Provinces Police, said police in the border provinces were also gathering donations and would forward them to provincial halls in the region.
