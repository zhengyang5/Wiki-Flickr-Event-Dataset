KOTA BARU: Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak on Saturday explained that his golf game with United States president Barack Obama in Hawaii recently did not mean that he deliberately ignored the flood faced by the country as politicised by certain groups.
On the contrary, the Prime Minister said the game had been planned much earlier on the principle of establishing diplomatic ties with world leaders for Malaysia's benefit.
"And playing golf is not something strange or extraordinary...because during the times of Tun Abdul Razak (Malaysia's second prime minister), Tun Dr Ismail Abdul Rahman (second deputy prime minister), playing golf with world leaders could be described as golf diplomacy," he said.
"And (I) made the immediate visit to demonstrate that the Government is very committed to continue to assist the flood victims," he added.
The flood situation in Kelantan is now becoming more serious when tens of thousands of residents had to seek shelter at temporary relief centres.
