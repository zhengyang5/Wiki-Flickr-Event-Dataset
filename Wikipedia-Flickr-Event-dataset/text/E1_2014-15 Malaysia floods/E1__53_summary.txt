Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Dec. 30 (CNA) A team of 31 medical workers and volunteers put together by a Taiwanese search and rescue organization and the Buddha's Light International Association entered flood-hit areas in Malaysia on Tuesday to offer relief services to victims.
The Taiwanese rescue team was joined by members of local youth organizations, bringing the total number of people on the mission to more than 50, before setting off for the affected states in the eastern part of peninsular Malaysia.
They had with them 12 vehicles loaded with supplies and rescue equipment, and they expected to remain in the affected areas for six days, according to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Malaysia.
In the worst flooding seen in Malaysia in three decades, nine states, including Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis were inundated by floods caused by monsoon rains.
The floods have forced the evacuation of more than 230,000 people, and the number was still rising, Taiwan's representative office said.
