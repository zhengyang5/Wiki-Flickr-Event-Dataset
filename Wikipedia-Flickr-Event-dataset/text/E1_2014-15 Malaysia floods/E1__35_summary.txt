Officials in Sungai Kolok district said yesterday that flooding has devastated much of northern Malaysia, particularly in Kelantan.
Areas by the Sungai Kolok River in Tak Bai and Sungai Kolok districts remained under water yesterday following floods that started on Dec 17.
At least six petrol stations in Sungai Kolok district were closed temporarily as locals and Malaysian people queued up to buy petrol, causing the stations to run out of supplies.
In Yala, water levels in the Pattani River increased 4-5 centimetres after authorities started releasing water from Bang Lang dam on Friday.
According to the weather warning, rain is expected in Phatthalung, Songkhla, Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat.
