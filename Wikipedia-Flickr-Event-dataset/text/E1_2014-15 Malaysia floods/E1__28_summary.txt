The vice-chancellor says the students should return quick so they do not miss their examinations scheduled for next week.
GEORGE TOWN: Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) wants its students, who went home to Kelantan, to return to their respective campuses sooner to avoid being trapped by the floods.
With Kelantan currently being the worst hit by the flood situation, USM had taken the initiative to mobilise its machinery to help flood victims there.
The USM Hospital in Kelantan has been operating a flood operations room since December 18, deploying relief workers and a medical team on a three-shift basis.
