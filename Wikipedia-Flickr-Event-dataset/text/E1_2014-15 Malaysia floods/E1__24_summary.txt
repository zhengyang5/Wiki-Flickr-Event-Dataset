KUALA KRAI, Dec 29, 2014:Amid rising floods, the Kuala Krai Hospital (HKK) is doubling up as a relief centre for residents seeking shelter.
“For the first time, HKK has become a shelter for flood victims, although it is not our responsibility.
At 1am, the flood waters rose and we ran to my mother’s shop in town.
Kuala Krai town, which had been under flood waters as high as a two-storey building, is gradually recovering, as the waters subside.
The flood water level, prior to this, almost touched the roof of the Kuala Krai Main Market.
