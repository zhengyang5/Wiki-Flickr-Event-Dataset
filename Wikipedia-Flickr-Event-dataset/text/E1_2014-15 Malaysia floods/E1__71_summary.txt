The group was there to deliver aid to a flood victim’s family when Shafie Alwi shouted at them, saying they had entered “his” village.
VIDEO INSIDEPORT DICKSON: A rowdy village head of Kampung Jimah in Lukut started shouting abuses at a group of PKR leaders, demanding they “get out” of “his” village despite the group being there only to deliver aid to a flood victim’s family.
Captured on video and now uploaded on YouTube, the video showed Shafie Alwi demanding the group leave as they had entered the village without asking his permission.
With raised voices and mounting tension, the heated argument took a political turn when Shafie started accusing the PKR group of offering aid only because they wanted to politicise the flooding mishap.
He also belittled the aid brought by the PKR group, saying it was nothing that would make the villager rich.
