Reports of severe floods in Kajang appeared over social media, with pictures showing water levels knee-deep in various parts of Kajang town.
According to Hulu Langat MCA Youth chief Pung Wai Hung, the flood started at around 3pm, with about half of Kajang town submerged in flood waters.
Lim said this was the third time this year Kajang suffered from severe floods.
The water levels were so high that I even saw some cars floating on the street.
A post on Kajang rep Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail's Facebook page said heavy rain caused the Kantan River to overflow.
