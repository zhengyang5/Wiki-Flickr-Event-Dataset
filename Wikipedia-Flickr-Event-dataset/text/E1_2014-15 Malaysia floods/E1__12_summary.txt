KUALA TERENGGANU: Medical supplies salesman CW Chan, 25, had to survive on one meal of rice a day after he was stranded in Kuala Kerai, Kelantan, for five days due to the the unprecedented floods afflicting the east coast.
He said they had to resort to collecting rain water to cook as potable water had already run out by the fourth day he was there.
He said he slept in his car at night and charged his phone using his car charger as there was no electricity in the area.
"It was really difficult, I just wanted to go home," he told theSun when contacted today.
Choot said the Chambers sympathise with the plight of the flood victims and wanted to do their part in assisting them.
