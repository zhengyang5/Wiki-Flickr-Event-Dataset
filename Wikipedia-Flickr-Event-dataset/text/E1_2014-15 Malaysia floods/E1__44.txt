The Johor Football Association has officially announced its contribution of RM100,000 to assist the growing number of flood victims at the East Coast of Malaysia.

States like Terengganu and Kelantan has been massively hit with torrential rain and flash floods in recent days, as the monsoon season continues to plague the region, though Johor FA’s contribution is likely to aid them significantly.

“Johor FA will be providing a total of RM100,000 for all the flood victims at the East Coast states of Malaysia and the donation will be passed on to relevant bodies who are actively involved in the search and rescue efforts,” the Southern Tigers said via their official Facebook page.

“We would also like to represent all players, staff and management in sharing our sympathy towards the plight of all victims of this unprecedented tragedy.”

As of this morning, over 90,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in both states, and what’s worse is that the floods are showing no signs of receding
