― Bernama picKUALA LUMPUR, Dec 25 — An anaesthesiologist has had to intubate a baby in the dark to save the child's life after the generator ran out of fuel at Kuala Krai Hospital, today.
This was the harrowing account as described through a WhatsApp message by Dr Adibah Abdullah, a medical officer at the hospital.
"Kuala Krai has become a huge river, and our hospital is one of the few islands, which unfortunately does not glow in the dark," she wrote.
Dr Adibah noted that the patients were devastated when they saw the amphibious vehicle leave, unable to reach them.
