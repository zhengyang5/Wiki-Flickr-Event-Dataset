The vice-chancellor says the students should return quick so they do not miss their examinations scheduled for next week.

GEORGE TOWN: Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) wants its students, who went home to Kelantan, to return to their respective campuses sooner to avoid being trapped by the floods.

In a statement, Vice-chancellor Omar Osman said, “My advice is they should take necessary precautionary steps to avoid being hindered by floods.

“If possible, they should return to their campuses immediately to prepare for their examinations.”

He also urged the students to immediately contact USM’s hostel officials, students’ affairs and development unit, schools or the director’s office of respective campuses for engineering and health in Kelantan if they faced difficulties because of the floods when returning to campuses in time for their examinations.

Omar gave his assurances that USM would monitor the situation at all times by disseminating information among all campuses in Minden on Penang island, Nibong Tebal on the Seberang Perai mainland and Kubang Kerian in Kelantan.

With Kelantan currently being the worst hit by the flood situation, USM had taken the initiative to mobilise its machinery to help flood victims there.

The USM Hospital in Kelantan has been operating a flood operations room since December 18, deploying relief workers and a medical team on a three-shift basis.

The hospital also set up five rooms comprising 16 beds to cater to flood victims in need of medical treatment while 100 USM students have joined as voluntary flood relief workers to help in the catastrophe that has hit the state.
