KUALA LUMPUR: The Japanese government has offered additional emergency assistance worth RM300,000 to ease the hardship of Malaysians affected by the recent floods.
The Japanese Embassy in Malaysia in a statement on Friday said it had offered items including tents, blankets and other humanitarian goods as response to the request for assistance from the Malaysian government.
It said on Jan 1, the Japanese government had provided emergency relief goods worth over RM500,000 in the form of items such as generators, water purifiers and other humanitarian goods to the flood victims.
"The government of Japan always stands ready to assist Malaysia in such tragic circumstances and earnestly hopes that the Malaysian government and the people will continue to face adversity with courage, and to bring back stable life to people in those areas as soon as possible," it said.
Eight states were hit by massive floods beginning in the middle of last month with Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang among the hardest hit states with more than 200,000 people evacuated at the height of the disaster.
