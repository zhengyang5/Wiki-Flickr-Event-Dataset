BEIJING, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Two IL-76 air transport aircraft loaded with relief goods set out for Kuala Lumpur Monday morning, according to China's Ministry of National Defense.
The People's Liberation Army immediately prepared relief goods including tents, generators, sewage pumps and water purifying equipment after the Malaysian defense ministry sent its request.
Malaysia has suffered its worst flood in past 45 years since the end of 2014, with over 200,000 people evacuated from their homes.
The Chinese government also decided on Saturday to offer humanitarian aids worth 20 million yuan (3.26 million U.S. dollars) to Malaysia and Sri Lanka respectively for flood relief.
The aids were for the purpose of the relief of the flood victims and the first batch of 2,500 tents will soon be sent to Kuala Lumpur by air, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
