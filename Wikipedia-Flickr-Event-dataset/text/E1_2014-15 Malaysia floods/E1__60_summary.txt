Najib, who was pictured playing golf with President Obama in Hawaii on Wednesday, faced criticism over the timing of his vacation.
More than 105,000 people have sought shelter in schools, community halls and other relief centers, according to flood monitoring centers.
It surpasses the previous record of 100,000 people evacuated during floods in 2008, Reuters reported.
