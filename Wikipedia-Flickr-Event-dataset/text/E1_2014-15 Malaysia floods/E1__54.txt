In Songkhla province, 1,000 survival kits were distributed to flood affected residents yesterday, though certain areas in the province are still facing the risk of landslides, especially in the hard-hit districts of Sadao, Na Thawee, Thepha and Saba Yoi. A centre has been set up in Na Thawee district to coordinate all relief efforts, especially in terms of storing and distributing drinking water.

Three districts in Phatthalung province are still flooded, while authorities are assessing the damage. Civilian authorities and military units are also participating in different relief efforts and helping distribute survival kits to affected residents. Some, 2,000 sets were handed out yesterday.

In Pattani province, some 1,000 households in urban areas are still under water, while 10,000 homes in outer areas have had some relief as flooding has receded.

Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha visited Narathiwat yesterday for the first time since becoming premier, and instructed provincial and security officials to jointly assist affected residents and ensure that relief operations are in place.

He added that Malaysian people living along the border would also be provided with assistance and relief.

At a briefing in Narathiwat’s Tak Bai district, he learned that 13,279 people from 4,432 households in 52 villages in all eight tambon had been affected. Floods have damaged 174 homes and inundated 13,191 rai of farmland and plantations.

Prayut told the press later that he had heard that some 40,000 Malaysians living along the border were suffering and that the government has contacted the neighbouring country to see what Thailand can do to help them out. “It’s an act of courtesy,” he said.
