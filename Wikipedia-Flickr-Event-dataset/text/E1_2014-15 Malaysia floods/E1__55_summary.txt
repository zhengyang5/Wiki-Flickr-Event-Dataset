Residents in the flood-hit far South have been warned to brace for more rain over the next two to three days as a tropical storm approaches.
The storm was moving southwest to the lower South China Sea at speeds of 15km per hour.
More rain and isolated heavy downpours are expected on Saturday and Sunday in areas south of Nakhon Si Thammarat.
The forecast came as floods in the far South started to ease off.
Narathiwat governor Natthapong Sirichana took staff into affected areas to offer aid supplies to people struggling with severe floods in Malaysia.
