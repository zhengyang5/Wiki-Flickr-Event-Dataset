KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 1 (Bernama) -- The Japanese government, via the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), has pledged emergency relief aid worth over RM500,000 for flood stricken states in Malaysia.

In a statement today, the Japanese embassy in Kuala Lumpur said this followed consultations with Malaysian authorities over the past several days.

"The government of Japan is ready to offer and provide immediate emergency relief facilities and equipment including generators, water purifiers and other humanitarian goods via Jica."

It said the government and people of Japan expressed heartfelt sympathy to the people of Malaysia over the massive flooding that forced a huge number of people in the affected areas to be evacuated.

"The Japanese government always stands ready to assist Malaysia in such tragic circumstances and earnestly hopes that the Malaysian government and its people will face the adversity with courage," it added.
