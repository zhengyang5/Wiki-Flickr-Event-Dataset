CAIRO: The Tamarod movement’s executive and administrative offices decided to call for an urgent general assembly on Monday to discuss the violations of members Hassan Shahin, Mohamed Abdel Aziz and Khaled Al-Qady.

In a statement issued late Saturday, the movement’s offices announced the suspension of Shahin, Aziz and Qady’s memberships until their violations are discussed.

Tamarod co-founders Shahin and Aziz announced their support Saturday for Hamdeen Sabbahi’s presidential candidacy, following his announcement to run for elections.

But the movement demanded the media deal directly with movement co-founders Mahmoud Badr and members Mohamed Nabawi, Mostafa al-Sweise and Maha Abu Bakr for interviews.
