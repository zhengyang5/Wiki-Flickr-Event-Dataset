The presidential elections take place when the revolution is in retreat among the masses and the counter-revolution is on the attack.
The counter-revolution aims to achieve a crushing victory over the revolutionary forces through the presidential elections in order to have the opportunity for further brutality and attacks on the revolution and freedoms.
The presidential elections express the dilemma of the Egyptian Revolution which led to the absence of a candidate who completely adopts the demands and goals of the revolution.
On this basis we call on Hamdeen Sabahi and his campaign to re-evaluate his support for the current regime which is restoring Mubarak’s state.
We will join the electoral battle to expose el-Sisi’s illusions and to destroy the idol which Mubarak's state is erecting as it rebuilds itself.
