The Socialist Popular Alliance Party has announced it will back Hamdeen Sabbahi in the upcoming presidential election.
Fahmy said the party was backing Sabahi because of his political background.
Sabahi would work to fulfil the demands of the January 2011 revolution and support marginalised people, he added.
Sabahi's Karama Party and Egyptian Popular Current, and the liberal Constitution Party, have also said they will support Sabahi's campaign.
The Socialist Popular Alliance Party is a leftist party formed shortly after the Egyptian revolution of 2011.
