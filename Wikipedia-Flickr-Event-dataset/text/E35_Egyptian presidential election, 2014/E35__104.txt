Nigeria president congratulates Egypt's Sisi

World Bulletin / News Desk

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has congratulated former army chief Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi for being elected Egypt's president and called on him to work to achieve national reconciliation in the country.

Jonathan urged al-Sisi to "fully dedicate himself to ending years of political turmoil in the north African country by working diligently for national reconciliation, peace, political stability and socioeconomic development," his spokesman Reuben Abati said in a statement on Wednesday.

"The president assures Mr al-Sisi of the support and cooperation of the federal government of Nigeria and looks forward to working with him to maintain and enhance the excellent bilateral relations which have long existed between Nigeria and Egypt," he added.

On Tuesday, al-Sisi was declared the winner of last week's presidential elections in Egypt, in which he has clinched almost 97 percent of the vote.

The Nigerian president urged Egyptians to "see the present moment as a new beginning for their country, and come together to work with other African countries to move the continent forward."

Al-Sisi had been serving as defense minister when the army ousted elected president Mohamed Morsi last July following massive protests against his one-year rule.

Nigeria was dodgy about the turmoil in Egypt, refusing to offer outright condemnation of the Morsi's ouster by the military.
