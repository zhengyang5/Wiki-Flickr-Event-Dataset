Presidential hopeful Hamdeen Sabbahi has announced that he will run in upcoming presidential elections regardless if Egypt's top military leader General Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi does so as well.
â€œI am the only presidential candidate so far," Sabbahi said in an interview on private satellite channel Al-Hayat TV on Saturday.
Would the army support its candidate or the interests of the people?
Sabbahi's statements come amidst unverified but widely-believed rumours that upcoming presidential elections will be held before the parliamentary ones, setting the stage for what many say will be El-Sisi's eventual presidency.
Sabbahi garnered 21.5 % of the popular vote in the 2012 presidential elections, coming in third place behind Mubarak-era official Ahmed Shafiq and eventual winner Morsi.
