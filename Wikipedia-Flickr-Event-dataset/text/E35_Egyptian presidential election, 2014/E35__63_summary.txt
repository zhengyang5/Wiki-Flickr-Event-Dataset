The April 6 Youth Movement-Democratic Front — a splinter group from the April 6 Youth Movement — announced in a press conference on Wednesday that its position in the upcoming presidential elections would be to let members decide whether to vote for Hamdeen Sabbahi or boycott the elections.
Last week, a court verdict rendered the activities of the April 6 Youth Movement and Democratic Front illegal and ordered the confiscation of all of their headquarters.
The movement was initially born in 2008 amid huge labor strikes and is widely recognized as one of the leading forces behind the 2011 uprising.
Sisi initially cooperated with the movement ahead of June 30 protests and was photographed with its leading figures following meetings.
The revolutionary socialists have also announced their opposition to Sisi and pledged their support to Sabbahi for the upcoming elections.
