By EMAN ALICAIRO: Amr Badr, coordinator of the Revolutionary Candidate campaign, in support of Hamdeen Sabbahi for president, denounced on Saturday the inviolability of the decisions of the Supreme Electoral Committee.
Badr, in a statement to Youm7, added that the campaign would study how to respond to this decision.
He explained that this may urge the campaign and its candidate Sabbahi to reconsider the whole situation of running for president.
He added that this step makes the sincerity of the guarantees made concerning the presidential elections doubtful.
On Saturday interim President Adly Mansour issued the presidential elections law, which states that decisions of the Supreme Electoral Committee are inviolable.
