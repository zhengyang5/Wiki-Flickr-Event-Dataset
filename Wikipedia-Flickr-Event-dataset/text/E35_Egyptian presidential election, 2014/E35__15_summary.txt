Egypt's presidential elections are due to take place on 26 and 27 May, the Presidential Elections Commission (PEC) – the judicial body overseeing the polls – announced on Sunday.
The first round of voting will be on 26 and 27 May, from 8am to 8pm.
In case of a tie, a run-off will be held on 16 and 17 June, with the final results announced 26 June.
Sunday's announcement from the PEC comes after weeks of debate over a controversial electoral law, widely believed to have caused the postponement.
The presidential electoral law, issued by interim President Adly Mansour on 8 March, stipulates that candidates cannot appeal the election results as announced by the PEC.
