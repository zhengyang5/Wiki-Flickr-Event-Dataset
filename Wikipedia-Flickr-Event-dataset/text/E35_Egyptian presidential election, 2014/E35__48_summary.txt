CAIRO (Reuters) - Leftist presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi says he doubts Egypt’s army chief will bring democracy if elected, citing alleged rights abuses since he toppled the country’s first democratically chosen leader.
Sisi is due to announce his candidacy within a week and is likely to win the presidential election by a landslide.
The popular uprising which ousted Mubarak in 2011 raised hopes of greater freedoms in Egypt, a country at the heart of the Arab world.
POLITICAL STATUS QUOSabahi, imprisoned 17 times under Mubarak, said Egypt was still awaiting a genuinely democratic system.
Like his hero Nasser - another autocratic leader whose “Arab socialism” failed to bring Egypt prosperity - Sabahi has long advocated farmers’ and workers’ rights.
