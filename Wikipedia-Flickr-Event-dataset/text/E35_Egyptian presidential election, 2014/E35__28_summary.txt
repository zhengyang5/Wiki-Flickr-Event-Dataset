By KAMEL KAMELCAIRO: The Salafist Nour Party is preparing its candidates for the upcoming parliamentary elections to win the maximum number of seats possible, party leader Sameh Abdel Hamid said on Sunday.
Hamid said the party does not want to repeat the mistake of the Muslim Brotherhood, which monopolized power and deprived other parties from participating.
The Nour Party wants all sides to work together in building the country, he said.
The Nour Party won 122 parliamentary seats, following the Brotherhoodâ€™s Freedom and Justice Party with 235.
The Wafd Party came in third place with 45 seats.
