The Socialist Popular Alliance Party has issued a statement calling for Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim to be replaced due to recent security violations.
At least 49 people were killed on Saturday's third anniversary of the revolution in clashes between the security forces and opposition groups, both Islamist and non-Islamist.
El-Sisi supporters took to the streets on Saturday, with many demanding he runs for the presidency.
Meanwhile, opponents of the army chief were attacked by security forces as well as by his civilian supporters.
The Socialist Popular Alliance party took part in the 30 June protests against Islamist president Mohamed Morsi and supported the roadmap put forth by the interim authorities after his ouster.
