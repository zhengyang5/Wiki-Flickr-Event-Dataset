The scale of turnout is seen as key to legitimising the winner.
It is the second presidential election since the 2011 revolution which toppled Hosni Mubarak.
Election officials said they would enforce a fine of over 500 Egyptian pounds ($72) for non-voting.
There has been no announcement from the Higher Election Commission on Monday's turnout, although Reuters news agency said the number of people casting their vote appeared lower than in previous elections.
The Associated Press news agency reported election monitoring groups as saying turnout was moderate, apart from in Islamist-dominated areas where it was low to non-existent.
