The window for registration in Egypt's upcoming presidential polls will close at 2pm on Sunday.
Egypt's presidential polls, the first to be held after the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi last July, are scheduled to take place on 26-27 May.
The Presidential Election Commission (PEC) – the five-member judicial body tasked with supervising Egypt's upcoming presidential polls – is scheduled to meet on Monday to announce the end of the election's first stage.
Sabahi argued that "the fact that El-Sisi swept the endorsements does not send an early signal that he will win the presidential election."
"Success in the presidential election battle depends on several other factors," he said.
