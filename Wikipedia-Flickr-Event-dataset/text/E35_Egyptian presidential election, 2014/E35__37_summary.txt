State TV news anchor Bothaina Kamel underwent a mandatory medical check up on Sunday morning, as stipulated by the High Elections Commission, as the first step toward formally running for president.
After a week of unconfirmed rumors, Kamel announced yesterday her intention to run in the upcoming elections.
This will be Kamelâ€™s second attempt at the presidency, after she failed to collect the necessary endorsements for the 2012 elections.
Ibrahim says that Kamel is coordinating with women rights organizations and volunteers in governorates to help in the collection of endorsements.
Kamel resigned from her job in state media following the 2011 uprising, before returning again as a news anchor in September 2012.
