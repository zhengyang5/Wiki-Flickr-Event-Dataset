The United States looks forward to working with Abdelfattah al-Sisi, the winner of Egypt's presidential election, to advance our strategic partnership and the many interests shared by the United States and Egypt.
We note that domestic and international observers concluded in their preliminary statements that Egyptâ€™s Presidential Electoral Commission (PEC) administered the election professionally and in line with Egyptian laws.
We also share concerns raised by observation groups about the restrictive political environment in which this election took place.
Egypt and its people have made clear their demands for dignity, justice, and political and economic opportunity.
The United States fully supports the democratic aspirations of the Egyptian people and we will stand with them as they pursue the future that they deserve.
