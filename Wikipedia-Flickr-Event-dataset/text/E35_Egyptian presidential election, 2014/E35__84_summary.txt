The percentage of Egyptians aiming to participate in the upcoming presidential elections has risen, with more youths now backing Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, say findings by Egyptian polling centre Baseera.
Egypt's 2014 presidential elections – scheduled to take place on 26-27 May locally, with expats due to vote overseas on 15-18 May – will see only two candidates face off: former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Nasserist politician Hamdeen Sabahi.
Asked whom they would vote for if elections were held tomorrow, 76 percent of respondents chose El-Sisi, 2 percent Sabahi and 15 percent were undecided.
The findings also indicate that the percentage of youths who support Sabahi has reached 4 percent, compared to 1 percent among Egyptians aged 50+ years.
According to Baseera, this poll was conducted in all of the nation's governorates using both cellular and landline phones on a probability sample of 2000 citizens aged 18 and above.
