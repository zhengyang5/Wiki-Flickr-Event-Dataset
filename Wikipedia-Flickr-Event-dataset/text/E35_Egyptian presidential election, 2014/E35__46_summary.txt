The Strong Egypt Party has rejected the nomination of Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, defense minister, considering it an infringement against the civil country and that it places military in face of any other candidate.
In a statement on Tuesday, the party said that the statement by Supreme Council of Armed Forces, which convened to mull the nomination of Sisi, affirms what they warned against, which is military engagement within politics.
The party assured the right of every civilian who fulfills the requirements in light of a political environment that allows honorable competition, and they warned that the nomination could become a confrontation between the state institutions and military leadership.
“What Egypt witnesses of political futility will not establish a country or achieve progress to it, Renaissance and civil state are not based on the old regime's leftovers, injustice, or absence of accountability.
Establishing states of interests within the Egyptian country threatens security of its people,” the statement added.
