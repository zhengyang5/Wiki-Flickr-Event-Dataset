CAIRO - The defeated candidate in Egypt's presidential election, Hamdeen Sabahi, appealed on Friday against results that gave former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi victory, saying election rules had been broken.
Leftist politician Sabahi won 3 percent of votes in the election against more than 93 percent of votes cast for Sisi, judicial sources said.
Official results have yet to be announced.

Sabahi came third in 2012 elections that brought Morsi to power as Egypt's first freely elected leader.
