Initial vote tallies show that El-Sisi had secured a historic victory, winning around 95 per cent of the vote at around 23 million votes.
According to sources, El-Sisi will be sworn in before the High Constitutional Court either on the morning of Saturday 7 June, or a few days later.
The rumours were quickly dismissed by Mansour's legal advisor, Ali Awad, who denied the possibility of delaying the inauguration of Egypt's new president.
Officials from El-Sisi's campaign also stressed that his historic victory was highly welcomed by a number of world leaders.
In internal terms, all agree that a politically fractious agenda awaits El-Sisi.
