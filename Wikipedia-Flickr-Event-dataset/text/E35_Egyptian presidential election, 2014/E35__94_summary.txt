Egypt's newly-elected president Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi appeared on television an hour after he was named the country's new leader to express his gratitude over the election results.
El-Sisi said that "now is the time for work", with the future goal being to realise the revolutions' goals of freedom, dignity, humanity and social justice.
"I am looking forward to your efforts and determination in building the upcoming stage," said El-Sisi.
The presidential election is the second milestone in a transitional road map announced by the army following the ouster of Mohamed Morsi last July.
The third and final step of the road map will be parliamentary elections, expected to take place by the end of the summer.
