Related Hamdeen Sabbahi plans presidential run

Leftist activist Khaled Ali has said he will not stand in the upcoming presidential election.

"I refuse to participate in this farce called an election," Khaled Ali announced at a press conference at the journalists syndicate on Sunday.

Ali, who stood for president in 2012, said there would only be real presidential candidates if the election law is amended, the protest law is cancelled and jailed activists are released.

The army should not get involved in politics, he noted.

"I am not against the army but if its commander wants to be a candidate he should first resign his position and spend two years in politics as a civilian," Ali said.

Army chief Field Marshall Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi is expected to announce his candidacy soon.

Nasserist politician Hamdeen Sabbahi is the only person to state he will stand for president. But the candidate registration process is yet to begin.
