The official campaign of leftist presidential hopeful Hamdeen Sabahi said on Tuesday that Egypt's government has dismissed a complaint it lodged against perceived bias shown by officials in favour of his main rival in the polls, ex-army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi.
"The campaign's legal advisor headed to the cabinet's headquarters on Tuesday afternoon to hand in the complaint, and after waiting for more than an hour, the secretariat refused to receive it," read the campaign's statement.
The secretariat gave no reasons for doing so, Sabahi’s team added, saying the complaint would be resent to the cabinet and submitted to the country's electoral committee through documented post.
The article also holds the state responsible for guaranteeing the "safety, neutrality and integrity of referendums and election procedures."
The leftist's campaign team has repeatedly voiced concerns over alleged harassment by El-Sisi’s supporters or bias from workers at notary offices as they tour cities to gather the 25,000 signatures needed for Sabahi to be eligible as a candidate.
