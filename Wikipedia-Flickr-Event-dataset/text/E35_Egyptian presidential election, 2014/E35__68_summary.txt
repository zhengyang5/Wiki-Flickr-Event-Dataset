In a press conference held at the headquarters of the Socialist Popular Alliance (SPA) Saturday, the party officially announced it is backing the presidential bid of Nasserist Hamdeen Sabahi.
Shukr further added that voting for Sabahi in the upcoming elections is considered "a victory for democratic development, social justice and popular will.
He added that if the elections were turned into a referendum on only one candidate, then it would have meant the establishment of a "totalitarian state."
On Friday, the secretary-general of the SPA told Ahram Online that the decision to back Sabahi was voted for by 90 percent of party members.
Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Hamdeen Sabahi are the only candidates.
