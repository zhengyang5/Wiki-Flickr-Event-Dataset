The policemen dragged Abdul Samad and forced him to enter the security office at Al-Shohada station, the statement said, pointing out that the number of policemen assaulted him by beating and insulting him, until the officer arrived.

The officer reportedly asked them to stop assaulting the Karama member, and asked Abdul Samad to show his identification card.

Mona Mahrous, member of legal committee at Hamdeen Sabbahi’s campaign, has accompanied Abdul Samad to the October 6 Hospital to confirm his injuries, in order to take legal measures against the assailants, Spokesperson of Hamdeen Sabbahi’s campaign Heba Yassin told The Cairo Post.

“It is not the first time for a policemen to assault one of the Sabbahi’s campaign members,” she said, pointing out that a policeman has assaulted a number of Hamdeen’s campaigners while they were presenting endorsements for the nominee at the Kafr el-Sheikh Notary Office.
