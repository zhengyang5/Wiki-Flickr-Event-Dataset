Zamalek Sports Club chief Mortada Mansour backtracked on Saturday on his bid for Egypt’s presidency, announcing stepping out of the race slated for 26 and 27 May after seeing a "vision in his sleep."
“I dreamt I was on board a bus to Fum al-Khaleeg (a district of Cairo),” Mansour said in a press conference on Saturday.
“I found two army generals sitting next to me… ‘we are going to Old Cairo, not Heliopolis,’ they told me.
Mansour did not explain how the vision was a sign that he had to step down, but said he would support the former defense minister.
“I say to Field Marshal al-Sisi I personally support you, but some people in your campaign are not qualified,” Mansour said.
