Presidential hopeful Hamdeen Sabbahi has accused his rival's campaign, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, of bribing citizens to sign endorsements for the former defense minister's candidacy.
Presidential elections are slated for 26 and 27 May.
On Saturday, the Presidential Elections Commission said the deadline had passed for accepting nominations, leaving Sabbahi and Sisi as the only eligible candidates.
Sisi’s campaign member and founder of Tamarod movement, Mahmoud Badr, rebuffed the accusations on his facebook page, arguing that such claims "should not come out from people of high standing."
According to Sabbahi, Sisi’s victory in the upcoming elections would bolster the Muslim Brotherhood’s argument that the removal of Mohamed Morsy in 2013 was a military coup.
