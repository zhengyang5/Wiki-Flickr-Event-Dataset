Sabahi's plan consists of seven aspects – fighting terrorism, implementing transitional justice, increasing Egypt's crops and farmers' incomes and improving healthcare and education.
The fight against terrorismAmr Salah, a leading figure in Sabahi's campaign, presented Sabahi's "National Counter-Terrorism Strategy", which includes fighting terrorism by abolishing its root causes – poverty and unemployment – which Salah said "make youth more vulnerable to being recruited by terrorist organisations."
Sabahi's plan, according to El-Haddad, includes stopping drainage water and factory waste from passing into the Nile.
HealthcareFormer health minister Amr Helmy introduced Sabahi's healthcare plan.
Accordingly, Helmy said that Sabahi's plan includes a "social healthcare programme that does not distinguish between social classes and education levels."
