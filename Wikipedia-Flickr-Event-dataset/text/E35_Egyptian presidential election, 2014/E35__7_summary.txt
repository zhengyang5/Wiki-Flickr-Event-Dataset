The campaign of retired field marshal Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said he won 23.38 million votes, with left-wing politician Hamdeen Sabahi taking 735,285.
Invalid votes were 1.07 million, or nearly 350,000 more than the number of votes for the 59-year-old Sabahi.
Still, el-Sissi can genuinely claim he comes into office with an impressive vote tally â€” his campaign said he won 23.38 million votes.
Critics said the lack of enthusiasm at the polls was in part due to apathy among even el-Sissi supporters, knowing that his victory was a foregone conclusion.
Two el-Sissi backers scribbled words of support on posters of the candidate that had been defaced with insulting graffiti.
