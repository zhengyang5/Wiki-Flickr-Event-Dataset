In the first press conference held by Al-Sisi’s presidential campaign, Abu Shoqqa said the campaign was able to collect 75,000 signatures on the day the floor for collecting signatures was opened, 31 March.
Abu Shoqqa displayed different criteria adopted while submitting the signatures of support.
“It would have taken two days to submit all 500,000 signatures,” Abu Shoqqa said.
He added that the campaign only submitted electronic signatures to facilitate the mission of the SEC when counting the signatures.
The campaign submitted signatures from each governorate proportionate to the latter’s voting population, Abu Shoqqa said.
