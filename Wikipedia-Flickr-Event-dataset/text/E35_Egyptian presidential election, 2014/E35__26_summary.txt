Egypt's interim head of state Adly Mansour will not run for president in elections slated for next year, a Kuwaiti newspaper on Tuesday quoted him as saying.
Mansour was sworn in as interim president on 4 July, a day after the Egyptian army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi following nationwide mass protests against his one-year rule.
Morsi had appointed Mansour as head of the constitutional court, but the latter was not sworn in as head of the court until hours before he took the oath as interim president.
When asked by Kuwait's Al-Seyassah newspaper whether he would run for president, Mansour said:"No... No, I will return to my office and my work at the constitutional court."
El-Sisi has emerged as Egypt's most popular public figure and analysts say he would become president if he ran for office.
