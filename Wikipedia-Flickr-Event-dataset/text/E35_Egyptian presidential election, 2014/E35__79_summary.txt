The European Union Election Observer Mission (EOM) for the upcoming presidential elections has reversed its decision to scale back its operation after “administrative challenges” were overcome, announced Chief Observer Mario David in a Monday press conference.
“Because of the delays, we need to adjust our mission in order to operate in line with our standard observation rules,” said David.
A core team of 10 election analysts arrived in Egypt on 18 April, followed by 30 observers a week later.
David confirmed on Monday that the equipment had been released and was in the possession of the mission by Sunday night.
The presidential elections are slated to be held on 26 and 27 May.
