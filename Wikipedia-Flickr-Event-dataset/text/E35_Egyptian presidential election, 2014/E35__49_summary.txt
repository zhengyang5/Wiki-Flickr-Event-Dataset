Since the June 30 mass protests that ousted President Mohamed Morsi, Sisi has gained immense popularity in the Egyptian street.
The Brotherhood has persistently protested against the army and its leader Sisi, the post-June 30 government, and the Interior Ministry, as they raged against the toppling of their “legitimately elected president Mohamed Morsi.”After Sisi announced his bid, the Brotherhood’s reactions were clear.
Some of them claimed that Sisi would become president through “vote rigging,” and others thought he would not be able to achieve the people’s demands.
The April 6 Youth Movement and the April 6 Democratic Front, separated over administrative differences, both refuse to support Sisi’s bid.
Other parties, like the Revolutionary Path Front and the Dostour Party have officially rejected Sisi’s bid for president in a Thursday statement in Al-Ahram newspaper.
