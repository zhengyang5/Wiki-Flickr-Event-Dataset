The Constitution Party elected a new head in February, Hala Shukrallah, who became the first Coptic Christian woman to lead an Egyptian party.
In a survey held within the Constitution Party regarding its stance towards the upcoming polls, Shukrallah said that nearly 60 percent were in favour of backing Sabahi, while 10 percent went for El-Sisi.
The Constitution Party and Sabahi, on the other hand, say they would rather "work to snatch freedoms" than boycott the polls altogether.
Sabahi said that if he does not win the presidency, he would still work to form a "strong opposition."
The Constitution Party on Wednesday further reiterated its call for all political detainees to be released and for the protest law responsible for their arrest to be cancelled.
