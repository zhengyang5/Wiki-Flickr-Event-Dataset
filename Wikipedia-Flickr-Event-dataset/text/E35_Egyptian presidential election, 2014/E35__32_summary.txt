Former prime minister and presidential hopeful Ahmed Shafiq has announced that he will not run in Egypt's upcoming presidential elections, claiming that the polls will witness "unethical behaviour."
In a statement released on Thursday, Shafiq also stressed that he will support Egypt's army chief Abdel El-Fattah El-Sisi if he should run.
The defence minister is widely expected to win the elections should he declare his candidacy.
Shafiq's statement clarified that he didn't have an official presidential campaign and expressed outrage over the recent use of his name and photos suggesting that he did.
Last week Shafiq came under fire for a leaked audio clip in which he criticised El-Sisi's anticipated presidential bid.
