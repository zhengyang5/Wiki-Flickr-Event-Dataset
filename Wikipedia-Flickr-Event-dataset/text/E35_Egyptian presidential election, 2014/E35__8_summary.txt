With nearly all ballots counted, former military chief Sisi appeared set for a crushing victory amid lingering doubts about the government’s turnout figures.
Turnout was estimated at more than 46 percent after officials extended voting to a third day, according to interim President Adly Mansour.
That figure was lower than the 52 percent turnout in the 2012 presidential election that vaulted Morsi to power.
Even so, Sisi can genuinely claim he comes into office with an impressive vote tally of 23.38 million votes – significantly more than the 13 million won by Morsi two years ago.
Boycotting a vote, he said, is a form of freedom of expression and one should not forget these “silent” voters.
