The European Union extended congratulations to former military chief Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi for his elections victory this week, saying the conclusion of elections “marks an important step in the implementation of the constitutional roadmap towards the transition to democracy in Egypt”.
The statement issued on Thursday also raised some concerns about the political environment in Egypt leading up to and during presidential elections.
The European Union also called for credible investigations of violence since 30 June and the review of death sentences handed down to accused in mass trials.
“The EU hopes that the period ahead, particularly with parliamentary elections in view, will be marked by a spirit of dialogue aimed at reducing political division,” said the European Union.
The EU deployed an elections observer mission that concluded earlier this week that the elections were conducted within the law but “in an environment falling short of constitutional principles”.
