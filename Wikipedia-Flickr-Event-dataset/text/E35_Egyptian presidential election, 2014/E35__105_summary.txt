In an official statement issued on Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague congratulated former military chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi for becoming Egypt's new president.
Urging a transition towards accountable and democratic governance in Egypt, Hague expressed support to the Egyptian people in their aspiration for greater economic opportunities.
Spoilt votes exceeded the votes for Sabahi, with 1,040,608 invalidated ballots.
El-Sisi appeared on television an hour after he was named the country's new leader to express his gratitude over the election results.
El-Sisi announced that "now is the time for work," with the future target being to realise the revolutions' goals of freedom, dignity, humanity and social justice.
