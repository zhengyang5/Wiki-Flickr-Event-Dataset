Egyptian coup leader al-Sisi announces presidential candidacyBy Johannes Stern28 March 2014On Wednesday night, Egyptian coup leader Field Marshall Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi officially declared his plan to run for president in upcoming elections.
Sisi cynically sought to wrap his declaration of war against the working class in the mantle of democracy.
It has banned the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), Egypt’s main bourgeois opposition party, issued an anti-protest law and enshrined continued military rule in the constitution.
On Monday, an Egyptian court, in an act of political mass murder, sentenced 529 MB supporters to death.
Sisi’s speech comes amidst a deepening social crisis and a renewed explosion of working class struggles.
