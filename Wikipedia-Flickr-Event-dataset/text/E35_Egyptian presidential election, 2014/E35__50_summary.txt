The 6 April Youth Movement has said a presidential campaign by Minister of Defence Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi would only serve to further divide and polarise Egyptian society.
“The defence minister running for the post of president of the republic would not benefit the divided nation and will not achieve the objectives of the revolution,” said the youth movement in a Wednesday statement.
Since Al-Sisi announced the removal of Mohamed Morsi as president in July 2013 he has enjoyed wide popular support in Egypt.
The defence minister has received endorsements to run for president from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Al-Sisi must resign from the military in order to announce his candidacy for president under the current constitution.
