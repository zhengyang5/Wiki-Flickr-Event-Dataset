Presidential hopeful Hamdeen Sabbahi’s official campaign expressed its discontent with a new law issued on Saturday which regulates the upcoming presidential elections.
The campaign stressed that it strongly opposes Article 7 of the law, which bans appeals against the decisions of the commission.
“The condition for running in any elections is the presence of guarantees for its seriousness, transparency and consistency with global standards,” read the statement.
Sabbahi, a Nasserist politician who came third in the 2012 presidential elections, is the only candidate to have so far announced his intention to run in elections expected this spring.
The Presidential Elections Commission is expected to meet on Sunday or Monday to start preparations for the upcoming polls.
