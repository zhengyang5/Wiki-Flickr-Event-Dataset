Controversial lawyer Mortada Mansour announced on Saturday that he would not run in Egypt's upcoming presidential elections, after having declared his candidacy less than a week ago.
Mansour announced last Sunday that he would become the third candidate in the elections after former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and leftist political figure Hamdeen Sabahi.
However, Mansour retreated from his previous stance on Saturday, claiming that his decision to withdraw comes despite having collected 20,000 recommendation forms.
He also said he had received a sign from God that El-Sisi would win the race.
He went on to slam presidential runner Sabahi â€“ currently the only candidate running against El-Sisi.
