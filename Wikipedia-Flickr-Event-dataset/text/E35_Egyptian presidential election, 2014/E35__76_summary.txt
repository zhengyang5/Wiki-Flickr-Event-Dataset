The late Tuesday decision to extend the originally planned two-day vote until Wednesday came amid continuous reports of unexpectedly low voter turnout.
Egypt's Presidential Elections Commission (PEC) said the extension was made in response to popular calls for greater opportunities.
Calls also emerged from numerous Sabahi backers beseeching him to pull out of the election.
Sabahi said his campaign was subjected to a large spectrum of violations and abuses, including security forces banning its representatives from entering polling stations and expelling others in the process of monitoring the vote.
Sabahi, the veteran opposition figure who came third in the 2012 elections, affirmed however that staying in the race was the only way out.
