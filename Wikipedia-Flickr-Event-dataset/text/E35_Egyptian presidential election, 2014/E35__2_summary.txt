The Presidential Elections Commission (PEC) announced that the voter turnout was 25,587,223 million, which equates to 47.5% of registered voters.
It is speculated that the extension was a result of the low voter turnout on the first two days.
The Presidential Elections Law stipulates that they can be fined up to EGP 500, approximately $70.
There were similar suggestions by government officials to fine abstainers after the 2012 presidential elections.
Over 24 million people abstained from voting in the second round, but the suggestions to fine them were never implemented.
