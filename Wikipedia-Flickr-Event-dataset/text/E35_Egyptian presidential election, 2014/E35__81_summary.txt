Fifty-nine percent of Egyptians are undecided about who to vote for in the upcoming presidential election, according to an opinion poll.
The poll, conducted by the Egyptian Centre for Public Opinion Research (Baseera), showed 84 percent of Egyptians intend to vote in the election, while 16 percent do not.
Thirty-nine percent said they would vote for former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, down from 51 percent in an earlier poll in mid-March.
Forty-two percent of those who said they would vote for El-Sisi live in cities, while 36 percent live in the countryside.
Men (41 percent) are more likely to say they will vote for El-Sisi than women (36 percent).
