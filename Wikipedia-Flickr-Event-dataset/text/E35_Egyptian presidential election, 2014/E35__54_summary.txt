Around 50 leading members of Tamarod (Rebel) have issued a statement backing Hamdeen Sabbahi for president.
Tamarod's Qalioubiya chapter will also be supporting Sabbahi and rejects the expulsion of members for opposing El-Sisi's candidacy, its coordinator Khaled Saad said on Sunday.
All Tamarod members in Qalioubiya oppose a presidential bid by El-Sisi, Saad told Al-Ahram Arabic news website, because it would allow people to describe what happened on 30 June as a coup.
Some Tamarod members are calling for a breakaway group because founder Mahmoud Badr insists on supporting El-Sisi and takes harsh action against those who oppose him, Saad said.
Saad added that he was communicating with expelled members Shahin and Abdul-Aziz about launching a new group called Revolutionary Tamarod.
