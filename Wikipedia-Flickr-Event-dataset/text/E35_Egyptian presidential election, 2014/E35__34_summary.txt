Outspoken and controversial lawyer Mortada Mansour announced on Sunday that he would run in Egypt's upcoming presidential elections, becoming the third candidate after former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and leftist political figure Hamdeen Sabahi.
In a press conference held to announce his candidacy, Mansour said he was running in order to restore "order" to Egypt.
"Egypt is currently in a dark tunnel, we need to restore the state of order and law," he said.
Concerning his electoral program, Mansour promised to end all strikes and protests in the country.
According to the Camp David accords, Egypt's army can only be deployed in certain areas of the Sinai Peninsula.
