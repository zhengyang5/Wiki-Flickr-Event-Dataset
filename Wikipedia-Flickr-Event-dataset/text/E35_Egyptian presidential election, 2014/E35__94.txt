Egypt's newly-elected president Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi appeared on television an hour after he was named the country's new leader to express his gratitude over the election results.

"My emotions are mixed with happiness and aspiration: my happiness for what you have achieved and my aspiration to be worthy of your trust," said the ex-defence minister, who became the country's most popular figure after he announced the ouster of his predecessor Mohamed Morsi last year.

"What was realised in both stages of the road map came as a normal result of the sacrifices of Egyptians in both the 25 January and 30 June revolutions," he said, adding that he is certain that Egyptians are aware of "threats facing the country".

El-Sisi said that "now is the time for work", with the future goal being to realise the revolutions' goals of freedom, dignity, humanity and social justice.

El-Sisi, who garnered 96.91 percent of the vote, saluted the army, the police and judges for their role in ensuring the electoral procedure turned out "credible and transparent".

He also expressed his respect to his only rival, Nasserist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, saying he gave a chance for the race to be "competitive".

"I am looking forward to your efforts and determination in building the upcoming stage," said El-Sisi.

According to sources who spoke to Ahram Online, El-Sisi will be sworn in before the High Constitutional Court either on Saturday morning, 7 June, or a few days later.

The presidential election is the second milestone in a transitional road map announced by the army following the ouster of Mohamed Morsi last July. The third and final step of the road map will be parliamentary elections, expected to take place by the end of the summer.
