The EU is a leading global actor in providing and financing electoral assistance complementary to election observation.
With these objectives in mind, the European Union has become a leading force in international election observation.
Since 2000 over 120 EU Election Observation Missions (EU EOMs) have been deployed to all continents (with the exception of the OSCE region), following a long-term observation methodology to assess election processes according to international standards and best practices for genuine democratic elections.
In addition to election observation, the European Commission is engaged in election assistance, which provides technical or material support to electoral processes.
The purpose of EU election observation missions (EOMs) is to assist partner countries in holding elections of a high standard.
