By AMIRA EL-FEKKICAIRO: Thirty-nine percent of Egyptians surveyed will vote for Field Marshal Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, said the Baseera Egyptian Center for Public Opinion and Research Sunday.
However, these numbers reflect a drop from his 51 percent support in a previous poll conducted and published in mid-March.
The High Presidential Elections Commission opened the door for presidential candidates to apply from March 31 to April 20, and it will announce the final list of candidates soon after that.
Sisi announced his presidential bid on state TV last Wednesday, “in response to popular demand” calling for him to run in elections.
Sabbahi, who announced his bid in early February, is now seeking to make a public announcement on state TV on the grounds of “equal chances” for candidates, his campaign said this week.
