The Misr Balady (Egypt My Country) Front hosted a press conference calling on Defence Minister General Abdel Fatah Al-Sisi to run for presidency at Cairo Stadium on Tuesday.
The speakers also called on the Egyptian people to “celebrate the memory of 25 January revolution with the police and the armed forces”.
At the end of the press conference, patriotic song Teslam Al-Ayady (Praise the Hands) was played.
The song has turned viral since the military-backed 3 July ouster of former President Mohamed Morsi as a sign for the support of the armed forces and its leadership.
“Egyptians gave two Yes [votes] in the referendum: one for the constitution and the other for Al-Sisi’s run for the presidency,” said Abdel Sattar.
