CAIRO: The Salafist Nour Party is preparing its candidates for the upcoming parliamentary elections to win the maximum number of seats possible, party leader Sameh Abdel Hamid said on Sunday.

“We do not want the presidency, but acquiring a parliament majority will provide us with an opportunity to serve the country and implement our developmental projects, especially since we have competent members and specialized scientific research experts who can lead ministries,” Abdel Hamid told Youm7.

Hamid said the party does not want to repeat the mistake of the Muslim Brotherhood, which monopolized power and deprived other parties from participating. The Nour Party wants all sides to work together in building the country, he said.

He said he believes the party is popular, is on good terms with state institutions, and did well in the parliamentary elections of 2012, despite that year being the first political opportunity for Salafists in Egypt.

The Nour Party won 122 parliamentary seats, following the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party with 235. The Wafd Party came in third place with 45 seats.
