The liberal Freedom Egypt party, headed by Amr Hamzawy, has said it will support Hamdeen Sabahi in the presidential election, Aswat Masriya reported on Tuesday.
In a statement, the party said the decision came after an internal vote and despite the absence of a candidate whose views fully match its own.
Leftist politician Sabahi is the only challenger to former military chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who is expected to win by a landslide in the vote on 26/27 May.
The party said it would "support the candidate with views closest to those of the party and who will achieve the goals of the Egyptian revolution and preserve its principals."
Freedom Egypt secretary-general Shaheer George told Ahram Online that the party had reservations over the presidential election law, which places the election committee above judicial review.
