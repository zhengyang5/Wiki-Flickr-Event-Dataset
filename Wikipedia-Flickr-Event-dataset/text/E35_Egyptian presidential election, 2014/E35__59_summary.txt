By NOURHAN MAGDICAIRO: The Revolutionary Socialists called on Egyptians to vote for Hamdeen Sabbahi against Field Marshal Abdel Fatah al-Sisi during the forthcoming presidential elections, in a Sunday statement on their official website.
“The Revolutionary Socialists have decided to participate in the [presidential] elections and not to boycott.
It is the right decision for the current political situation, in order to promote publicity against the counter-revolution’s candidate,” read the statement.
However, the movement also criticized Sabbahi’s “silent stances” regarding the violations against freedom committed by the army and the interior ministry.
The presidential elections are due May 26-27.
