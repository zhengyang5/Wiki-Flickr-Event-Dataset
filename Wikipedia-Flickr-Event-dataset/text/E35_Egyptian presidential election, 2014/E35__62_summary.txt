The Egyptian Social Democratic Party voted on Saturday against backing any particular candidate in the coming presidential elections and leave the decision up to each individual member.
The party was split between backing former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, backing Nasserist figure Hamdeen Sabahi or not backing any particular candidate.
Member of the party's supreme committee Karim Kenany told Al-Ahram's Arabic news website that the majority of the party voted to abstain from backing a particular candidate so as to creating party divisions.
Meanwhile, the liberal Wafd Party, the Conference Party, the Tagammu Party as well as others have announced their support for El-Sisi.
The presidential elections are to take place on 26 and 27 May.
