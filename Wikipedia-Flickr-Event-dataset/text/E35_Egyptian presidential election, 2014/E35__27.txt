Amr Moussa, chairman of the constitutional committee, told reporters on Thursday that he will not run in the upcoming presidential elections, instead deferring his candidacy to Defense Minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

“People want al-Sisi,” he added.

Moussa had on Thursday told the Saudi Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that Sisi is in the process of making the decision to run in the upcoming presidential elections.

The defense minister has become widely promoted since his role on 3 July in ousting Egypt's first democratically-elected president, Mohamed Morsy, who quickly grew very unpopular as many felt he had mismanaged the economy.
