A poll conducted by Egyptian polling centre, Baseera, in cooperation with a program called "Yahdoth fi Misr" (Happening in Egypt), shows former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi receiving the support of over half of the population.
Responding to the question concerning preference for either of the two candidates, 72 percent of respondents backed El-Sisi while only two percent backed his sole contender, Nasserist figure Hamdeen Sabahi.
The poll shows El-Sisi is more popular among older generations, supported by 69 percent of respondents between the age of 18 and 29 and 75 percent of respondents over the age of 50.
Meanwhile, Sabahi holds the support of five percent of respondents between age 18 to 29 and only one percent of respondents over 50 years of age.
The sample included respondents from the age of 18 and above and covered all of Egypt's governorates.
