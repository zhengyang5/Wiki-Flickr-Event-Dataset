AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah on Sunday attended the inauguration ceremony of Egypt’s elected President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.
The King, who returned home later in the day, also attended a lunch banquet held by Sisi in honour of leaders taking part in the inauguration ceremony.
The retired field marshal became Egypt’s second elected president since a popular uprising overthrew longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011, unleashing more than three years of unrest.
In the run-up to the election, Sisi said that “national security” takes precedence over democratic freedoms.
The Saudi king was represented at inauguration ceremony by Crown Prince Salman Bin Abdulaziz, alongside the rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain.
