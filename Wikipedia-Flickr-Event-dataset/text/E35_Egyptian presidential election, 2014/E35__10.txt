Egypt has finished up the first election since longtime President Hosni Mubarak was ousted - and arguably the first free and fair vote since Egypt's experiment with parliamentary democracy in the 1920s.

The Muslim Brotherhood, through its Freedom and Justice Party, took about 45 per cent, while the Nour Party, representing ultraconservative Salafis, took about 22 per cent. Secular liberals and leftists won just 16 per cent. Parties whose membership has been tied to Mubarak - the so-called "felool" - managed to win roughly 5 per cent.
