Egypt's former chief of staff General Sami Anan announced on Thursday that he would not run in the country's upcoming presidential elections.
Anan stressed that he cared for the unity of the army as well, a possible reference to the logistical problem of the military fielding two presidential hopefuls.
Anan's announcement comes after months of affirmations from his presidential campaign team that he would contest the elections.
Other reports claimed that his presidential campaign was being supported by the Brotherhood.
Egypt's interim President Adly Mansour said on Wednesday that the presidential polls would end before 17 July, paving the way for parliamentary elections.
