In an interview with Aswat Masriya news website on Monday, Tarek Nour, chief advertising advisor for the official campaign of presidential hopeful Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, said LE12 million has been spent so far on advertising to promote the ex-minister of defence in the upcoming polls.
Nour, a pioneer of advertising in Egypt who is also the general coordinator of El-Sisi’s campaign, says LE6 million has been spent on press conferences, with the remaining LE6 million used in TV and radio ads as well as posters and billboards.
He added that companies usually lower their prices when they are told the advertising is for El-Sisi’s campaign.
In the case of a run-off campaign, spending will be limited to LE5 million, instead of LE2 million.
He also said that the campaign has hired Tarek Nour Communications – owned by Nour himself – to run the advertising component.
