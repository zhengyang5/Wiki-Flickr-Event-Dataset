Prominent leftist politician Hamdeen Sabbahi announced on Saturday that he will run for president in this year's elections.
Sabbahi, who finished third the 2012 presidential race -- behind eventual winner Mohamed Morsi and Hosni Mubarak-era premier Ahmed Shafiq -- announced his candidacy at an event in Cairo.
The founder of the Popular Current group has more than once expressed his intention to run for president over the past few weeks.
Speaking on Saturday evening, Sabbahi said he would cooperate with anyone in the upcoming presidential race except those "who consider the 30 June protests a coup, or the 25 January revolution a conspiracy."
The Popular Current will hold a press conference soon, Sabbahi said during his announcement.
