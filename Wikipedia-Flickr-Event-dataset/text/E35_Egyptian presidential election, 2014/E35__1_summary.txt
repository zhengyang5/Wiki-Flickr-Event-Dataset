Egypt's Presidential Elections Commission (PEC) has declared former military chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi Egypt's new president, confirming that he won 23.78 million votes (96.91 percent) in the 26-28 May election.
According to Judge Anwar El-Assi, 25,578,233 voted in the elections, a turnout of 47.5 percent.
The official results announced by the PEC cannot be appealed, as per the presidential election law issued by interim President Adly Mansour on 8 March.
The European Union had 150 monitors across Egypt, which the EU said maintained their impartiality, neither legitimising the Egyptian electoral process nor validating the election results.
The presidential election is the second milestone in a transitional road map announced by the army following the ouster of Mohamed Morsi last July.
