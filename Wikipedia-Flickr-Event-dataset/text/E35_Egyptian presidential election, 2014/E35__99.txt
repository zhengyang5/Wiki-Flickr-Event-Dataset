Sheikh Khalifa, the President, on Tuesday night sent a congratulatory cable to Abdel Fattah El Sisi after his win in Egypt’s elections, pledging the UAE’s support.

In his cable, Sheikh Khalifa said: “Congratulations on the precious trust given to you by the brotherly people of Egypt in facing the challenges they are experiencing, and to achieve their aspirations and ambitions in stability, development, progress, prosperity, pride and dignity.”

Mr El Sisi won 96.1 per cent of the vote, according to Egypt’s electoral commission on Tuesday.

Sheikh Khalifa continued: “We are moving with honest determination and a strong will to support our brothers in Egypt; dear to all of us at all levels, and to stand by their side in all circumstances.

“We look forward with confidence to working with you for the good of our peoples and the Arab nation, expressing to you my most sincere wishes of good luck and success in leading the march of the Egyptian brotherly people towards greater stability, development, and evolution.”

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai, sent a similar cable of congratulations to Mr El Sisi.

Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah said the Egyptian ex-army chief’s win was a “historic day and a new stage for Egypt” in a telegram published by SPA state news agency. He also called for a donors conference to help Egypt through its economic troubles.
