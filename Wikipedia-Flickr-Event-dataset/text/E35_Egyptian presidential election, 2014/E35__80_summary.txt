A surprising 48 percent of Egyptians have not yet chosen who they are going to vote for in the upcoming presidential elections, according to The Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research, also known as Baseera.
Bassera had conducted a public opinion poll in late February on Egyptians participating in the upcoming presidential elections, including whether or not they will participate in the elections and their opinion on who is the best to be the president of Egypt.
The study also indicated that the majority, almost 51 percent of Egyptians, intend to vote for the current defense minister, Field Marshal Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, though to date Sisi has yet not announced his candidacy in the presidential elections.
The results indicate that 81 percent of Egyptians in urban governorates intend to participate in the upcoming presidential elections, compared to 86 percent in Lower Egypt, and 79 percent in Upper Egypt.
The percentage of those who do not intend to participate in the upcoming presidential elections rises from 7 percent in Lower Egypt to 14 percent in urban governorates and 16 percent in Upper Egypt.
