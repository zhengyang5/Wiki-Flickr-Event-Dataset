4:55 In an early morning speech on Thursday, Younes Makhyoun, head of the ultra-conservative Nour Party, thanked party members for participating in the campaign to support El-Sisi’s candidacy, according to Al-Ahram’s Arabic news website.

He asked God to consider their work as “good deeds" as they spent a lot of effort and dedicated their time and energy, despite being put in danger and criticised.

"I think the results, God willing, will be in the benefit of the country and its stability and cohesion," he said.

He added that his party was optimistic about the coming period and asked God to deliver good fortune via El-Sisi.

Previously a supporter of Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood movement, the Salafist Nour Party has since emerged as a backer of Egypt's interim government after Morsi's ouster, publicly supporting its transitional road map and El-Sisi's presidential candidacy.

Sabahi 2,841 (4.99%)

Spoilt 5,418

Turnout: 16.76%

El-Sisi's popularity has spread over the border to Egypt's western neighbour, where Libyans praise the former defence minister's crackdown on Islamist militants at home, a scenario that they hope to repeat in their own country.

01:30 Judge Tarek Shebl, a member of the general secretariat of the Presidential Elections Commission (PEC), the judicial body supervising the poll, tells Al-Ahram’s Arabic news website that an estimated 25 million voters have cast their ballots.

He added that the official results will be announced either Sunday or Monday, 1 or 2 June, instead of the scheduled date of Thursday, 5 June, which coincides with the 47th anniversary of the 1967 Six-Day War, which led to the Israeli occupation of the Sinai Peninsula, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and the Golan Heights.

01:10 So it goes: Sabahi's hometown victory didn't last long. The final vote count of all polling centres in Balteem show the Nasserist candidate was closely defeated by his rival. However, he triumphed over the spoilt ballots, unlike at other centres across the country:

El-Sisi 9,085

Sabahi 8,411

Spoilt 482

01:05 Meanwhile, Egypt's interim Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab tells MBC Masr he will resign from his post once Egypt's new president is sworn in.

00:55 A spokesman for El-Sisi’s campaign is already speaking like a winner, thanking the "Egyptian people for putting their trust in Field Marshal Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi".



Speaking to satellite Channel MBC Masr, spokesman Abdallah El-Moghazy said El-Sisi’s campaign didn't need the additional day of voting, citing the ex-army chief’s sweeping victory.

He said the media scared people by saying there was a low voter turnout, which he claimed was not true.

El-Moghazy said Egyptians went to polling centres for only one “motive”: the love of Egypt and beliefs in El-Sisi – unlike the temptations offered in the era of Hosni Mubarak, when bread, oil and grains were offered to get people to vote, he said.

00:50 Sabahi's hometown of Balteem in Kafr El-Sheikh governorate hasn’t let him down, according to privately-owned daily Al-Shorouk. The Nasserist, who until this moment is suffering from a nationwide drastic loss against his rival El-Sisi, won 906 of votes to the field marshal’s 675 at one polling centre in the town.

00:45 Ahram Online’s Ayat Al-Tawy is reporting from the highly-secured Maadi and Torah polling centre in south Cairo, where she says the presiding judges have announced the following tally:

El-Sisi 94,073

Sabahi 4,627

Spoilt 5877

Registered voters: 198,545

00:40 Here are the unofficial results from Cairo's Qasr Al-Nil central polling station:

El-Sisi 17,137

Sabahi 732

Spoilt 757

Registered voters: 34,334

0:35 As an El-Sisi victory grows more certain, hundreds of Egyptians have gathered at the presidential palace in Cairo’s upscale Heliopolis district for an early celebration. The scene at the palace and the nearby Korba neighbourhood is dominated by El-Sisi posters and Egyptian flags being waved above the crowds.

00:30 According to Samir Omar, head of Sky News Arabia's Cairo bureau, Judge Mohamed Khairy has been transported to a hospital after he was shot while on his way to a central polling centre in Qalioubiya’s Benha to hand in votes.

00:05 Participation is high in North Sinai – over 40 percent – despite ongoing security concerns in the area, the head of the PEC in North Sinai tells MBC Masr satellite channel.

The PEC official said that the vote count in North Sinai is only taking place in polling centres and that ballots are not being transported to the central stations.

The ballots will be transported on Thursday morning, he said, due to travel being difficult on the roads at night.

North Sinai, which borders the besieged Gaza Strip, has been the scene of a Islamic militant insurgency since Mohamed Morsi’s ouster last summer.

The Muslim Brotherhood and its allies do not recognise the current presidential election and consider Morsi the only legitimate president.

23:55 Al-Ahram reveals the latest results from the central polling centre in South Sinai:

El-Sisi 32,138

Sabahi 1,642

Registered voters: 87,269

23:50 More results coming in from 11 polling centres in the capital, Cairo:

El-Sisi 85,640

Sabahi 2,246

23:45 Pro-Sisi celebrations have already begun in Upper Egypt's Fayoum and in Giza's Gameat Al-Dewal Al-Arabiya, according to independent media network Welad El-Balad.

His campaign members and supporters are also claiming victory on social networks.

"Congratulations to Egypt, to the Field Marshal, hard luck Mr. Hamdeen, what happened is a victory for all, we will build our country together," said Mahmoud Badr, youth representative of El-Sisi's campaign and co-founder of the Tamarod campaign – which spearheaded the protests against ousted president Mohamed Morsi last summer.

Mohamed Abou Hamed – a former MP and not just a hardcore supporter of El-Sisi but also a founder of the former army chief’s campaign – also expressed his joy via Twitter, saying "preliminary results show an overwhelming victory" for El-Sisi.

23:35 A bit of legal ping pong as the votes continue to come in. The PEC has refused an appeal that Sabahi filed against its decision to reject his legal complaint, which was submitted yesterday in objection to the PEC’s announcement that the voting process would be extended for a third day. Did you follow that? Here’s the full explanation:

Yesterday, the PEC ordered that voting be extended for a third day. This drew complaints from both Sabahi and El-Sisi’s campaigns – both of which were rejected by the PEC. Sabahi filed an appeal against the PEC’s rejection. And now the PEC has rejected Sabahi’s appeal.

The PEC justified its ruling (to reject the appeal) by stating that Sabahi was not harmed by the decision, Al-Ahram’s Arabic news website reported.

23:25 The leftist candidate Sabahi seems to not only be competing with the ex-defence minister but also with the number of spoilt ballots.

According to privately-owned MBC Masr channel, Sabahi finished third in one of Port Said's central polling stations, Al-Dawahi:

El-Sisi 36,641

Sabahi 989

Spoilt 2,015

El-Sisi took 600 of the votes while Sabahi got 20.

22:05 North Sinai – the governorate which has witnessed a rise in militant attacks against the police and army since Morsi’s ouster last summer – also seems to be backing the field marshal.

According to Al-Ahram’s Arabic news website, 394 voted for El-Sisi at Al-Midan primary school in the border town of Al-Arish, while only 18 voted for Sabahi.

In Al-Gareer school, also in Al-Arish, El-Sisi won 567 of the votes, Sabahi only 24, and 21 ballots were spoilt.

21:55 Initial vote counts show ex-defence minister Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi as being well ahead in the race.

In Mohamed Morsi's hometown – the town of Adwa in the Nile Delta's Sharqiya – El-Sisi reportedly garnered 798 votes while Sabahi took only 67.

In Kafr El-Basha, another village in Sharqiya, El-Sisi won 1,289 of the votes, according to Al-Ahram’s Arabic news website, while Sabahi only got 14.

In another polling station in Upper Egypt's Beni Suef, only 5 votes were in favour of Sabahi while 315 went to El-Sisi.

21:40 Despite fears of a low turnout, judicial sources from the PEC have told Al-Ahram’s Arabic news website that around 21 million voters have turned up to cast their ballots – about 40 percent of the country's 54 million registered voters.

21:30 And the predictions are already coming in. An exit poll from the Egyptian Centre for Public Opinion Research (Baseera), commissioned by private satellite channel MBC Misr, puts former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi firmly in the lead, with 95.3 percent of the votes – as compared to his rival, Hamdeen Sabahi, who secured only 4.7 percent.

Voter turnout was at 47 percent, according to the poll.

Baseera was granted permission to hold the exit poll from the Presidential Elections Commission (PEC), the judicial body supervising the election.

21:20 Vote-counting has already started across Egypt, around 20 minutes after polling centres were scheduled to close.

-----

An estimated 14,000 polling centres nationwide have closed their doors, bringing the country closer to the announcement of its first president since the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi last summer.

Despite refusal by the campaigns of both presidential candidates Hamdeen Sabahi and Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, the voting process which was initially slated to only last for two days – Monday and Tuesday – was extended for a third day, a decision that according to many was influenced by fears of a low turnout.

Stay with Ahram Online through the night as we bring you blow-by-blow, station-by-station coverage as the results come in.
