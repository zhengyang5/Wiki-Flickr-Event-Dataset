Former military chief Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi became the first presidential hopeful to submit his official documents for candidacy on Monday.
Other documents required from presidential candidates include criminal records, educational qualification documentation, financial disclosure and a receipt showing payment of an EGP 20,000 insurance deposit to the Presidential Elections Commission (PEC), as dictated by the newly passed presidential elections law.
The first round of presidential elections is scheduled to take place on 26 and 27 May.
The presidential elections law stipulates that the PEC must announce the names of the candidates within two days of the closing date for nominations, also detailing of any of those who applied had been disqualified.
Presidential candidates must be at least 40 years old on the day the door for candidates opens and have never held the citizenship of another country.
