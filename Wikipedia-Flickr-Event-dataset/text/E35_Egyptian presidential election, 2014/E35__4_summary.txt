Field Marshal Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi resigned from the military on Wednesday and announced that he was determined to run in Egypt's upcoming presidential elections, slated to begin 30 March.
"My determination to run in the election does not bar others from their right to run.
Speculation around his running intensified after SCAF issued a statement in January, empowering El-Sisi to run for president.
Presidential hopefuls in this year's elections — Egypt's second since the January 2011 uprising — will be able to apply for candidacy with the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC) on 30 March, according to predictions.
According to Mansour, a new Egyptian president will be named before 17 July.
