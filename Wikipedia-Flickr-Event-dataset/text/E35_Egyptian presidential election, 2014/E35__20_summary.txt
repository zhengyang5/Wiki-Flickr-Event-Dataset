Nasserist politician Hamdeen Sabbahi will contest the upcoming presidential elections despite criticising a new law that rules out appeals on poll results.
Sabbahi’s official presidential campaign announced on Thursday that the politician would contest the election, slated for the spring.
The campaign said that while preparing for the elections, the campaign would also fight “politically and judicially” against an "unconstitutional" article in the newly issued law aimed at regulating presidential elections.
Article 7 of the law, issued by President Adly Mansour last week, states that candidates cannot file court appeals against the election results.
The campaign described the article as threatening to the stability of the country and the political system as a whole.
