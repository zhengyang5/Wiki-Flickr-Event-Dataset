Protesters in Hong Kong share a common goal of getting Beijing to agree to free elections for the Hong Kong government’s top job in 2017 (at the moment, Beijing is insisting on screening candidates).
Yet leaderlessness has not stopped Hong Kong demonstrators from achieving social consensus at their biggest protest site in skyscraper-hemmed Harcourt Road (or Umbrella Square, as the protesters now call it).
“It’s maybe the not so good thing about these protests,” he says, “but it’s also the most beautiful thing.”Over the past few days, Harcourt Road has acquired suburbs of camping tents.
A letter was recently delivered by the Hong Kong Post Office to tent 22, according to the Democratic Party’s Facebook page.
Meanwhile, supply tents — there are several around Harcourt Road — have become bursting emporiums of water, towels, face masks, Oreo cookies and McDonalds takeout.
