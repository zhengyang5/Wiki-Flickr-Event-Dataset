A pro-democracy protester protects himself from tear gas in Hong Kong during a demonstration yesterday.
Protests continue as Hong Kong democracy supporters fill the streets after days of protesting.
The use of tear gas and pepper spray has not deterred demonstrators as thousands more have joined in and are now occupying Causeway Bay, Mongkok and Admiralty.
After tear gas was unleashed on the protesters last night, protesters chose to use umbrellas to protect themselves.
