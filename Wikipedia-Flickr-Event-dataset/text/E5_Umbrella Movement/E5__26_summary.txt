But while some vow to step up confrontations with police, protest leaders are planning a strategic retreat.
If student leaders do not change their strategy and distance themselves from a radical minority of protesters who insist on violent escalation, they risk widespread condemnation.
The student leaders of the protests had initially responded to calls for retreat with defiance.
Yet student leaders have announced they too are now considering a retreat.
The Hong Kong Federation of Students told reporters Thursday they would make a decision within a week on whether to evacuate the remaining protest sites.
