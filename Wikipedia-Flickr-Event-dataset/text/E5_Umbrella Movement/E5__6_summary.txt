The eyes of the world are on Hong Kong this week, as unrelenting images of the clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police continue to emerge.
The movement has been dubbed the "Umbrella Revolution", characterised as it is by the striking scenes of brightly coloured brollies being used to create shield walls against riot police.
