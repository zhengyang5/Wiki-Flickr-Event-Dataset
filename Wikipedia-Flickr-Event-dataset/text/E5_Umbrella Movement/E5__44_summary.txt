Police say more arrests could be made of those who use the internet to incite others to join the "unlawful" Occupy protests.
This is understood to be the first such arrest since the Occupy Central movement began on September 28.
Eric Cheung Tat-ming, a solicitor and principal lecturer at the University of Hong Kong law faculty, said there was legal basis for such an arrest but it depended on how clear the criminal intent was.
"The legal weighing of what you say online and what you say in real life is pretty much the same," he said.
In a similar case, a man was arrested in 2010 for posting a message on an online forum about bombing the central government's liaison office.
