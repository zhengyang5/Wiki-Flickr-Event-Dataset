Demonstrators have occupied parts of Hong Kong for more than two weeks.
The activists, a mix of students and a pro-democracy group called Occupy Central, are demanding a fully democratic election in 2017.
China, which has control over Hong Kong, says residents can vote - but it will vet which candidates are eligible to stand.
Over the weekend, Hong Kong's embattled leader CY Leung said the protestors had zero chance of changing Beijing's mind on constitutional reform.
