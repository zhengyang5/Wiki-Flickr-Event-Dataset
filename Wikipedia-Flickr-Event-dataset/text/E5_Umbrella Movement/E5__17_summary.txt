HONG KONG—So far in the Hong Kong protests, the territory’s chief executive, CY Leung, has seemed inept at best.
“If you don’t respond to the demand of the Hong Kong people, we will paralyze the government,” said Alex Chow (paywall), head of the Hong Kong Federation of Students.
When at last Leung’s speech was broadcast over a megaphone, the crowd hushed each other to listen.

Scores of demonstrators began sitting in protest, while others spilled out onto the major throughway linking Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, on the mainland, blocking traffic.
