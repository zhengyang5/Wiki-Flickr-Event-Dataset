The work, which he calls “the Spirit of Lion Rock”, drew a crowd almost as soon as it was unveiled in Admiralty.

“Some people took pictures, some people made paintings, but no one has made a replica of Lion Rock, so I decided to do what I do best.”Many in the city associate the “Lion Rock spirit” with striving for a better life - as embodied in 1970s RTHK drama Under the Lion Rock and its title song.
