Many Hong Kong residents expressed anger and frustration at police handling of the unrest, with some accusing security forces of co-operating with criminal gangs, failing to make arrests and helping some attackers to exit the scene quickly.
“We condemn the violence used against Hong Kong civilians yesterday,” said student leader Joshua Wong.
Hong Kong leader Leung has said the use of PLA soldiers would not be necessary.
But Amnesty International issued a statement criticising them for “(failing) in their duty to protect hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy protesters from attacks by counter demonstrators”.
