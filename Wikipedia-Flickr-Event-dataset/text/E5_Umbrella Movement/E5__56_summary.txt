A band of Hong Kong art guardians are on constant standby at the city’s sprawling protest site.
“Their job is to call me,” says Meaghan McGurgan, who runs a theatre blog and founded the Umbrella Movement Art Preservation group.
Much of the art at a secondary protest site in the working-class neighbourhood of Mongkok was destroyed in recent clashes with officers.
For pieces such as “Umbrella Man” that task will hopefully be relatively simple: get in, grab the statue, and get out.
Local artist Kacey Wong says the democracy movement’s protest art needs to be preserved for future generations.
