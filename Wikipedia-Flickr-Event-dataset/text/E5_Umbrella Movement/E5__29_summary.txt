An injured student protester is escorted by local police out of the protest area in Kowloon's crowded Mong Kok district on Friday.
The episode marks a grim moment in what's been a historic week in Hong Kong politics.
For days, the demonstrators had staged peaceful sit-ins around government sites, calling for the resignation of Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, and the promotion of genuine democratic reforms.
Anger has boiled over into violence in Hong Kong, with hundreds of pro-government supporters attacking protesters occupying the city's business district.
According to the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's main English language daily, the anti-occupy crowd appeared, at least initially, to have been directed by a women shouting into a megaphone in Mandarin Chinese.
