In a city unused to political violence, many people in Hong Kong were shocked by what they saw as a harsh response by police officers who used tear gas, batons and pepper spray against pro-democracy demonstrators on Sunday.
Videos and other images tell the story of Occupy Central, as the movement is called, whose participants want Hong Kong people to be allowed to freely choose the candidates in the 2017 election for the next leader, a request that China’s central government in Beijing has turned down.

A characteristic of the protests so far has been the use by demonstrators of umbrellas, to protect against police use of pepper spray.
This post on Twitter shows some umbrellas in a subway exit and suggests a name for the movement: the Umbrella Revolution.
