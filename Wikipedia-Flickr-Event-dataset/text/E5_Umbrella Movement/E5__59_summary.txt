Hong Kong police arrested 12 people after brief clashes with protesters in Mong Kok between Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, as a large crowd carrying yellow-coloured accessories gathered and chanted slogans demanding true universal suffrage.
Earlier on Wednesday evening, pro-democracy activists kicked off Christmas rallies on the eve of the Chief Executive's trip to Beijing on Thursday.
As the mobile demonstration lasted into the early hours of Christmas Day, several protesters were handcuffed and taken away.
Last-minute Christmas shoppers momentarily got tangled among the protesters escorted by police through Pacific Place along the bridge and under the Queensway Plaza.
"This is a great way to spend your Christmas rather than going for a [family meal] or shopping," she added.
