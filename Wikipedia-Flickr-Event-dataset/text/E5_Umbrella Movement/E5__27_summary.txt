On Wednesday, police detained two prominent Hong Kong student leaders and 167 other protesters.
Joshua Wong, 18, and Lester Shum, 21, were among the crowds gathered in Mong Kok, a bustling commercial district across the harbor from Hong Kong island.

The protesters are angry, moreover, at the ruling establishment within Hong Kong, a coterie of political and business elites who critics say are in bed with Beijing to the detriment of the larger Hong Kong population.
Shum's calm and composure are a stirring testament to the defiance of Hong Kong's young people.
