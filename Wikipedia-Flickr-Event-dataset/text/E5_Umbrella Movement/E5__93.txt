Story highlights Hong Kong protest leaders are appealing their prison terms

The city's highest court will hear their case on November 7

Hong Kong (CNN) Two leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement jailed in August have been released on bail.

A court ordered Joshua Wong and Nathan Law be freed Tuesday while they appeal their prison terms, their political party, Demisisto, confirmed.

Speaking outside court alongside Wong, Law said "for now there's a lot uncertainty." Their appeal will be heard next month.

Wong said the pair's time in prison was "a chance for us to strengthen our determination to fight for democracy."

"The government can lock up our bodies but they cannot lock up our minds," he added.

Pro-democracy activist Nathan Law leaves Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal on Tuesday.
