— After a fresh outbreak of violence between Hong Kong police and pro-democracy demonstrators, a Hong Kong court granted an injunction Monday that could set in motion a bid by authorities to clear parts of the main protest site.
At least 58 people, including 11 police officers, were injured during the clashes Sunday night and Monday morning, according to Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority.
Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement represents the biggest challenge to Beijing’s authority since the territory reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.
“We encourage differences between Hong Kong authorities and protesters to be addressed peacefully through dialogue,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.
The Hong Kong protests had drawn tens of thousands daily since beginning in late September.
