Hong Kong police announced Thursday that they had detained 12 pro-democracy protesters after a night of clashes when nearly 100 demonstrators took to the streets Wednesday, marking the first sizeable rally since the last Occupy Central protest camp was cleared by authorities last week, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
During Wednesday’s rally, protesters also walked to the city’s government headquarters in an attempt to signal that the democracy movement was not over.
“There is one thing that I am certain of and that is the movement had never ended in our hearts,” one of the protesters told AFP.
“I think the occupation of the streets will end today, but the movement will still be here,” a protester told International Business Times.
Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping said last week that the people of Macau -- which is a special administrative region of China, like Hong Kong -- should respect the “one country, two systems” principle, a comment that many considered to be aimed at pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
