Police in Hong Kong have arrested four men after a small group of pro-democracy protesters wielded metal barricades and concrete slabs as they tried to force their way into the city’s legislature.
But while Occupy Central and student groups initiated the protests in late September, the “umbrella movement” has taken on a momentum of its own.
At the height of the protest movement more than 100,000 took to the streets in support.
Occupiers have called for the resignation of Hong Kong’s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, and open nominations for his successor.
Hong Kong enjoys considerable autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework.
