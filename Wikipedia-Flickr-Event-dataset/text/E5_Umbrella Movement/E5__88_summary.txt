Thirteen Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters convicted of unlawful assembly were jailed for between eight and 13 months by an appeal court on Tuesday after prosecutors pushed for tougher sentences.
Protesters and villagers – some of whom would lose their homes if the plan went ahead – sat peacefully outside the building.
Who are the 13 protesters?
The others are from a tertiary student group or those protesters who turned up individually.
The three justices at the appeal court agreed and sentenced the 13 to eight to 13 months in jail instead.
