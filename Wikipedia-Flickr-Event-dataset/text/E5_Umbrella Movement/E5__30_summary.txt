HONG KONG—Across Victoria Harbor in Mong Kok, Hong Kong’s Umbrella Movement is quite literally divided.
Mong Kok, a working class neighborhood that feels a world away from the city’s financial center on Hong Kong island, has become one of the movement’s most resilient protest sites.
Disagreement between student groups and Occupy Central, which is led by a Hong Kong university academic, have been apparent almost since the protests started.
This week, protesters wearing Guy Fawkes masks clashed with police in Mong Kok, the first escalation in more than two weeks.
You realize you did your best and the government still hasn’t changed,” the protester in Mong Kok says.
