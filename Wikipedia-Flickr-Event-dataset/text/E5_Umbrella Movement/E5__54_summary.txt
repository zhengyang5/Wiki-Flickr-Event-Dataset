A group of rock climbers hung a huge yellow banner - reading "I want real universal suffrage" - from the highest point of Lion Rock yesterday to show support for the democracy movement.
"Today we are occupying Lion Rock," a man dressed as Spiderman says on camera.
"We think the spirit of Lion Rock isn't just about money.
This kind of fighting against injustice, strength in the face of troubles, is the true Lion Rock spirit."
Many in the city associate the "Lion Rock spirit" with striving for a better life - as embodied in 1970s RTHK drama Under the Lion Rock and its title song.
