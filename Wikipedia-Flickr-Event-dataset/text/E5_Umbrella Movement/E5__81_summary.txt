A 14-year-old Hong Kong girl arrested for scribbling graffiti on a wall famous for the pro-democracy messages it carried has been sent to a children’s home.
Notes and messages have sporadically been posted on the wall since the protest sites were cleared by police earlier in December.
The teenager was arrested in the early hours of December 23 after scrawling on the wall and was detained for 17 hours, said solicitor Patricia Ho.
But neither the girl nor her father wanted her to be removed, Ho said.
“She was very upset and said she was afraid of going into the home” in a statement to the court, said Ho.
