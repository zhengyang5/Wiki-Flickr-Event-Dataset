When Hong Kong police fired the first round of tear gas at pro-democracy protesters on September 28, the head of Occupy Central’s marshal team, Alex Kwok Siu-kit, was not panicked.
Kwok leads a team run by the Occupy Central group, one of the main organisers of the protests which have been primarily led by student groups.
The result is that those protesters refuse to listen to instructions from the 50-strong group of marshals, and sometimes argue with them.

Training for the Occupy Central marshals started about a year ago.
