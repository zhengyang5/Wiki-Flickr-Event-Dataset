Update: 15:39, 16 November 2014 SundayReport claims more HK protesters now banned from ChinaWorld Bulletin/News DeskThe day after student protest leaders were informed their permits to travel to mainland China had been canceled, a report claims that more than 500 students and other activists have been similarly blacklisted.
The trio had been instrumental in a campaign that has seen thousands take to the streets to call for genuine universal suffrage for the 2017 chief executive election.
Nathan Law, one of the three student leaders, told The Anadolu Agency Sunday that he was “very sad” to discover that his home-return permit had been canceled.
Movement founder Joshua Wong said that tension between the protesters and the government would rise if the administration ignored the matter.
He added it was not right for protesters to violate court orders as it would undermine the rule of law.
