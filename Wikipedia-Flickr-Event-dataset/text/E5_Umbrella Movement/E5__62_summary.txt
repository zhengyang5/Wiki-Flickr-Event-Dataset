CY Leung: Occupy Hong Kong Movement 'Jeopardized' Rule of LawCY Leung Occupy Hong Kong Movement 'Jeopardized' Rule of Law, hong kong chief executive, universal suffrageHong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung said that last year's Occupy Movement not only didn't help in the cause for universal suffrage, but it "jeopardized the rule of law as well as our society's core values."
He insisted that it was unrealistic to restart the constitutional reform process, and says lawmakers in Hong Kong need to understand that.
Despite Leung's pleas, several lawmakers in Hong Kong reportedly plan to boycott the vote, or oppose it all together.
Leung also said he hopes to appeal to the youth of Hong Kong by having face-to-face talks with them, reported CRI.
The Occupy Hong Kong movement began in September after the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) announced that it wouldn't allow civil nominations.
