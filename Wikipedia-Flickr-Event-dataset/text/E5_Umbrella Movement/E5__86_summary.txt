The ruling against Joshua Wong Chi-fung, Nathan Law Kwun-chung and Alex Chow Yong-kang effectively halted their budding political careers, as they were slapped with a five-year ban from public office because of their criminal records.
All three indicated they would take their case to the Court of Final Appeal.
The court previously heard Wong and Chow had climbed into the government compound, while Law incited others to follow suit.
What they did was to improve Hong Kong.”Supporters waiting outside the court chanted “civil disobedience”, while others called out “shame on the judges”.
People who hold such views not only break the law in conduct, but despise and transcend the law in spirit.”
