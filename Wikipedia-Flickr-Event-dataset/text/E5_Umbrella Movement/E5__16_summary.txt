Police have banned two Chinese pro-democracy activists from Brisbane's G20 security zones - virtually the city's entire CBD - after they unfurled a protest banner near the Chinese president's hotel.
Mr Wai said they would have just left the area if they had been asked.
They wanted the Chinese president to 'see our protest', which they thought would last longer than it did.
Mr Zhang said Australian police were more understanding and willing to listen than those in China.
In an interview with the ABC on Thursday evening, Mr Newman said the government just wanted people to protest peacefully.
