The unpopular Beijing backed leader of Hong Kong, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, has urged people to leave the protests, which were declared “illegal” by China.
“We don't want Hong Kong to be messy,” he said in a statement broadcast on Monday.
Demonstrations are being run by a group called Occupy Central with Love and Peace, which describes itself as a “non-violent direct action movement that demands a fully democratic government in Hong Kong”.
