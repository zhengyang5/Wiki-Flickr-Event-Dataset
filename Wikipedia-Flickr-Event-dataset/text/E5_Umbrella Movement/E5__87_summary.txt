A Hong Kong court sent young activist Joshua Wong and two other student leaders to prison Thursday for their roles in the pro-democracy "Umbrella Movement", in the latest sign that tolerance for dissent is waning in the former British colony.
We want democracy in Hong Kong.
Wong and Law were originally given community service and Chow had received a suspended three-week prison sentence.
"Time is on our side and one day Hong Kong will be a place we can determine our own future.
We love Hong Kong," he said into a microphone as a rival, pro-Beijing protester chanted, also on a microphone, nearby.
