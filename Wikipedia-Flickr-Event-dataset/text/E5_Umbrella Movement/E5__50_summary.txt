PhotoThe pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have a new mascot: a roughly 12-foot-high figure of wood blocks holding a bright yellow umbrella in its outstretched right hand.
The students call it Umbrella Man.
The statue’s main creator, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, transported it to the protest in a van and carefully moved it into position on the wide avenue in front of the Hong Kong government’s headquarters.
Milk said that he was an only child who had spent his entire life in Hong Kong and had studied videography in college.
Milk explained apologetically that the statue had been slightly damaged in the van on the way to the protest site.
