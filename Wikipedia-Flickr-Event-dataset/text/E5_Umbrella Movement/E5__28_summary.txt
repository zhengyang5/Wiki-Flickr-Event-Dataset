As protesters streamed into the site Alex Chow -- president of leading protest group the Hong Kong Federation of Students -- said he would seek a meeting with China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang if the Hong Kong government failed to relay protesters' demands to mainland authorities.
Parts of the semi-autonomous Chinese city, an Asian financial hub, have been paralysed by a month of mass rallies and roadblocks.
"If the Hong Kong government has difficulty meeting our demands, we sincerely hope that arrangements could be made for us to directly meet with premier Li Keqiang as soon as possible," Chow said.
On June 3/4 the movement was brutally crushed by the military, with hundreds -- and by some estimates thousands -- killed.
Protest leaders are also aware that the disruption caused by their roadblocks has sparked mounting public frustration.
