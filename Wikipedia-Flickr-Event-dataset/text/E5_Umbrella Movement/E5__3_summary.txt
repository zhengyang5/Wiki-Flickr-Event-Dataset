The pro-Beijing press here is running an unrelenting campaign against the Occupy movement, accusing Chan and Occupy co-founders Benny Tai and Rev.
Chan is just one of many pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong to suffer harassment because of a pursuit for greater political freedom.
Other leaders of the Occupy movement have also been targeted, the Monitor has found.
“What happens to Chinese activists is now being replicated in Hong Kong, we’re now facing the same thing,” Chan says.
“Without democracy and rule of law, human rights in Hong Kong will inevitably be eroded,” Mr. Teng says.
