HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters have created a self-sustaining village within a month of taking their call for democracy to the streets, setting up changing rooms, tents for hire, a study area, first-aid stations and even their own security patrols as they ready for the long haul.
And when rain pounds the village, which straddles a major thoroughfare in the heart of Hong Kong, dozens set to work.
"When it started to rain, over a dozen people made a cover over the study area within 15 minutes."
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" formula that allows it wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms and specifies universal suffrage for choosing its leader as an ultimate goal.
