Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement appears to fracturing, days before a court decision that is expected to usher in the clearing of the main site where protesters have been camped out for months.
The three leaders of Occupy Central with Love and Peace, Hong Kong’s long-time pro-democracy group, said Dec. 2 they plan to surrender Dec. 3 to Hong Kong police, before the “out of control” cops hurt any one else, and take the rap for the entire civil disobedience movement.
“Surrendering is not an act of cowardice, it is the courage to act on a promise,” founder Benny Tai said.
“To surrender is not to fail, it is a silent denunciation of a heartless government.” The group urged students to retreat.
Joshua Wong, leader of the student group Scholarism, and two other students said late on Dec. 1 that they would fast until Hong Kong’s chief executive CY Leung agrees to restart a discussion on democratic reforms.
