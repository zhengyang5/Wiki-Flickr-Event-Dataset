Romania's presidential runoff sees Prime Minister Victor Ponta facing off against Klaus Iohannis, the ethnic German mayor of the Transylvanian city of Sibiu.
Critics say as president Ponta could grant an amnesty to political allies imprisoned for corruption, and that his party would have far too much power.
"Civilized" IohannisIn an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, the ethnic German mayor proudly said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has written him a letter wishing him success in the runoff.
"Ponta is a candidate of the system, a candidate who is manipulated by local (political) barons," the mayor told the AP.
Ponta supporters dumped dozens of hens — some dead — inside Iohannis' party headquarters, calling him a coward.
