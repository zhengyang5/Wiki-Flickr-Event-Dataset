Local television Realitatea TV showed Sova saying he "would not comment for the moment" and Hrebenciuc saying "I just took note" of the investigation.
The prosecutors were already investigating another case involving Hrebenciuc, related to recovering forest land seized under the communist dictatorship.
These officials were accused of supporting an organised crime group in a case where roughly 43,000 hectares (430 sq km) of forest land was illegally granted to third parties in 2012.
On Monday, prosecutors said the two lawmakers, Sova and Hrebenciuc, had allegedly "discussed in detail" accusations brought against Hrebenciuc in the forest land investigation, and about "the risk of (Hrebenciuc) being convicted."
Romania ranks behind only Greece and Bulgaria in perceptions of corruption in the 28-nation EU, according to Transparency International.
