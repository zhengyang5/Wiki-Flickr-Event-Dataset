Romanian foreign minister resigns in election rowBy Radu-Sorin MarinasBUCHAREST, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Romanian Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean resigned on Monday after thousands of people rallied at the weekend in support of compatriots abroad who were turned away as they tried to vote in the first round of a presidential election.
Ponta told reporters on Monday he had accepted Corlatean's resignation and had appointed former foreign intelligence head Teodor Melescanu, a veteran politician, as interim foreign minister.
"First discussions will be at the electoral bureau to find out what can be done and which are the ways to ensure voting participation (abroad)," Ponta said.
"I cannot give reasons for contesting the outcome of the presidential election runoff on grounds of noncompliance with the law, abroad," Corlatean told a news briefing.
"The Foreign Ministry fully keeps its stance that there's no legal basis to up the number of polling stations abroad," Corlatean said on Monday.
