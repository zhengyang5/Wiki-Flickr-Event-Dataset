Romanians are voting in an election that’s set to propel Prime Minister Victor Ponta toward the presidency after he batted away corruption investigations of members of his party and allegations he’s a former spy.
That would set up a runoff between the two on Nov. 16, which Ponta would win, according to the surveys.
To voters, Ponta’s vows to boost living standards and pensions trump the scandals, according to the Institute for Public Policies in Bucharest.
An Oct. 2-8 survey of 1,058 people by INSCOP showed a 10-point advantage for Ponta over Johannis.
A Ponta victory would guarantee “a degree of continuity in policy making,” according to Pasquale Diana, an economist at Morgan Stanley in London.
