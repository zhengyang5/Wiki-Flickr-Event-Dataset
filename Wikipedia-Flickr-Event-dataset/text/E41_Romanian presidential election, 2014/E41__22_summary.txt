Victor Ponta the Romanian Prime Minister, conceded defeat in Romania's presidential race on Sunday after exit polls showed centre-right candidate Klaus Iohannis had staged a surprising comeback against the frontrunner.
But the predictions proved wrong and Mr Ponta phoned Iohannis to congratulate his opponent well before then.
But despite the loss, he ruled out quitting as prime minister and said his Social Democrat alliance would remain in power until parliamentary elections due in 2016.
Prime minister since 2012, the 42-year-old Ponta often feuded with his rival, outgoing President Traian Basescu, which stymied policymaking and caused a constitutional crisis.
But Iohannis as president will, like Basescu, face a hostile parliamentary majority that could cause more policy wrangling.
