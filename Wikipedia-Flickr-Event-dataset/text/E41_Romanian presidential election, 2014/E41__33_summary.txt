Romanians who live and work abroad had to queue to vote yesterday (Sunday, November 2), and many protested as some voting sections closed earlier, or were unable to cater to everyone who wanted to vote, according to Mediafax.
Romanians in London, Paris, and even in the neighboring Republic of Moldova’s capital Chisinau formed queues starting early in the morning yesterday, to cast their vote in the presidential elections.
Five polls were opened in Germany, but Romanians there complained they were unable to vote because of the poor organization.
The vote abroad took longer as Romanians had to fill in a statement saying they have not voted elsewhere already.
