Sibiu mayor Klaus Iohannis is to be the new President of Romania after Sunday's run-off, according to partial official results.
Exit polls had suggested Iohannis, an ethnic German, and Prime Minister Victor Ponta were running neck and neck.
Right-leaning Iohannis has garnered about 55.79 percent, Romanian election announced after an unusual delay.
Iohannis, whose candidacy was raised by the Christian Liberal Alliance, called on Ponta to step down as PM after the vote, but the latter refused to do so.
The election winner reiterated that Ponta is the main culprit for the situation with the expat vote.
