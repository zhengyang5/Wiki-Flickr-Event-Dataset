BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania’s outgoing President Traian Basescu has accused his bitter rival and likely successor, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, of serving as an undercover intelligence officer between 1997 and 2001.
Victor Ponta, Romania's Prime Minister and leader of Social Democrat ruling party, addresses his supporters during a rally at the National Arena stadium in Bucharest September 20, 2014.
“Victor Ponta must admit that he was an undercover officer of SIE (Romania’s Foreign Intelligence Service), between 1997 and 2001,” Basescu told private television channel Realitatea late on Monday.
Teodor Melescanu, who ran the Foreign Intelligence Service, resigned in September and joined the presidential race as an independent candidate one day later.
The office of president is largely ceremonial but would give Ponta considerable power at key moments, including appointing a new prime minister.
