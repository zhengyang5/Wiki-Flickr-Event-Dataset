Mr. Iohannis, 55, an ethnic German, ran what many considered a lackluster campaign.
It was estimated that around 62 percent voted this time, which according to Mr. Ghinea was the highest turnout in the last three presidential elections.
Mr. Iohannis has vowed to make corruption a priority.
Some had feared those efforts would be hindered if Mr. Ponta won.
“I see a difficult cohabitation between Ponta and Iohannis going forward,” Mr. Ghinea said.
