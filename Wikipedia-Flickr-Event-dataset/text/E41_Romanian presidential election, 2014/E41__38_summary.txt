Ponta conceded defeat in a televised speech from Bucharest in which he congratulated Johannis even as exit polls showed the race too close to call.
He lost his lead from two weeks ago, when he won the election’s first round with 40.4% of the votes compared with 30.4% for Johannis.
Several thousand people took to the streets in Bucharest and other cities to protest long lines at voting centers abroad.
Police fired tear gas in Turin to disperse Romanians angry that they weren’t able to vote before polls closed, according to Realitatea TV.
“I’m waiting for a miracle, not just a change,” said Sandu Constantin, a 42-year-old public servant, after casting his vote in Bucharest.
