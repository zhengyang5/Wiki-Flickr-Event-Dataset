Hundreds of Romanians abroad faced humiliation on Sunday as they had to wait in long queues at voting stations in many cities across Europe in an attempt to cast their ballots in the presidential elections.
Unprecedentedly bad organisation saw many of them incapable of voting after waiting for hours.
The responsibility for the organisation of voting abroad belonged to Romania's Foreign Ministry according to the law regulating presidential elections.
Other candidates called major irregularities about the situation abroad.
Exit polls - not counting votes abroad and votes in late evening back home - showed a difference of 6 to 10 percentage points between the two, with Iohannis hoping to narrow the gap to about 3-5 percent.
