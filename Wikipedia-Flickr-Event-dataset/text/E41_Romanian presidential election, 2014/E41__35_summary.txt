‘Unfortunately, the way the elections took place in the Romanian missions abroad where voting polls were organised confirms my worries.
By comparison to the latest presidential elections of 2009, the number of voting polls was reduced drastically.
At the same time, the available capacities in the voting polls were not adapted to the existing situation’ Gunther Krichbaum, the chairman of the Commission for European Affairs in Bundestag says in a letter sent on Monday to the chairman of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, Mediafax informs.
Seeing how long they should wait, many gave up queuing to express their vote’ Krichbaum adding that he saw personally all these issues in a polling station in Stuttgart.
The voting polls under the supervision of the social-democrat government in Romania received clear indications from Bucharest to hinder the votes expressed massively in favour of the candidates of the centre-right.
