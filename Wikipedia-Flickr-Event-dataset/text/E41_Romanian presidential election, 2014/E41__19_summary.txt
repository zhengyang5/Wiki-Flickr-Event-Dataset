BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Thousands of Romanians joined anti-government protests in a number of cities on Friday to demand fair elections, two days ahead of a presidential run-off vote that has been overshadowed by complaints of poor organization of the ballot overseas.
Long queues and bureaucratic hurdles made the voting process lengthy at Romanian embassies across the European Union and elsewhere in the first round.
The government has taken measures to ensure the Nov. 16 vote runs smoothly, increasing the number of voting booths and staff abroad.
Leftist Prime Minister Victor Ponta is widely expected to win Sundayâ€™s runoff against an ethnic German mayor backed by two centre-right parties.
Overall, Ponta, a former prosecutor and amateur rally driver, won 40.4 percent of the first round vote, 10 points ahead of Iohannis.
