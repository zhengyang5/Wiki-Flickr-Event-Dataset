Romanians who live and work abroad had to queue to vote yesterday (Sunday, November 2), and many protested as some voting sections closed earlier, or were unable to cater to everyone who wanted to vote, according to Mediafax.

Romanians in London, Paris, and even in the neighboring Republic of Moldova’s capital Chisinau formed queues starting early in the morning yesterday, to cast their vote in the presidential elections.

In Paris at the Romanian Embassy, special troops had to intervene, as many Romanians forced their entry into the Embassy, hoping to be able to finally vote.

In London, over 1,000 people were not able to vote, after queuing for the whole day. Five polls were opened in Germany, but Romanians there complained they were unable to vote because of the poor organization. Romanians had to queue in Vienna, as well as in Rome, Turin and Bologna, and some of them managed to vote after several hours of waiting. The vote abroad took longer as Romanians had to fill in a statement saying they have not voted elsewhere already.
