Fire at nuclear power plant extinguishedA FIRE that had broken out at a nuclear plant after the devastating earthquake in northeast Japan was extinguished early this morning.
A fire broke out at the plant following the quake, the Kyodo news agency said.
Separately, Fukushima prefecture, the site of a Tokyo Electric Power nuclear power plant, said the plant's reactor cooling system was functioning, denying an earlier report that it was malfunctioning.
Earlier, the International Atomic Energy Agency said four Japanese nuclear power plants closest to the epicentre of the quake had been safely shut down.
The agency is seeking further information on which countries and nuclear facilities may be affected."
