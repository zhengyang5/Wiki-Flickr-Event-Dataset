— Flanked by Tokyo Bay and greenery, Urayasu has long been a popular home for young families.
The damage from liquefaction will cost the city about ¥73.4 billion, including restoring sewerage systems, waterworks and roads.
Urayasu Mayor Hideki Matsuzaki has been refusing to let the city take part in Sunday’s election, saying the staff can’t be spared to handle and count ballots because officials are too busy dealing with liquefaction damage.
Three candidates filed to run for two seats representing Urayasu, but it is likely there will be no voting Sunday.
But she quickly learned about the liquefaction in Urayasu on Twitter, she said.
