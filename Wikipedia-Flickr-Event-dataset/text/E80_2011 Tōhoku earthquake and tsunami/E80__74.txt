TOKYO, April 4 (KUNA) -- A tsunami that hit a coastal city in northern Japan after the March 11 massive earthquake is estimated to have reached 37.9 meters in height, a field survey showed, Kyodo News Agency reported.

The tsunami measured in a district in Miyako City, 480 km north of Tokyo, was higher than the domestic record of 38.2 meters marked in 1896, Yoshinobu Tsuji, associate professor at the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo said, according to Kyodo.
