Japan quake fault may have moved 40 metres0240 GMT, 12 March 2011Michael Reilly, senior technology editorThe latest figures on the earthquake that struck Japan on Friday suggest that, despite all the headlines, it was actually surprisingly small.
By comparison, the magnitude 9.1 Sumatra earthquake in 2004 broke along an area of fault 1300 km long.
What the fault lacked in size, it made up for when the two adjoining tectonic plates slipped a whopping 40 metres.
This calculation comes from Chen Ji of the University of California, Santa Barbara (in the figure below, red colouring indicates areas of 40 metres' slip).
But his calculations suggest that an area of fault between 300 and 400 kilometres long by 100 kilometres wide slipped some 40 metres.
