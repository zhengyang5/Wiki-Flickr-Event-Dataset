Hamada used to live in the Yuriage district of Natori, Miyagi Prefecture.
He said they had driven off minutes before the first massive waves roared in, and their loss continues to haunt him.
As he was leaving the party, his mother drove up to the hall with his sister in the back seat.
He remained hospitalized for a week, and remembers spending those days wondering about the fate of his mother and sister.
After doctors discharged him, Hamada viewed the corpses of his mother and sister in a funeral parlor in Natori.
