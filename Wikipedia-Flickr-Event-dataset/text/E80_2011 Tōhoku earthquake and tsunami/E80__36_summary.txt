The massive earthquake that struck northeast Japan Friday (March 11) has shortened the length Earth's day by a fraction and shifted how the planet's mass is distributed.

Major temblors have shortened day length in the past.
And the impact from Japan's 8.9-magnitude temblor may not be completely over.The weaker aftershocks may contribute tiny changes to day length as well.
"In theory, anything that redistributes the Earth's mass will change the Earth's rotation," Gross said.
