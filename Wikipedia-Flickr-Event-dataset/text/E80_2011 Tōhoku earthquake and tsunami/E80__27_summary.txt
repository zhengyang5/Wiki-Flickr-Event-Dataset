Japan’s meteorological agency said the quake was an aftershock of the magnitude-9.0 earthquake and tsunami that struck the same area in 2011, killing about 19,000 people and devastating the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant.
Japan’s meteorological agency issued a 1-metre tsunami advisory for a long stretch of Japan’s northeastern coast, and it put the quake’s magnitude at 7.1.
All but two of Japan’s 50 nuclear reactors have been offline since a March 2011 earthquake and ensuing tsunami triggered multiple meltdowns and massive radiation leaks at the Fukushima plant, about 250 kilometres northeast of Tokyo.
A string of mishaps this year at the Fukushima plant has raised international concerns about the operator’s ability to tackle the continuing crisis.
