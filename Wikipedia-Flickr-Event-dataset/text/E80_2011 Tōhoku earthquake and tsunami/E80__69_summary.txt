â€” Shortly after the magnitude 9.0 quake hit the Tohoku region on March 11, Noriko Suzuki looked out of her house and saw tsunami coming.
But the unprecedented quake and tsunami impacted more than 10 prefectures and destroyed vast coastlines, Chiba being one of the southern-most hit.
When she saw the tsunami coming, she could only run toward a bamboo grove behind her house, she said.
The tsunami destroyed her furniture and she now lives with a sister elsewhere in Chiba, she said.
Evacuees at shelters say they go back and check on their homes to prevent looting, which happens despite daily police patrols in the affected areas, they say.
