Friday's massive earthquake may have shifted Japan's main coastline by up to 13 feet to the east, experts tell the BBC, citing the country's network of 1,200 GPS monitoring stations.

A member of the British Geological Survey said such movement was "in line with what you get when you have an earthquake this big." The Japan Meteorological Agency has raised the quake's magnitude to 9; the U.S. Geological Survey puts it at 8.9.

The GeoNet GPS network is the world's largest.

And besides losing an hour to Daylight Saving Time, your days will be permanently shorter because of the quake. It may have knocked Earth off its axis by about 6.5 inches, causing our world to rotate faster and shortening the day -- by about 1.8 millionths of a second.

Also, if you're wondering whether the quake has an official name, it does. The JMA has crowned it "The 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake."

Makes your head spin, huh?
