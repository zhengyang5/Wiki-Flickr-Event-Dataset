MOSCOW - Russian authorities on Friday evacuated some 11,000 residents from coastal areas on Pacific islands before they were hit by tsunami waves unleashed by a magnitude 8.9 earthquake off Japan's northeastern coast.
A three-meter wave reached the village of Malokurilskoye and some other villages recorded lower water levels, the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said.
The Russian State Fisheries Commmittee said that it had sent a tsunami warning to 76 fishing ships in the area, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
Authorities on the Kamchatka Peninsula further north had also expected to be hit by the tsunami but said it didn't reach the area.
Kamchatka volcanoes are part of the "Ring of Fire" string of volcanoes encircling the Pacific.
