We consider the vulnerability of nuclear power plants to a disaster like the one that occurred at Fukushima Daiichi.
Higher elevations for these variables, or waterproof protection of backup generators, could have mitigated or prevented the disaster.
We collected information on these variables, along with historical data on run-up heights, for 89 coastal nuclear power plants in the world.
Japanese plants were relatively unprotected against potential inundation in international comparison, but there was considerable variation for power plants within and outside of Japan; 2.
Older power plants and plants owned by the largest utility companies appear to have been particularly unprotected.
