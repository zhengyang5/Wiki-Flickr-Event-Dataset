The insurance cost of the quake is nearly as much as the entire worldwide catastrophe loss for the global insurance industry in 2010 and could result in higher prices in the insurance market after years of declines, according to the analysis released by Boston-based AIR Worldwide.
Total losses from the quake could range from $14.5 billion to $34.6 billion, according to the AIR analysis.

If the AIR analysis proves accurate, the Japanese earthquake would rank as the second-costliest catastrophe in modern times, adjusted for inflation, right behind Hurricane Katrina.
"It is still in the very early aftermath of the event," said Dr. Jayanta Guin, senior vice president of research and modeling at AIR Worldwide.
