Wiped off the map: The moment apocalyptic tsunami waves drown a sleepy coast townThis is the almost apocalyptic moment unstoppable tsunami waves wipe out an entire town after a massive earthquake struck off the coast of Japan today.
Hundreds of homes, workplaces and roads had lined the busy residential area of Rikuzentakata, on the north eastern coast.
The wave reaches up to ten metres high, easily drowning homes that would have been full of people shortly before.
'The earthquake has caused major damage in broad areas in northern Japan,' Prime Minister Naoto Kan said at a news conference.
The tsunami roared over embankments, washing anything in its path inland before reversing directions and carrying the cars, homes and other debris out to sea.
