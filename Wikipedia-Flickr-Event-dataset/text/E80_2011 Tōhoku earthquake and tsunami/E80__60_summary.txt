SENDAI (Kyodo) The dead and missing in the wake of Friday’s 9.0-magnitude quake and massive tsunami topped 5,000 Monday, after some 2,000 bodies were found along two shores in Miyagi Prefecture.
Police and firefighters meanwhile worked to recover another 200 to 300 bodies in Sendai, but the debris is slowing down the recovery effort.
Of the 2,000, about 1,000 were spotted on the coast at Minamisanriku, where the Miyagi Prefectural Government has been unable to ascertain the fate of about 10,000 people — over half the town’s population.
The findings point to a significantly increased death toll from the quake and tsunami.
A Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer rescued 32 people around the quay at Ishinomaki on Saturday, the Defense Ministry said separately.
