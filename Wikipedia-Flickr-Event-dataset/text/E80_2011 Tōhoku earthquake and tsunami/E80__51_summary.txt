Chile canceled tsunami warnings from the northern Atacama Desert to Antarctica after the earthquake in Japan spawned 2-meter (6.6 feet) waves along the South American country’s Pacific Ocean coast.
Chile, the world’s biggest copper-producing nation, imposed the warnings yesterday as a precaution for tsunamis triggered by the 8.9-magnitude earthquake that killed hundreds in Japan.
State copper company Codelco ordered personnel to leave its Ventanas smelter on the central coast, a company official said.
Xstrata and Anglo American Plc own the Collahuasi copper mine, the world’s third biggest, in northern Chile.
All ports used by Codelco were closed yesterday, according to a company official.
