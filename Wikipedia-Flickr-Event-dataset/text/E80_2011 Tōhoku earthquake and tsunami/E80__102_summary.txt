Body found in Oregon identified as missing tsunami victimBy BNO NewsSALEM (BNO NEWS) -- A body found along a beach in Oregon earlier this month has been positively identified as a missing U.S. tsunami victim, Oregon State Police confirmed on Tuesday.
Dustin Douglas Weber, 25, was reported missing on March 11 when he was making photographs of a tsunami near the mouth of the Klamath River in Del Norte County in California.
He reportedly wanted to make photographs of the tsunami, which was generated by a large earthquake off Japan.
Dr. Chris Young at the Medical Examiner's Office said Weber was positively identified by a forensic odontologist using dental records.
The tsunami on March 11 was the result of a 9.0-magnitude earthquake that struck off northeastern Japan, killing at least 13,200 people and leaving more than 14,300 others missing in Japan.
