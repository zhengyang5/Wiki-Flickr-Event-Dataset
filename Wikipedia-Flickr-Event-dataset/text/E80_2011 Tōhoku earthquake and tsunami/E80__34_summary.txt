Data from the country's Geonet network of around 1,200 GPS monitoring stations suggest a large displacement following the massive quake.
This would make it the joint fifth biggest quake since instrumental records began, but other agencies have not yet followed suit.
As the Pacific plate moves westwards underneath Japan, it drags the North American plate downwards and westwards with it.
"The Pacific plate has moved a maximum of 20m westwards, but the amount of movement will vary even within the fault," said Dr Musson.
Work on the array began in 1993, and it has now grown into the largest GPS network in the world, according to the GSI.
