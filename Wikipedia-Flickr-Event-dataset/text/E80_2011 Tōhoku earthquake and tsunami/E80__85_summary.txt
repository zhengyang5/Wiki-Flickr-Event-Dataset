Those in their 70s comprised the largest share of the victim total at 24.0 percent, it said.
The tally illustrates that many seniors failed to escape the disaster on time and were trapped by the tsunami.
As of April 11, out of 13,135 quake victims in the three prefectures on whom the police have completed autopsies, 12,143, or 92.5 percent, drowned, it said in a report released Tuesday.
The percentage of deaths by drowning was the highest in Miyagi at 95.7 percent, followed by 87.3 percent in Iwate and 87 percent in Fukushima.
Among 11,108 victims of 3/11 whose ages were identified, those aged 60 or older accounted for 65.2 percent.
