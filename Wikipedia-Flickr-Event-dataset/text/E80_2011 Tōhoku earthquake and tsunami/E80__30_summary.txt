The most devastating earthquake to strike Japan was in 1923, when a magnitude 7.9 tremor devastated Tokyo and Yokohama and killed an estimated 142,800 people.
The Pacific plate moves fast in tectonic terms, at a rate of 9cm (3.5 inches) a year.
As the Pacific plate moves down, it sticks to the overhead plate and pulls it down too.
The plate tectonics of the region are complex, and geologists are not sure which plate Japan sits on.
Regular aftershocks have already hit Japan as the Earth's crust continues to rupture along the Japan trench.
