In some prefectures tsunami crashed houses and cars on the roads. Huge wave has fallen on fields and roads destroying buildings. In accordance with latest information more than 50 thousand houses were partially or fully destroyed. Land and air traffic was interrupted on significant territory of the country. A few nuclear and thermal power plants were shut down. Tsunami water covered landing field of Sendai airport. The strong fires occurred at oil refineries, gas facilities and and steel works. Explosions were observed at NPP "Fukusima-1". Evacuation was started in 20 km area around nuclear power plant. No increase of radiation level was observed in Russian part of Far East. All day round monitoring of radiation is under way in this region. Kyodo News reported about 5 thousand people missing in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami. Still there is no chance to contact with 10 thousand people in Minami Sanriku town, this is half of population in this place. These people are not included in official list of missing persons. They are considered as "persons not in contact" or as "persons, whose safety is not confirmed". It was impossible to confirm safety of 8 thousand people in Iwate prefecture. The number of people evacuated makes 450 thousand. There is a significant lack of drinking water, meals and gasoline in the disaster area. This tragedy forced Japanese Authorities ask for help from abroad. For the first time in history Russian rescue team was sent to Japan. This earthquake was felt on the territory of Russia in Kuril Islands: in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and Kurilsk - with intensity 4, in Malokurilsk - with intensity 3. Aftershock which occurred at 06:25 was felt in Yuzhno-Kurilsk with intensity 5, in Kurilsk - with intensity 4. Tsunami warning system sent alarm signal about the danger to Kurils Islands. Russian EMERCOM reported that 11 thousand people were evacuated from potential zone of flooding, all forces of rescue teams worked in the ready to action state. Tsunami was observed in the region of Kunashir Island (near Yuzhno-Kurilsk town) and near Shikotan and Iturup Islands with waves of two meters high. Fig. 5, downloaded from Web Site of NEIC USA , presents the map with intensities obtained from phone calls to 336 residents in 118 places.

Figure 4 Historical records In accordance with NEIC USA in June 15, 1896 it was registered the earthquake with M=8.5 in this region. That earthquake caused tsunami with waves of 25 meters height, it killed 27000 people. In the same region on March 2, 1933 it was observed another earthquake with magnitude M=8.4 in 178 km E-N-E off the reported here earthquake of March 11, 2011. That earthquake caused tsunami with waves of 28 metersd height, it killed 3000 people. On March 9, 2011, two days before the reported here catastrophic earthquake, this area was hit by another earthquake which occurred 44 km N-E with magnitude M=7.7. Focal mechanism and seismic moment of the earthquake Focal mechanism solution for this earthquake which occurred on March 11, 2011 at 05:46 GMT was calculated in IPC GS RAS with first signs of initial arrivals of P-waves at 97 stations, including 81 stations which registered the waves of compression (plus signs), and 16 stations which registered the waves of expansion (minus signs). These stations are located in the interval of epicentral distances of 3º-83º with rather uniform distribution along the azimuths. Focal mechanism solution in stereographic projection at lower hemisphere is shown in figure 4, elements of this solution are presented in table 2. Table 2 and figures 5, 6 also present the solutions obtained with CMT technique in NEIC USA, USGS. All solutions are almost identical. This earthquake occurred under the action of both expansion and compression forces oriented N-W-S-E. Nodal plane with N-E direction of propagation is steeply falling (DP=78º–84º),the type of motion along it – uplift with component of right side slip. Another plane is flat and propagates from N-W to S-E, the type of motion along it – overthrust with left side slip component (DP=17º-19º). Seismic moment of this earthquake which occurred on March 11, 2011 was calculated in IPC GS RAS with spectra of Р-waves obtained at four stations: «Talaya» (∆ 30.27º), «Arti» (∆ 56.09º), «Obninsk» (∆ 67.69º), «Kislovodsk» (∆ 70.84º), it makes Mo=3.5*10**21 n*m. Averaged value of moment magnitude Mw was calculated with Kanamori formula and makes Mw=8.3. The value of seismic moment of this earthquake which occurred on March 11, 2011 in accordance with USGS makes Mo=2.8*10**22 n*m and the value of moment magnitude makes Mw=8.9.
