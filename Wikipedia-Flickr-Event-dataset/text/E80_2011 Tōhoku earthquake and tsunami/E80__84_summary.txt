Japan tsunami victim's soccer ball found in Alaska ALASKAPhoto: Jiji Press, AFP/Getty Images Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 This handout picture taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US and received via Jiji Press in Tokyo on April 23, 2012 shows a football which was found in Alaska and drifted from Japan's Rikuzentakata following the March, 2011 tsunami.
But now, thanks to an observant beachcomber in the Gulf of Alaska, he is set to have his football returned to him.
"I've never imagined that my ball has reached Alaska," Misaki told public broadcaster NHK.
Earlier this month, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter fired on and sank a fishing boat in the Gulf of Alaska that had drifted from Japan after the tsunami.
David Baxter, a radar technician from Kasilof, Alaska, found Misaki's ball while beachcombing in March on Middleton Island, 70 miles south of the Alaskan mainland.
