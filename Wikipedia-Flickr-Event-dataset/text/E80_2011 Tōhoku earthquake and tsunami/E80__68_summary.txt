The isolated residents, holed up in a school in a less-damaged part of Miyatojima Island in Miyagi Prefecture, take turns cooking rice and making rice balls with their famous seaweed in the spirit of survival.
“People on this island are very strong,” said Sanae Katahira, a 48-year-old nursery teacher at an elementary school on Honshu.
The schoolyard is relatively unscathed, and helicopters bring in relief supplies and take sick people off the island.
With the death toll rising and many people unaccounted for, relief supplies to evacuees are still in short supply, and the ongoing nuclear crisis in Fukushima Prefecture has exacerbated their worries.
“But to me, it’s like people are going back to the old way, to the time they had to sustain themselves as islanders when isolated.”
