Vehicle registration offices in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures have been inundated with people wanting to deregister vehicles lost or damaged in the March 11 tsunami, with applications for more than 15,000 vehicles filed by the end of May.
An official at the Miyagi branch of the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministryâ€™s regional transport bureau said processing all the applications will take a long time.
According to the bureau, the number of applications to deregister vehicles permanently shot up after a measure cleared the Diet on April 27, stipulating disaster-relief steps, including refunds for automobile taxes already paid.
In the three prefectures, registrations for 256 vehicles were permanently removed between March 11 and 31.
The actual number of automobiles being deregistered is believed to be higher, as the figures do not include minicars.
