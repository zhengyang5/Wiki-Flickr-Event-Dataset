Monday night, one person was killed in Iwaki and several others were trapped when a powerful 6.6-magnitude earthquake triggered landslides there, the fire department said.
It happened exactly one month after the country's devastating 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan delayed a scheduled news conference as a result of the earthquake, his office said.
The Tokyo Electric Power Company said 220,000 households and businesses in Fukushima were without power after Monday's quake.
Japan has been hit with hundreds of aftershocks since the March 11 earthquake and ensuing tsunami that killed at least 13,116 people.
