To help people affected by the devastating earthquake in Japan, AT&T on Monday has made wireless calls from the United States and Puerto Rico to Japan free for postpaid customers through March 31. Furthermore, text messages to Japan, originating from a U.S. wireless number, will also be free through the end of the month.

Wireline calls 60 minutes or shorter from the U.S. to Japan will be free between March 11 and March 31.

The company has also made TV Japan, which brings 24-hour news from Japan, free through March 17 to all U-verse subscribers.

Finally, AT&T points out that its wireless customers can text "redcross" to 90999 (at no cost) to donate $10 to the Red Cross and help its disaster relief efforts in the area.
