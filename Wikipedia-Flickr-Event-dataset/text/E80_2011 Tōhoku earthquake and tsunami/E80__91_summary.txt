The March 11 disaster killed 378 elementary, junior high and high school students and left 158 others missing, the boards of education in the three hardest-hit prefectures have said.
Most of the victims left school before or just after the 2:46 p.m. earthquake and were swept away by tsunami, they said Wednesday.
The total of 536 killed and missing students was limited to the three prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima and comprises 234 elementary, 111 junior high and 191 high school students.
Out of the 378 students confirmed dead, 273 were in Miyagi, 59 in Fukushima and 46 in Iwate.
The list of missing students is made up of 74 in Miyagi, 52 in Iwate and 32 in Fukushima.
