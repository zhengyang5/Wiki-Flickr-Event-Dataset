But the March 11 tsunami and his team’s research have been influential in initiating a paradigm shift in Japanese seismological studies over the past year.
Shishikura’s team took soil layer samples along the Tohoku coast and checked them against disaster accounts recorded in ancient chronicles.
This helped them conclude that major temblors and tsunami repeatedly slam Tohoku over a cycle of between 500 and 1,000 years.
Shishikura’s team even drew up maps of the areas flooded by the 869 tsunami and planned to distribute copies to residents along the coast.
The Yomiuri report was based on an estimate by the University of Tokyo’s Earthquake Research Institute, which immediately played down the significance of its own estimate.
