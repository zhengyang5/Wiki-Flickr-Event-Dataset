Top Story — The Ecuadoran government sent six tons of water and food to the Galapagos Islands, after the area was hit by a tsunami caused by the earthquake off Japan.

The aid was shipped on Monday to 260 families on the islands of Santa Cruz and San Cristobal after their fishing boats and livelihoods were destroyed by the tsunami.

Police initially reported no major damages on the islands, which lay 620 miles off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean.

Water from the tsunami came up to a third of a mile inland in the Galapagos, causing minor damage to homes and docks as well as merging a lagoon with the sea.

The islands are home to unique animal species that were the inspiration for Charles Darwin’s ideas on evolution.

The massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami that struck off the coast of Japan also forced many Latin American nations with coastlines on the Pacific ocean to close ports, oil pipelines, roads and schools.

Chile closed its northern ports of Iquique and Antofagasta, Mexico shut down three ports and Ecuador’s state oil company PetroEcuador suspended crude oil shipments.

On the Galapagos, tour operators Lindblad Expeditions, which keeps two ships in the islands year-round, ordered them to stay away from the coast with their guests aboard.
