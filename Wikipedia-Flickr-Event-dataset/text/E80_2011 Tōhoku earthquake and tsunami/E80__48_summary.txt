Residents of Tokyo likely had about 80 seconds of warning before a devastating quake rumbled through the city after striking 373 kilometers away, off Japanâ€™s northeast coast, thanks to a new early warning system.
The quake struck at 5:46 GMT.
Countries including Taiwan and Mexico are implementing similar systems, and California has been researching a warning system.
The Japanese government issued a local tsunami warning three minutes after the quake struck, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, run by NOAA, issued its regional warning nine minutes after the quake struck, or at 5:55 GMT.
Residents of the hardest-hit areas likely only had 15 minutes of warning, though Tokyo would have had at least 40 minutes of warning.
