An astronaut aboard the International Space Station captured this view of the HTV cargo craft March 20 as the complex traveled over eastern Canada.
The three-person space station crew was scheduled to close the hatch between the Harmony module and the HTV Sunday morning.
Nicknamed Kounotori 2, the HTV blasted off Jan. 22 from the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan and reached the space station five days later.
