(Kyodo) A coastal whaling base in Miyagi Prefecture has been virtually destroyed by the powerful tsunami triggered by last Friday’s massive earthquake, which washed away a whale-processing facility.
Ayukawa had prospered as a whaling base, attracting many fishing firms after a whaling company from Yamaguchi Prefecture opened an office there in 1906.
But the number of whaling vessels has declined to just two small ships, compared with 13 in the first half of the 1930s, as International Whaling Commission regulations have slashed whaling quotas.
Reviving it may take 20 to 30 years.”But a source linked to the industry said the whaling culture should be preserved.
“As long as there are people who will carry on whaling even in the absence of vessels or facilities, whaling could be revived eventually.”
