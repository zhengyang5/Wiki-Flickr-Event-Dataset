The Earth's tilt and rotational spin on its axis as it travels around the Sun causes our seasons.
The earthquake in Japan moved the axis of rotation by around 16 cm.
1 degree change to the tilt of the axis of the Earth would mean moving it by around 110 km.
In order to conserve angular momentum, the changes in inertia are compensated by changes in the rate of rotation of the Earth about the axis.
This increase in momentum makes the Earth spin faster and our days become slightly shorter by 1-2 milliseconds.
