Pinacle Rock on the Galapagos IslandEcuador Sends Aid To Galapagos After Islands Hit By Tsunami From JapanMarch 15, 2011 By StaffToday in Latin AmericaTop Story — The Ecuadoran government sent six tons of water and food to the Galapagos Islands, after the area was hit by a tsunami caused by the earthquake off Japan.
The aid was shipped on Monday to 260 families on the islands of Santa Cruz and San Cristobal after their fishing boats and livelihoods were destroyed by the tsunami.
Police initially reported no major damages on the islands, which lay 620 miles off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean.
The islands are home to unique animal species that were the inspiration for Charles Darwin’s ideas on evolution.
On the Galapagos, tour operators Lindblad Expeditions, which keeps two ships in the islands year-round, ordered them to stay away from the coast with their guests aboard.
