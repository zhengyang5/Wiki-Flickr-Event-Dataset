The photos of the 84 victims — 74 children and 10 teachers — from the city-run Okawa Elementary School were displayed in honor of the dead at the ceremony, which had to be held at another school due to building damage.
Okawa Elementary School started a new academic year there on April 21.
One of the attendees, Nao Takahashi, 73, from Higashimatsushima, Miyagi Prefecture, lost two young relatives in the disaster, a girl in the second grade and the other in the fourth.
After the memorial service, some families headed to Okawa Elementary School, where they lost their children.
“It still feels as if this isn’t real,” said Ayako Suzuki, 56, who lost her mother in the tsunami.
