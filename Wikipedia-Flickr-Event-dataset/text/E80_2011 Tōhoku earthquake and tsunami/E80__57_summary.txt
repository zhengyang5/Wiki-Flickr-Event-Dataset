Kyodo NewsA 10-meter tsunami was observed at Sendai port in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, in northeastern Japan, at around 3:55 p.m. after a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 rocked the region Friday, local police said.
A tsunami expert at the government-affiliated Port and Airport Research Institute called the tsunami seen following the quake "one of the highest and the widest in the area of devastation in the nation."
The Sendai airport authority in Miyagi Prefecture said the airport runways were submerged by tidal waves.
A 7.3-meter tsunami was also observed in Soma port in Sendai and elsewhere, the agency said, adding a 4.1-meter tsunami was observed in Kamaishi port in Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan, the agency said.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said a tsunami warning was in effect for Russia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Chile, Marcus Island and the Northern Marianas, while weather agencies in the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Panama and Peru also issued similar warnings.
