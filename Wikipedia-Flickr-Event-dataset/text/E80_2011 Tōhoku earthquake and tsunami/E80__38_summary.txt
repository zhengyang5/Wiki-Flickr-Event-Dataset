Many of the prefecture’s residents are still living in tilted homes, as they can’t afford to fix them themselves and financial support from the central and local governments is minimal.
The Chiba city of Urayasu, home to Tokyo Disneyland, suffered the worst damage.
Mayor Hideki Matsuzaki has requested ¥24.8 billion from the central government for infrastructure repair work, but a year after the disaster, Urayasu has only received ¥70 million.
Due to its proximity to Tokyo, Chiba Prefecture’s population has grown every year since 1945, even as Japan’s overall populace is shrinking.
About 90 percent of the decline was attributed to residents relocating outside the prefecture.
