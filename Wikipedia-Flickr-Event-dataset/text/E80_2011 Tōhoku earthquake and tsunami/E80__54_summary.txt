And then there are early warning systems.
How good are the early warning systems?
Two or three minutes after the earthquake, the tsunami warning system center knew where the earthquake was.
The earthquake took place some 200 kilometers away from the Japan's coast, and it took 10 or 15 minutes for the tsunami to reach land.
Within 10 minutes of the earthquake, the American warning system in Hawaii released a list of all possible times and locations where the tsunami could hit.
