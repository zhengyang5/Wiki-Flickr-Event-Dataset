SENDAI (Kyodo) The death toll from Friday’s devastating earthquake and tsunami in northeast Japan will likely surpass 10,000, the police chief of hard-hit Miyagi Prefecture said Sunday.
As of 7:30 p.m., the death toll as confirmed by the National Police Agency topped 1,217 while the number of missing was 1,086, they said.
In Fukushima Prefecture alone, 1,167 people were missing and well over 600 bodies had been found in Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.
In Minamisanriku, also in Miyagi, about 10,000 people — or over half the town’s population — remain unaccounted for.
Ground SDF troops, meanwhile, rescued about 5,800 people in the Miyagi town of Kesennuma and its vicinity, the Defense Ministry said.
