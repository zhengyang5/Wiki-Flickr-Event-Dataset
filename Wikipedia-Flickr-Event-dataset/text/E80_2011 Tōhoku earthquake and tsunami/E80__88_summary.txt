As many as 100,000 children may have been displaced by the earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan's north-west coast last Friday, Save the Children has warned.
The British charity said it was concerned that some of the children affected by the disaster may have been separated from their families.
The organisation believes around a fifth of the 500,000 thousand people displaced by the disaster are children.
"Save the Children has been in Japan for 25 years," he said.
The charity fears many children were separated from their parents and relatives by the tsunami or during the chaos that followed.
