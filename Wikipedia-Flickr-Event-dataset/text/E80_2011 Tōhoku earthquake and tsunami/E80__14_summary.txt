GOCE: the first seismometer in orbitSatellites map changes in Earth’s surface caused by earthquakes but never before have sound waves from a quake been sensed directly in space – until now.
ESA’s hyper-sensitive GOCE gravity satellite has added yet another first to its list of successes.
Earthquakes not only create seismic waves that travel through Earth’s interior, but large quakes also cause the surface of the planet to vibrate like a drum.
This produces sound waves that travel upwards through the atmosphere.
New studies have revealed that this massive quake was also felt in space by ESA’s GOCE satellite.
