The World Bank on Monday issued a report saying the damage from Japan's earthquake and tsunami could amount to as much as $235 billion and that limited effects from the disaster will be felt in economies across East Asia.
World Bank economist Vikram Nehru said the economic fallout would certainly be felt around the region, given Japan's part in East Asia's economy, but that it would be "short-lived."
We expect growth in Japan will pick up as reconstruction efforts accelerate," Nehru said, according to a World Bank news release.
Using the 1995 Kobe earthquake as a barometer, the organization estimated that the damages would be in the range of $122 billion to $235 billion.
China and the Philippines have economies closely tied to Japan's and will be more heavily affected, the World Bank said.
