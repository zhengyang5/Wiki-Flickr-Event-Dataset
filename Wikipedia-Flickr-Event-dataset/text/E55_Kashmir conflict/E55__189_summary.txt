Human Rights Watch called for an independent, transparent, and time-bound commission to investigate allegations of enforced disappearances.
"There can be no lasting political settlement in Kashmir unless human rights abuses that have fueled the insurgency are addressed."
Human Rights Watch called for the repeal of laws such as the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act, the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, and the Public Safety Act.
These laws provide the armed forces with extraordinary powers to search, detain, and use lethal force, leading to numerous human rights violations.
Human Rights Watch has, over the two decades of violence in Jammu and Kashmir, documented numerous failures to ensure protection of human rights.
