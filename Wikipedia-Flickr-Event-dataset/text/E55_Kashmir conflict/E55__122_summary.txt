When Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf labeled the Kashmir election a "farce," he was a victim of either false reporting or false hopes.
The most serious mistake was made in 1987, when New Delhi colluded with the Kashmir government to steal an election.
And Pakistan's return to Army autocracy has ended any illusions Kashmiri Muslims might have entertained about their alleged benefactor.
Of course, plenty of Kashmiri Muslims want azaadi  independence  but they too believe that a Kashmiri state would be incomplete without its distinctive Hindu minority.
There is more at stake in Kashmir than Kashmir.
