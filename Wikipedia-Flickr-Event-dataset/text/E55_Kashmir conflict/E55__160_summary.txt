Understanding the turnoutIt will be erroneous to construe the high voter turnout as a sign of Kashmiris embracing the Indian Constitution.
There are varied determining factors, embedded in the political conflict situation of Kashmir that influence people’s decision to vote.
A development professional from Ganderbal said if Kashmiris don’t vote, then the elected representatives will be more pro-India and less pro-Kashmiri people.
In 1987, followed by a popular uprising and full-fledged guerrilla warfare against India, there was a record voter turnout of 74.9 per cent.
Should we not be asking, instead, whether this high voter turnout has been able to change the political reality of Kashmir?
