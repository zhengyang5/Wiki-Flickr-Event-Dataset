A senior intelligence official in Kashmir said officers were trying to trace the call, made over a local landline to Kashmir's Current News Service.
"Our immediate effort is to locate the caller and ascertain the authenticity of the claim," the official told The AP on condition of anonymity.
India's Foreign Ministry condemned Kasuri's remarks as "appalling."
India is sensitive to any suggestion that it should make concessions on Kashmir before Pakistan takes stronger action against extremist activity within its borders.
The Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna called on Pakistan to crack down on militant groups.
