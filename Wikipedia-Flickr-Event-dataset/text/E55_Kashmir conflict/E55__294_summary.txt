INDIA AND PAKISTANThe Musharraf formula B. MURALIDHAR REDDYin Islamabad President Pervez Musharraf's new proposal on Kashmir is a clever one.
The two-paragraph report gave an insight into the thinking of the managers of Musharraf on the latest Kashmir `formula'.
But the famous Chenab Formula was the subject of discussion at the "track-two" level talks between the governments of Nawaz Sharif and Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1999.
Musharraf did make it a point to mention that India was not ready to accept a religion-based solution and sought to sell his formula "in geographical terms".
Even as he talked about seven "regions" in Jammu and Kashmir, Musharraf listed three specific steps that India and Pakistan should take.
