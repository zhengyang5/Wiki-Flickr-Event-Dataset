Washington, DC --- U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) introduced a resolution today in the U.S. House of Representatives condemning the human rights violations against the Kashmiri Pandits, Hindu residents of the Kashmir Valley, over the past 15 years. prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /

Pallone, who founded the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans and Chairs the Caucus' Kashmir Task Force, introduced the resolution to urge the Government of India and the State Government of Jammu and Kashmir to work with the Pandit community to find a peaceful, equitable solution to the conflict currently taking place in the Kashmir Valley.

"The conflict in Kashmir cannot be separated from the global war against terrorism," Pallone said. "Over the past fifteen years militant forces, including elements of al Qaeda and the Taliban, have used violence against the Kashmiri Pandits in an effort to institute Islamic rule in this region.

"Terrorism has shattered the lives of the people of Kashmir for far too long. The United States and the international community must recognize their plight and take action to promote peace," Pallone continued. "Working alongside India and Pakistan, we must ensure these atrocities come to an end."

Control of Kashmir, a region located between India and Pakistan, has long been disputed between India, Pakistan and China. Islamic terrorists infiltrated the region in 1989 and began an ethnic cleansing campaign to convert Kashmir to a Muslim state. Since that time, over 400,000 Kashmiri Hindus have either been murdered or forced from their homes.
