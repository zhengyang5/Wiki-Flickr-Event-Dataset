Delhi accuses Islamabad of supporting insurgents in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Addressing large crowds, Mr Vajpayee accused Pakistan of renewed cross-border attacks in Kashmir, and said it was trying to open up new fronts with India.





"I assure the countrymen that the neighbours will not be allowed to succeed in their attempts," Mr Vajpayee told supporters in the industrial town of Ludhiana.

Pakistan has denied involvement in the 10-week military conflict in the Kargil sector of Kashmir.

Joint campaign

Saturday's rally marked the launch of a joint campaign by the BJP and Punjab's ruling Shiromani Akali Dal party.

The gathering was also addressed by the chief ministers of Punjab and of the neighbouring state of Haryana.

At a later gathering of newspaper editors, Mr Vajpayee said the India-Pakistan talks in Lahore earlier this year signalled India's desire for peace with Pakistan.

But he also said that the Kargil conflict left no doubt that India was fully prepared to tackle any hostilities sponsored across the border.

'BJP compromised security'





Sonia Gandhi: "Government was dozing"

Addressing a rally at Jharsuguda in Orissa state, Mrs Gandhi accused the BJP of compromising Indian security.

"This government appeared to have been dozing when the enemy seized control of our territory," the opposition leader said.
