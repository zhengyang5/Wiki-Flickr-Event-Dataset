Situated in the extreme northwest corner of the South Asian subcontinent, it was one of the largest and most populous princely states of British India, sharing borders with India, Pakistan, and China.
In 1940, Jinnah 's “Pakistan declaration” demanded a homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent (to be called Pakistan).
On the eve of partition in 1947 there were three main political forces in Kashmir: the National Conference, the Muslim Conference, and the Dogra dynasty.
These events convinced the Pakistanis that, despite the state 's Muslim majority, the maharaja would eventually be maneuvered into acceding to India.
However, Abdullah 's own controversial statements regarding Kashmir 's future, including appearing to favor the state 's independence, resulted in his arrest in 1953.
