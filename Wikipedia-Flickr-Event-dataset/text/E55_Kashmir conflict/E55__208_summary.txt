Washington, DC --- U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) introduced a resolution today in the U.S. House of Representatives condemning the human rights violations against the Kashmiri Pandits, Hindu residents of the Kashmir Valley, over the past 15 years.
"Over the past fifteen years militant forces, including elements of al Qaeda and the Taliban, have used violence against the Kashmiri Pandits in an effort to institute Islamic rule in this region.
The United States and the international community must recognize their plight and take action to promote peace," Pallone continued.
Control of Kashmir, a region located between India and Pakistan, has long been disputed between India, Pakistan and China.
Islamic terrorists infiltrated the region in 1989 and began an ethnic cleansing campaign to convert Kashmir to a Muslim state.
