It is believed that, Islamist militancy is not only trained but also exported to South Asian region and other destinations from this place under the direct patronization of Pakistani Inter Service Intelligence [ISI].Jammu and Kashmir is home to several valleys such as the Kashmir Valley, Tawi Valley, Chenab Valley, Poonch Valley, Sind Valley and Lidder Valley.
The main Kashmir valley is 100 km [62 mile] wide and 15,520.3 km [5,992.4 sq mile] in area.
These give way to a broad band of western Himalayan broadleaf forests running from northwest-southeast across the Kashmir Valley.
Pakistan has consistently denied such allegation and tried to say that, they only are ‘helping’ their ‘Muslim Jihadist Brethren’ in ‘Indian occupied Kashmir’.
Pakistani rulers claim that, Kashmir is being ‘occupied’ by India, though they never can give any answer as to what they think about part of Kashmir in Pakistan.
