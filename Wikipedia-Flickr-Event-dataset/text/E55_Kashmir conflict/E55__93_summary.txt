Killings in the name of religionThe bone of contention was the supposed role of foreign militants in bringing a bad name to Kashmir.
A charged Mr. Abdullah remarked that foreign militants, who had nothing to do with Kashmir, were engaged in reckless killings and mayhem in the name of religion.
An angry Mr. Abdullah appealed to the press not to distort his comments and asserted that he never talked about militants of Kashmir origin.
Much to the disbelief of the audience, a journalist wanted to know from Mr. Abdullah whether he was disassociating himself being a Muslim.
To persistent questions on Kashmir, Mr. Abdullah said: "Let's look ahead and not get into the past which would embarrass many of us."
