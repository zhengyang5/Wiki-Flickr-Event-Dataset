NEW DELHI: With Kashmir reportedly being excluded from the UN list of unresolved disputes, the US today said it was an "internal issue" of India and should be resolved bilaterally through negotiations with Pakistan.
"This is an internal issue for India.
It is a bilateral issue between Pakistan and India, to discuss term, scope, character and pace," US Ambassador Timothy Roemer said.He was asked to comment on UN excluding Kashmir from list of unresolved international issues.
"The (US) President ( Barack Obama ), I think was very articulate on this issue of Kashmir.
It was one of the many highlights of (his) visit to India..We will be working to see that happen," Roemer said.
