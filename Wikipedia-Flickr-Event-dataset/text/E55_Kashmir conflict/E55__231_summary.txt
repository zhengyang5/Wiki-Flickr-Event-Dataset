Peter Chalk investigates the extent of Pakistan's support for groups in Kashmir and how this assistance has impacted on the course and development of the conflict.
Reasons for Pakistani backingThere are currently five main groups fighting in Kashmir, all of which benefit from Pakistani support:- Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM);- Laskhar-e-Tayyiba (LeT);- al Badr;- Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM); and- Harakat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM).
Financing the militantsApart from military backing, Pakistan plays an important role in financing Kashmiri insurgents.
Pakistan's impactPakistan has fundamentally altered the dimensions of the conflict in Kashmir.
More intrinsically, the nature of the Kashmir conflict has been transformed from what was originally a secular, locally- based struggle (conducted via the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front - JKLF) to one that is now largely carried out by foreign militants and rationalised in pan-Islamic religious terms.
