Kashmir insurgencyArmed resistance to Indian rule broke out in the Kashmir valley in 1989, with some groups calling for independence and others calling for union with Pakistan.
India accused Pakistan of supplying weapons to the militants.
Some groups demanded independence for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and others union with Pakistan.
Pakistan gave its "moral and diplomatic" support to the movement, calling for the issue to be resolved via a UN-sponsored referendum.
But the government of India maintained that Pakistan's support of the insurgency consisted of training and supplying weapons to militant separatists and repeatedly called for Pakistan to cease "cross-border terrorism".
