Mustafa Kamal, brother of Union Minister Farooq Abdullah, on Sunday blamed security forces, former Jammu and Kashmir governor Jagmohan and PDP leader Mufti Sayeed for forcing the migration of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley.
"It was the government which forced Kashmiri Pandits to flee Valley.
It was Army, governor Jagmohan and PDP leader Mufti Sayeed who played a role in this," Kamal, who was health minister in the previous NC government, told The Indian Express.
I will tell you that Jagmohan did it so that he has a free hand in dealing with Muslim majority in Valley".
"People in the Valley are not responsible for this, the government and the security machinery is," Kamal said.
