In his speech, Mr. Geelani said the problem of Kashmir is one of “broken promises” right from the beginning.
The Union Minister said that he would welcome any solution to the Kashmir problem within the framework of Indian Constitution.
Mr. Geelani should not forget that Kashmir was not about Muslims alone but also comprised Hindus, Buddhists and Christians.
Mr. Geelani said when he talked about Kashmir, he meant the entire state and not just the valley.
Mr. Geelani talked about the alleged excesses by the security forces against the people of Kashmir and the stone pelters who were killed.
