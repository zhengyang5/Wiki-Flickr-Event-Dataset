Baroness Emma Nicholson, the author of the European Parliament’s (EP) Kashmir report, said Gilgit and Baltistan will be a litmus test for Pakistan’s new government.
She was addressing a two-day conference on Gilgit and Baltistan held in the European Parliament here last week under the auspices of the International Kashmir Alliance (IKA).
MEP Charles Tannock criticized what he called “discriminatory policies” of Pakistan’s Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas.
He also called on the EP to send a fact-finding mission to Gilgit and Baltistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.
Besides several MEPs, representatives of civil society in Europe, the Kashmir diaspora and journalists attended the conference, noted the press release.
