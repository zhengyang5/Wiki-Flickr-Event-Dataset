But the most damaging conflict is and has always been the fight for Kashmir, the source of India's bloody rivalry with Pakistan.
The United States thus finds itself in a familiar spot: between a rock and a hard place.
Taking a long view of the conflict, Obama seems to have concluded that resolving the dispute over Kashmir will allow Pakistan to focus on defeating Islamist militants in Afghanistan and within its own borders.
The smartest thing President Obama could do on Kashmir is probably nothing.
We have to hope that India and Pakistan can work out their differences on Kashmir on their own.
