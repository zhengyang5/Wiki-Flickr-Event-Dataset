REUTERS/Abrar TanoliPakistan’s Northern Areas have never officially been part of the country, instead they have been a part of the Pakistani-controlled portion of the disputed Kashmir region since shortly after Pakistan’s independence in 1947.
In September, India protested to Pakistan over its reform package, saying it was meant to “camouflage Pakistan’s illegal occupation” of the area.
About 300 activists from Kashmiri groups marked the election with a protest in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir.
“If people in (Indian) occupied and Azad (Pakistani) Kashmir can have their own assemblies, why can’t we?”
