PAMPORE: About 8km south of Srinagar, the road seems to end. Hundreds of trucks, cars and motorbikes block the path. The men shout "azadi" and "Allah-u-Akbar" (God is great) in collective frenzy. They are all heading to Pampore, about 15 km from Srinagar, for the Hurriyat leader Shiekh Abdul Aziz's memorial service.There's no way you can proceed on the highway; so we take a detour through a dirty makeshift road past the stone quarries, the brick kilns and the shanty tenements of the Bihari labourers. There's Jhelum on one side with thick groves lining the embankment; the other side is lush with paddy fields. On the side, women sing songs saluting the 'martyrs' and kids offer free soft drinks to protestors.But it's only when one steps into Pampore, famous for its saffron fields, that the real magnitude of the gathering becomes evident. It looks like most of Kashmir has turned up. The political mobilisation seems to have worked. Crowd estimates are always dicey ��� but some estimate the Pampore gathering at perhaps 5 lakh. There's a sea of heads on the streets, rooftops, lanes, walls, even on telephone towers.A youth draws loud cheers when he hoists the green Islamic flag atop a tower, nearly 10 storeys tall. Another braveheart soon steals his thunder climbing the taller adjoining tower as "azadi" slogans fill the air.There are only two colours of flag on display. The black flag as a mark of protest and the green flag with Allah-o-Akbar printed on it. Women are relatively fewer but those present, including a bunch in burqa, chant slogans with gusto."Do you think the massive, peaceful turnout will have any positive effect on the Indian government?" asks Mohammed Ashraf, a poultry farmer from Budgam. Ashraf is illiterate but listens to Gandhi Katha on Radio."You know, Gandhiji did not use arms against the British. He used non-violence to mobilize people. Is non-violence more effective than violence in getting azadi?" he asks. Unlike Ashraf, Mukhtiar Ahmed is bitter. He doesn't like anything about India. Last year he traveled to Gorakhpur in UP."I stayed with a Bihari labourer who also works for us. But two people were killed near by and police picked me for questioning. The labourer kept pleading them to let me off but they didn't listen to him. As a Kashmiri, you are always under suspicion," says Ashraf.That's how it's. Lakhs of people, with their own reasons to believe that "azadi" is the best choice for them. Few would have heard what the Hurriyat leaders had to say.
