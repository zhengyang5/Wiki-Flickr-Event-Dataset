"Human rights abuses have been a cause as well as a consequence of the insurgency in Kashmir,‚Äù said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
In reality, both sides have committed widespread and numerous human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law (or the laws of war).
