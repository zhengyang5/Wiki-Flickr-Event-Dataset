"[Quran 4:76]Some American writers have published articles under the title 'On what basis are we fighting?'
(c) Also the American army is part of the American people.
It is this very same people who are shamelessly helping the Jews fight against us.
(d) The American people are the ones who employ both their men and their women in the American Forces which attack us.
The American Government and press still refuses to answer the question:Why did they attack us in New York and Washington?
