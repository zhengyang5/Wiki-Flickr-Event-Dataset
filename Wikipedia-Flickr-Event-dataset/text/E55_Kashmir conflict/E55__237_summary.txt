Gen Musharraf says he wants troops to withdraw from KashmirGen Musharraf called for a phased withdrawal of troops in the region and self-governance for Kashmiris.
Gen Musharraf told NDTV that he had a "four-point solution" to ending the impasse in the disputed region.
Asked whether he was prepared to give up his country's claim on Kashmir, Gen Musharraf said: "We will have to, yes, if this solution comes up."
This is not the first time that Gen Musharraf has made "out of the box" proposals on Kashmir in media interviews.
In March, Gen Musharraf told the BBC that he expected pressure from US President George W Bush for a solution of the Kashmir dispute.
