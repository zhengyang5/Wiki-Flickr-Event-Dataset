Front Page Pak wishes to have 3rd party mediation on Kashmir: Aziz ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (Agencies): While reiterating Pakistan Prime Minister’s stand on Kashmir that international community should note that bilateral talks on Kashmir have failed, Pakistan’s outgoing National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz has said that Pakistan wish to have third party mediation on Kashmir, but we have not demanded it from the United States.
“Under Shimla Accord it was decided that India and Pakistan would resolve their disputes bilaterally,” Aziz said.
“It is not only an issue of Kashmir,” he said.
“The joint statement describes Kashmir as a dispute, not an issue.
This is significant because US in this statement has agreed that Kashmir is a dispute, previously it was an issue.
