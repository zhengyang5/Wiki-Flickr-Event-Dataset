Image caption Kashmir security forces are accused of abusing the Public Safety ActRights group Amnesty International has criticised a tough Indian law which it says has been used to detain up to 20,000 people without trial in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Amnesty urged India to scrap the Public Safety Act (PSA) which allows detention for up to two years without charge.
Detentions under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act documents how the law is used to secure long-term detention of individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence for a trial.
Amnesty International called upon the government of Jammu and Kashmir to repeal the law and end the system of detentions.
The Himalayan region of Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and is claimed in full by both.
