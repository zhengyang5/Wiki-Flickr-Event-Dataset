“Indian rulers and its first Prime Minister himself have promised the Kashmir people in parliament and in Lal Chowk Srinagar that India will not hold Kashmir forcibly with it and when situation will improve, Kashmir people will be given a chance to decide their future, which will be respected in any way.
‘If Kashmir people will not decide to remain with India then it will be definitely painful for me, but we do not favour forced marriages’,” he reminded Modi.
Geelani said that India has done injustice with the people of Kashmir by not fulfilling their promises and if future Prime Minister of India Modi is sincere about his promise of doing justice, then he should undertake to fulfill the broken promises and Kashmir should be given a chance to choose their future by holding plebiscite in this state.
“But time is the best judge.
Kashmir people are in no way enemies of India or its people but they want that justice should be done with them and their rights should be respected.”Share this: TwitterFacebookWhatsAppPrintMoreGoogle
