BRUSSELS, December 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --

The European Parliament, on the behalf of European Union, welcomes the smooth conduct of the first two phases of the State Legislative Elections in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir. The high voter turnout figure of 70% proves that democracy is firmly rooted in India.

The European Parliament also takes cognizance of the fact that a large number of Kashmiri voters turned out despite calls for the boycott of elections by certain separatist forces. The spectacle of youth and women coming out in large numbers to vote bodes well for the functioning of Indian democracy. Dealing a serious blow to separatist politics, enthusiastic voters stood in serpentine queues at several polling stations waiting for their turn. In light of the stupendous voter turnout in the Kashmir Valley, it is also time to reexamine the claims made by some separatist groups, operating mainly at the behest of India's neighboring state. The high voter turnout reveals that the people of Kashmir have complete faith in India's democratic system and want to be an integral part of the country.

It is high time that the international community should stop paying heed to the malicious anti-India propaganda based on distorted and concocted information by such rabble rousing separatist leaders, backed by India's neighbors, indulging in violence in Jammu and Kashmir.

The EU would like to congratulate India and its democratic system for conduct of fair elections, unmarred by violence, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and hopes that after two decades of violent conflict, peace will finally return to the region. The EU also commits to offer its complete cooperation with the government of India, in satisfying the aspirations of the people and establishing a peace in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
