Pakistans claim to Jammu and Kashmir based on the two nation theory has been debunked by history itself.
For the first time since Pakistan began its propaganda war against India on the Kashmir issue, it is being made answerable for its own repression of its citizens.
At international fora also terrorism and human rights are getting increasingly linked.
The UN has passed resolutions recognising terrorism as a major threat to human rights.
The target of Pakistans propaganda has indeed been India and the Indian people.
