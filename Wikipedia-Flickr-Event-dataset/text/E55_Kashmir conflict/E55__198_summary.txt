A documentary film 'Ocean of Tears' sponsored, examined and approved by Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT) and Information Broadcasting Ministry, has generated a controversy after University of Kashmir stopped screening of the film.
Directed by a Kashmiri film maker, Bilal A Jan, who has divided the documentary into four segments, to present alleged women rights violation in Kashmir, during the two decade long armed conflict.
The documentary film of 27-minute duration, starts with an eye witness account of men and women from Kunanposhpora, a village in frontier district of Kupwara, some 100 km north of Srinagar.
It is interesting to see how the film- maker has convinced the censor board on such contentious issues.
The Film- maker has watered down the intensity willfully by using limited shots of armed forces to avoid any direct accusation.
