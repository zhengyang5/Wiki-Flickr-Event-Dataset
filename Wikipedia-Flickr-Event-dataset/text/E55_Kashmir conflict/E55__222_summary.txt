THE `autonomy package` introduced by the government for the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is a mix of good and bad news.
The good news is that the area will now have an autonomous status with a chief minister and a governor.
Then there`s the border agreement between Pakistan and China which is also provisional and subject to revision upon resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
Others inspired by Kashmiri nationalist leaders call for an independent united states or confederation of Kashmir.
But the increase in the list of subjects for the Gilgit-Baltistan assembly to legislate would mean little if the powers of the governor to discard edicts are not curtailed.
