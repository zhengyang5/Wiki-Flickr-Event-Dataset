By SAAGBy Rajeev SharmaAt a time when the focus is on the India-Pakistan Foreign Secretary-level talks, an important event, taking place on June 26, has gone largely unnoticed: elections in the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).
Preparation of electoral rolls has been controversial even in the last elections in 2006.
Besides bogus identity cards, fake electoral rolls, the federal government was bribing the voters by issuing gas and electricity connections weeks before the elections.
If PoK were to witness a free and fair elections, as it happens in the Indian Kashmir, Pakistan will have no leg to stand on in terms of the hostile policy towards Kashmir and its people as a whole.
Pakistan wants to annex Kashmir as one of its provinces but without giving as legitimate constitutional rights.
