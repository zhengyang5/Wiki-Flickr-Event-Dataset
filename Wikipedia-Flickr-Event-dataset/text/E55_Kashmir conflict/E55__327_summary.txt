survey carried out across both Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, that its author claims is the first ever of its kind, shows that only 2% of the respondents on the Indian side favour joining Pakistan and most such views were confined to Srinagar and Budgam districts.
But in the Valley, the mood for azadi still remained strong, with 75%-95% respondents favouring that as a final resolution.The poll showed no support either for joint sovereignty or for maintaining status quo.
However, more than 58% of those surveyed were prepared to accept the Line of Control as a permanent border if it could be liberalized for greater people-to-people contact and trade.
"It can't be wished away and has to be configured into the future strategy on Kashmir.
We've always been pleading to provide an alternative to the azadi sentiment."
