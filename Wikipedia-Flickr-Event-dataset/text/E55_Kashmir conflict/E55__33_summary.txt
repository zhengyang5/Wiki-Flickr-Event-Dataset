The August 1947 transfer of power in India brought to the fore questions regarding the future of the areas which had long been leased by the government of India from certain princely states.
Focusing on the Gilgit Agency, parts of which were leased from the state of Jammu and Kashmir, this article traces the nature of the agency and the manner in which it ultimately became a de facto part of Pakistan while Kashmir acceded to India.
Conflicting accounts exist as to who was actually responsible for the revolution in Gilgit which led it towards Pakistan.
This article uses all available sources to relate clearly and analyse the actual course of events during the tumultuous months of October and November 1947.
The article also assesses the status and then formal accession of the two small states of Hunza and Nagar, adjacent to Gilgit, which had been erroneously treated as being under the complete suzerainty of Kashmir.
