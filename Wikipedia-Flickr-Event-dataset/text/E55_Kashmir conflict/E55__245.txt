It would be singularly stupid not to look for underlying reasons in the now-rampant phenomenon of stone-pelting that overtakes protests in the city and elsewhere in the valley. Not only because a trigger-happy breed of so-called “security” forces feels free to open fire, fatally, at the slightest pretext, but also because the trend could portend an explosive relapse to means generally thought to have been, finally, put behind by Kashmiri youth.It does not take an alarmist to read serious repercussions into something that is burgeoning despite the fatal deterrent authorities dealing with law and order have built into the government response. Anyone with a reasonably sound memory can recall how Kashmir erupted in the late 1980s after legitimate political aspirations were crushed with violence and deceit. And those advocating the use of lethal force cannot have failed to notice that even widespread use of this tactic during the shrine board agitation has done nothing to curb the propensity of angry crowds to resort to stone-pelting. An indulgent command structure that encourages paramilitary personnel to open fire even where milder measures could have more than sufficed is a dead giveaway to the policy, tacit or otherwise, put in place to deal with restive Kashmir. Or, more disturbingly, it indicates that that the paramilitary personnel, and to some extent the state police, are way out of control.The incidence of firing into demonstrations in Kashmir is far too high to be viewed as an aberration, and inquiries that yield nothing are too flimsy a restraint for personnel who appear to be ill-trained and ill-equipped psychologically to react with professional detachment to situations that demand a firm check on personal likes and dislikes.The bright sparks in the security establishment who favour the bullet-for-stone recourse represent the hidebound school in New Delhi whose perpetual victim Kashmir has been for the past sixty years. This band of myopic - but sadly, influential - operators cannot look beyond its crooked nose to see the damaging and crippling effect of having an entire populace constantly in a state of discontent. In their wisdom, the vessel may seethe and boil for all it is worth – all that it requires is a lid to be clamped down forcibly, and lo and behold, the problem is solved.A more productive course of action would have been to examine the factors that drive youngsters to pick up stones to face heavy, automatic and lethal firepower. There is something primal and visceral in the defiant act of picking up a stone and hurling it on hordes of armed government personnel whose penchant for replying with deadly bullets is too well known. The street battles with the police and the paramilitary personnel are often fought at close quarters, with cheeky youngsters, and even school-age kids, daring armed personnel to react. The fear factor, which mandarins in the security establishment appear to be banking on, has totally evaporated, as the use of violent measures also follows the law of diminishing returns. We now have crowds that brave cane-charges and tear gas shelling, and stand their ground in the face of bullets. Oft times, crowds are known to have used violent means like stone-pelting as a preemptive measure to check the security forces from going on a smashing rampage in their localities during protest demonstrations. And it is known to have worked.It bears repeating that the top leadership in the pro-freedom camp, including Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Syed Ali Shah Geelani, has repeatedly advised and appealed against stone-pelting and other forms of crowd violence. But even branding such acts anti-movement has not dimmed their intensity. Obviously, the sentiment in the crowds, which are mostly comprised of youth barely in their teens, is too deep and profound to yield to such admonishments, and speaks of a strong, if incipient, urge to take matters into their own hands.The chief minister has done well to order security and civilian officers to look into the motivating factors in the rising tide of stone-pelting in Kashmir. He could have been hinting at the possibility of incitement and instigation from various quarters and agencies, and this aspect too merits deep inquiry. But it would be self-serving to dump the blame on convenient scapegoats without a thorough study of the psycho-social factors motivating huge chunks of youth on refractory violence. The evidence so far also tilts against the acts of provocation from the other side, as has recently been seen in the spontaneous upsurge after the Nauhatta killing, and the snowballing violence after each fatal episode during the shrine board agitation. What also sorely needs to be looked into is the existence of rogue elements in the security agencies who might be acting willfully in contravention of laid down codes of action.When the avenues of peaceful assemblage with political connotations are proscribed, violence, whether incited or spontaneous, is inevitable. Instead of meting out blind punishment to the scores of youth held for stone-pelting, it would be more worth the government’s while to delve into their psyche to unravel the nature of the pent-up grievances the youth of today seem to harbour against established authority.
