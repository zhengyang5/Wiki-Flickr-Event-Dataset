Mr. Malik, sources told The Hindu , met with Dr. Singh shortly before leaving for the United States on November 28, 2005.
He also attended a dinner hosted by the former Pakistan Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif.
While the meetings illustrate the seriousness with which the Prime Minister treats the dialogue process, the secret negotiations are not without critics.
Even as speakers at the meeting called for an escalation of the jihad in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Malik praised the Jamaat's earthquake-relief work.
