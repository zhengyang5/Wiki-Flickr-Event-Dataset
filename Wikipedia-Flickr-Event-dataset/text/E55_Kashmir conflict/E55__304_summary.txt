Northern India started experiencing attacks from Turkic and Arab invaders from eighth century onwards but mountainous region of Kashmir valley largely remained unaffected.
The outcome of continuous persecution was gradual shift in population as well as religion leading to the Kashmir valley becoming predominantly Muslim region.
Pakistan backed militant Muslims and tribesmen made rapid invasion and advances in the Kashmir valley with intention to forcibly occupy and overthrow the Dogra King.
Hence the accession of the Jammu and Kashmir state was total and irrevocable.
Besides, such a plebiscite should be done for the entire Kashmir, including the Pak-Occupid Kashmir (PoK).
