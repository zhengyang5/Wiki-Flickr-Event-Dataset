HARIDWAR: Union home minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday that Pakistan must refrain from demanding a plebiscite in Jammu & Kashmir.
"If at all a referendum is required, it is needed in Pakistan, where people should be asked whether they want to continue in Pakistan or are demanding the country's merger with India," Singh said at a public rally near Haridwar.
"India has always rooted for peaceful relations, but Islamabad repeatedly tries to disrupt the relationship.
There is an urgent need to stop terrorists operating from there, and those who are asking for a referendum on Kashmir," he added.
He said India's surgical strike in POK "sent out a clear message to the world at large about the capability of our defence forces".
