This study is primarily meant for readers outside India, and that explains the lengthy background which it provides. Although literature on the issue is growing daily, each work is written from a certain angle, and that is quite understandable. Every mind has a particular drawing bias; the information supplied is therefore necessarily coloured by tpe views a writer holds. There are to the author's mind two ways of approaching a subject: One would attempt to fit the facts into the value system of the writer, the other would try to draw values from the mass of materials under study. In either case there is no escaping the subjective evaluation of the narrator; and the present writer does not claim any immunity from the process. Kashmir's present history has two aspects. One of them is international, and here the ups and downs in the fortunes of the two States are to be seen against the complexity of power relations in the multinational world body. The other is the internal dynamics, which have their own compelling logic. An attempt has been made in this study to correlate the two into some sort of unity, but it is not for the writer to evaluate its success.
