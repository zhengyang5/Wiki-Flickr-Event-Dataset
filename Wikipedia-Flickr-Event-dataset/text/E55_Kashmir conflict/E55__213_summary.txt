The argument is that, as per the said resolutions, Pakistan needs to be the first mover, which is right.
However, there is a gross lack of knowledge, in the common masses, including this so-called analystâ€™, about the context revolving it.
Having read closely, the United Nations Kashmir documents, I can tell you with authority where exactly such unprofessional or part-time diplomats falter.
It's only up to Pakistan and India to decide any changes; the UN just has to provide its supervision.
Till then, you cannot use this argument.
