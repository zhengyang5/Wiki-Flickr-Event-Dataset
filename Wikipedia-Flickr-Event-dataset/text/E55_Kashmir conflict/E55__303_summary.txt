NEW DELHI: Separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani Tuesday said Kashmir is an international issue and not an internal issue of India.
"First of all when they say Kashmir is an internal issue, it is against the reality.
The issue of Jammu and Kashmir is an international issue and it should be solved," Geelani, who is in Delhi to meet Pakistan's high commissioner, told reporters at the airport.
"New Delhi over reacted on the issue...There has to be a peaceful, political resolution to the Kashmir issue," Farooq told a news channel.
The Indian government Monday called off the Aug 25 foreign secretary-level talks, calling Pakistan's engagement with the Kashmiri separatist unacceptable.
