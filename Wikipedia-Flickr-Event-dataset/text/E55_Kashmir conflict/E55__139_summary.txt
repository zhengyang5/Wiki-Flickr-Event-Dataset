Conflict Rape Victims:Abandoned And ForgottenBy Syed Junaid Hashmi31 March, 2007Countercurrents.orgD eserted by their families, abandoned by society, forgotten by both separatists and mainstream political parties, rape victims during the last seventeen years of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir live an appalling life.
Interestingly, State home department has no specific data regarding the number of rapes and molestation cases that took place in the state during the last seventeen years.
When contacted, officials in the home department say that media reports regarding the number of rape and molestation cases hardly predict the actual picture.
Further, they maintain that families of allegedly raped women hardly take pain in going to the police and registering FIR against the accused, hence preventing the guilty from being convicted.
