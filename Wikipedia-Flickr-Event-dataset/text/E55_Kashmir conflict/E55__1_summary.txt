Why do India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir?
Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, Kashmir was hotly contested.
Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Kashmir was free to accede to India or Pakistan.
Pakistan later promised to stop funding insurgents in the territory while India offered them an amnesty if they renounced militancy.
