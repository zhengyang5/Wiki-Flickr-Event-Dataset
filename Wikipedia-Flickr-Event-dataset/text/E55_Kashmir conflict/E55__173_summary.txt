Image caption Pervez Musharraf criticised international 'apathy' over KashmirFormer Pakistani military ruler Pervez Musharraf has told a magazine that his forces trained militant groups to fight in Indian-administered Kashmir.
India has always alleged that Pakistan trained militants in the 1990s.
Mr Musharraf said in the interview that militant groups "were indeed formed" in part because of the international community's "apathy" over the Kashmir dispute.
Mr Musharraf said: "I... sincerely apologise to the whole nation" for the "negative repercussions".
Mr Musharraf seized power in 1999 when, as chief of Pakistan's army, he ousted elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a coup.
