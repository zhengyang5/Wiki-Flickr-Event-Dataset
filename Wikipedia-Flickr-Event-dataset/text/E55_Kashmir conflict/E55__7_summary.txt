There have been widespread charges of election-rigging in Kashmir which have plagued all the elections from 1951 till date.
Though it is true that election-rigging is not specific to the State of J&K and has taken place in elections elsewhere in India, it becomes necessary to analyze elections in Kashmir, given the fact that the Indian State continues to argue that such elections are a substitute for the promised plebiscite.
It is noteworthy that Mr. B.K.
Nehru, former Governor of J&K has acknowledged publicly that elections in Kashmir have indeed been rigged in the past.
