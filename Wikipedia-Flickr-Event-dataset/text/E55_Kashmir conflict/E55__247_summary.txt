PAMPORE: About 8km south of Srinagar, the road seems to end.
The men shout "azadi" and "Allah-u-Akbar" (God is great) in collective frenzy.
There's Jhelum on one side with thick groves lining the embankment; the other side is lush with paddy fields.
Another braveheart soon steals his thunder climbing the taller adjoining tower as "azadi" slogans fill the air.There are only two colours of flag on display.
Lakhs of people, with their own reasons to believe that "azadi" is the best choice for them.
