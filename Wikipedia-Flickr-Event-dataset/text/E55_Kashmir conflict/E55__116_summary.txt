The Rediff Special/ Arvind Lavakare Legality of Accession Unquestionable Kashmir: The Real Story T hough the Instrument of Accession executed on October 27, 1947 between the ruler of Kashmir and the Governor General of India was a legal act, Pakistan chose to refute it more than once almost from day one.
Thus, on November 1, 1948, in his meeting with Lord Mountbatten, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founder, claimed that the accession of Kashmir to India was based on violence.
The accession of Kashmir to India is a fraud, perpetrated on the people of Kashmir by its cowardly ruler with the aggressive help of the Indian government.'
Fraud, he says, is causing a person to do something by deceit, but 'there is no evidence of any deceit practised by India on Kashmir.'
Equally importantly, as will be proved later in this series, even Kashmiris approved of their state's accession to India.
