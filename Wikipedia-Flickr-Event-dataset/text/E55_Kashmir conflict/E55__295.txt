NEW DELHI: With Kashmir reportedly being excluded from the UN list of unresolved disputes, the US today said it was an "internal issue" of India and should be resolved bilaterally through negotiations with Pakistan."This is an internal issue for India. It is a bilateral issue between Pakistan and India, to discuss term, scope, character and pace," US Ambassador Timothy Roemer said.He was asked to comment on UN excluding Kashmir from list of unresolved international issues."The (US) President ( Barack Obama ), I think was very articulate on this issue of Kashmir. This is an internal issue for India," he said on the sidelines of a function here.Roemer noted that during his visit, Obama had said that he encouraged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and people of India to engage with the government and people of Pakistan.He underlined that whenever India and Pakistan talk, it will be at the "pace and character" of the two countries.On Obama announcing support for India's bid for permanent UNSC membership, he said the US will now work to realise the promise."We are very proud about President's announcement that he is unequivocally and fervently in favour of India having a permanent seat in a reformed United Nations. It was one of the many highlights of (his) visit to India..We will be working to see that happen," Roemer said.
