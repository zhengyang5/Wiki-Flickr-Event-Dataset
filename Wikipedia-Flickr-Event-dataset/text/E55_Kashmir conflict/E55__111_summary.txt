Shinwari's appointment was announced by the Al Qaeda's daawa (propagation) and media department, which is led by Ustad Ahmad Farooq.
According to the statement, Shinwari was approved as the leader after consultations among the Al Qaeda's top leadership and ratification by its commanders in Pakistan.
The Al Qaeda is believed to have chosen him because he is a native of Khyber Agency who is familiar with FATA and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's supply routes.
Shinwari was considered close to Mansoor, a key Al Qaeda figure, who had replaced Ilyas Kashmiri following his death in an American drone attack in June 2011.
Because of his closeness to Mansoor, Shinwari is believed to share a similar rapport with the Harkat-ul Mujahideen, Harkat-ul Jehadul Islami and the Tehrik-e-Taliban.
