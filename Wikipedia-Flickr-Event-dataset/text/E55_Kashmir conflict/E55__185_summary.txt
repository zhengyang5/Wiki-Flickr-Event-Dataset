Other cables show that as recently as 2007 American diplomats were concerned about widespread human rights abuses by Indian security forces, who they said relied on torture for confessions.
The embassy reported the ICRC concluded that India "condones torture" and that the torture victims were civilians as militants were routinely killed.
It claimed tens of thousands of lives, including large numbers of civilians who were targeted by both militants and security forces.
The abuse continued, they said, because "security forces need promotions," while for militants, "the insurgency has become a business".
The cables reveal a careful US policy of pressure in Kashmir, while maintaining a strictly neutral stance.
