P akistan's High Commissioner for India Ashraf Jehangir Qazi believes no ambassador or high commissioner can stay at his post if the host government wishes otherwise, and maintains that diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan have not been downgraded.
India has asserted that 'karni aur kathni mein antar hai' -- there is a difference between words and deeds -- and that for one positive step Pakistan takes, India will take two.
We are gratified that the general Indian reaction has been positive and the Indian external affairs minister has said his country will reciprocate our initiative.
India has also asked Pakistan to ban other terrorist groups and their parent organisations that are targeting India.
My government is not required to recall me just because the Indian high commissioner has been temporarily recalled.
