ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan looks forward to a new beginning in its bilateral relationship with the United States.
The situation in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India is indeed critical, but its severity actually presents an opportunity for aggressive and innovative action.
Assistance to Pakistan is not charity; rather, the creation of a politically stable and economically viable Pakistan is in the long-term, strategic interest of the United States.
The Obama administration should immediately encourage Congress to pass the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act.
Pakistan and the United States have much in common and should be partners in peace.
