NEW DELHI: Separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani Tuesday said Kashmir is an international issue and not an internal issue of India.



"First of all when they say Kashmir is an internal issue, it is against the reality. The issue of Jammu and Kashmir is an international issue and it should be solved," Geelani, who is in Delhi to meet Pakistan's high commissioner, told reporters at the airport.



"It is unfortunate that the Indian government has cancelled the (foreign secretary-level) talks," he said.



Geelani with other leaders of the moderate Hurriyat Conference will meet Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit in Delhi Tuesday.



"As long as promises made to us are not fulfilled, this issue will remain unsolved," said Geelani.



He said India is not trying to resolve the issue and suppressing it.



"India does not want to resolve the issue...It is using force to suppress it," he said.



Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said the Indian government has over reacted.



"New Delhi over reacted on the issue...There has to be a peaceful, political resolution to the Kashmir issue," Farooq told a news channel.



The Indian government Monday called off the Aug 25 foreign secretary-level talks, calling Pakistan's engagement with the Kashmiri separatist unacceptable.



India slammed it as a continued efforts to interfere in its internal affairs.
