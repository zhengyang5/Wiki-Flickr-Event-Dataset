SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir High Court has ruled that Article 370 , granting special status to the state, has assumed place of permanence in the Constitution and the feature is beyond amendment, repeal or abrogation.The Court also said that Article 35A gives "protection" to existing laws in force in the State.
"The limited sovereignty or special status stands guaranteed under Article 370 - the only provision of the Constitution that applied to the State on its own.
The only other Constitutional provision made applicable by Article 370 of the Constitution to the State is Article 1.
"Resultantly, Article 370, notwithstanding its title showing it a 'temporary provision' is a permanent provision of the Constitution.
"The Article 35A gives protection to existing laws in force in the State and to any law enacted after 1954 by the State legislature," it added.
