SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Authorities in Indian Kashmir will free jailed protesters and reduce the number of checkpoints in the main city Srinagar, a senior security official said on Wednesday.
Policemen stand guard as Kashmiri people shop inside a shop during a relaxation in curfew in Srinagar September 26, 2010.
The move was part of a federal government initiative to defuse tension in Kashmir, which has been in a siege-like state of strikes, protests and curfew for months, threatening to undermine rule from New Delhi.
Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, both of which claim the region in full.
Kashmiri separatists in India want to carve out an independent homeland or merge with predominantly Muslim Pakistan.
