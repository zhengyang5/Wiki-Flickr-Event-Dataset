Nirupama Subramanian"Militant infiltration into India continues"ISLAMABAD: The people of "Azad" Kashmir are anything but azad, or free, says Human Rights Watch (HRW) in a report on the situation in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).
The HRW also reports that militant infiltration across the Line of Control (LoC) into India continues though the levels have come down.
Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Tariq Azeem said the report was "biased and inaccurate" and contained "factual errors."
He said HRW collated the report with Indian researchers, and said the only Pakistani involved was Asma Jahangir, who is the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission.
"The Pakistani intelligence apparatus retains close associations with these groups," the 71-page report says.
