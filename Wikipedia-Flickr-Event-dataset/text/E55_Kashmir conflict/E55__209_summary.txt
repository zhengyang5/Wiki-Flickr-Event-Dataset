The lead in this act of ethnic cleansing was initially taken by the Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front and the Hizbul Mujahideen.
Within a few weeks of the outbreak of ethnic cleansing, a majority of Pandits found themselves reduced to the miserable status of refugees in their own country.
Neither V P Singh, who was the prime minister when the ethnic cleansing was carried out, nor any of his successors had the least idea of how to deal with the situation.
Since Kao's death in 2002, the Kashmiri Pandits find themselves orphaned.
Firstly, it is too late in the day to think of identifying and punishing those who were responsible for the ethnic cleansing.
