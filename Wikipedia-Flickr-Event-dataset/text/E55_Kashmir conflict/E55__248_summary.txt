Farooq Khan / EPA An Indian paramilitary soldier stands guard as Kashmiri Muslims stand in a queue to cast their votes outside a polling station in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir, 24, December, 2008.
Security was tight for the final phase of a staggered poll that will elect an 87-member Jammu and Kashmir Assembly to a six-year term.
Large numbers of voters in other regions appeared to follow suit in rejecting the boycott call.
India's Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee said recently in Srinagar, "It has been quite encouraging that a large number of people has come out to vote...
It is significantly higher [turnout] compared to the elections held in the past which is a very important development.
