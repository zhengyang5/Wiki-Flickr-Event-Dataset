New Delhi: The government today agreed to the opposition's demand for a debate on the violence in Kashmir over protests following Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani's killing on July 8.

"I stand here as a deeply hurt man, we haven't learnt our lesson in Kashmir," said Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, opening the debate.

"We are with the government in ending militancy but can't support this treatment of civilians. Can civilians be treated like militants?" he said.

In protests over past few days, over 40 have been killed in firing by security forces and 2,000 have been injured. Over 600 have pellet injuries and may lose their eyesight.

Kashmir has been under curfew for several days. Cellphone and internet services have been blocked in many parts of the state to prevent volatile rumours and newspapers have also been restricted.



Wani, 22, was the poster boy of new militancy in Kashmir, represented by young, educated boys from affluent families.
