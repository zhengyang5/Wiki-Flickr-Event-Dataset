Pakistan, India meet on KashmirNEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Indian Premier Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf met for two-and-half hours in a bid to negotiate a solution to the conflict in the disputed region of Kashmir.
After the two-and-half hour discussion, Singh and Musharraf left for a luncheon at Singh's house.
Musharraf and Singh attended a cricket game between Pakistan and India before their meeting.
India and Pakistan each control a section of Kashmir, which was divided in 1947 by a Line of Control.
There have been cross-border cultural exchanges, and earlier this month a bus route linking Pakistani-controlled Kashmir and Indian-controlled Kashmir resumed after more than five decades.
