The issue:What are the Northern Areas?
The Pakistan government approved a self-governance and reforms package for the Northern Areas which entails that the strategically-located Northern Areas will have rights akin to those of Pakistan's four provinces, (Punjab, Sind, NWFP, Balochistan).
The "Gilgit- Baltistan Empowerment and Self Governance Order 2009" also aims at giving the Northern Areas "full internal autonomy" and changing the region's name to Gilgit-Baltistan.
Under the new system, the Northern Areas will have a province-like status without actually being conferred such a status constitutionally.
Moreover, China has, through its links with the Northern Areas, become a part of the Kashmir problem.
