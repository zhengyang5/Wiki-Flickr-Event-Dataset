Kashmir, Gender and Militarization inIntroductionCompared to contemporary armed conflicts in the Balkans, Middle East, or West Africa, the conflict in Indian-administered Kashmir has received relatively little international attention.
[Note: For reasons of clarity and consistency this article uses Kashmir to refer to the Valley of Kashmir, also the location of the present conflict.
Ever since the outbreak of rebellion in 1990 there have been frequent reports of rape by security forces in Kashmir.
No legal proceeding can be instituted against security forces without prior permission from the central government, which is almost never forthcoming.
The overall context of militarization and repression makes it extremely difficult if not altogether impossible for Kashmiri women to articulate their concerns or take recourse to institutional channels of redress.
