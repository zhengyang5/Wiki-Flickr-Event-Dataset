Plebiscite abandonedBut in the 1950s, the Indian Government distanced itself from its commitment to hold a plebiscite.
Pakistan has consistently called for the issue to be resolved by means of a plebiscite and has blamed India for reneging on its pledge.
It is also now evident that holding a plebiscite that assumes Kashmir becomes a united state might not produce an equitable result, given its cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity.
To date, the Government of India has refused to reconsider the possibility of holding a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir.
Without, however, holding a plebiscite or referendum it is impossible to determine exactly what proportion of the people support which option.
