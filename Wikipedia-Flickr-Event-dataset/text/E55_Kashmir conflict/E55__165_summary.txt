NEW DELHI, May 29: British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw assured India on Wednesday that Pakistan was serious about ending the cross-border terrorism in Kashmir, as he held talks to defuse tensions between the nuclear-armed powers.
As heavy shelling pounded the disputed border in Kashmir, Straw said Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf genuinely wanted to stop what India calls “cross-border terrorism” in the Himalayan region.
But Singh again said India was growing impatient with Musharraf, despite the Pakistan leader’s statement this week that infiltration was not taking place.
In addition to the British and Japanese envoys, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Safonov visited Islamabad on Tuesday.
But the Indian foreign minister has ruled out such a meeting, saying there can be no dialogue with Pakistan until it shuts down “terrorism camps” in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.—AFP
