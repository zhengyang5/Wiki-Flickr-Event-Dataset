Image caption The issue of missing people in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked many demonstrations over the yearsRights group Human Rights Watch has urged India to hold an independent inquiry into the unmarked graves found in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Earlier, the state human right commission said it had evidence that 2,156 bodies had been buried in 40 graves over the last 20 years.
"For years, Kashmiris have been lamenting their lost loved ones, their pleas ignored or dismissed as the government and army claimed that they had gone to Pakistan to become militants," Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said.
Independent human rights groups have long insisted that thousands of people have mysteriously disappeared over the last two decades and never been accounted for.
They also say that many of the missing people have crossed into Pakistan-administered Kashmir to engage in militancy.
