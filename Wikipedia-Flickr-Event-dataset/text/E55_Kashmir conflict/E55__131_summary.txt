Facing flak for his remarks on accession of Jammu and Kashmir with India, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Friday got support from an unexpected quarter Â— senior Congress leader and former sadar-e-riyast Dr Karan Singh.
Singh said the state had acceded to India and not merged with it and that it why it has its own separate constitution and special status.
However, after that other states ended in merger with India, but Jammu Kashmir did not merge with it as it had its own separate constitution.
Referring to the state's position in India, Singh said the Union of India was a full-fledged state.
"In a big federal structure, you have different types of structures like states, Union Territories... J&K for historical reasons has been given a special position," Singh said.
