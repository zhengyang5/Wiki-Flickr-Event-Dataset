Under increasing domestic political pressure for a tough response to a deadly attack Saturday night in Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian government renewed its call today for the United States to declare Pakistan a terrorist state for failing to dismantle a ''terrorist infrastructure'' inside its borders.
A senior Indian official reported on Monday that the government had seen an increase in raids, radio traffic and activity in militant training camps in the Pakistani-controlled part of the disputed territory of Kashmir since late June.
In response, Deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani announced that he had recently told a senior American official that the United States should place Pakistan on its list of states supporting terrorism.
''If the U.S. wants,'' Mr. Advani said, ''it can stop terrorism and put an end to terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan by threatening that Washington would declare it a terrorist state.''
He did not identify the official, and American diplomats in New Delhi declined to comment on his request.
