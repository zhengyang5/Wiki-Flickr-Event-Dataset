The March 2000 encounter at Pathribal in Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of seven civilians was nothing but a cold-blooded murder and no sanction was required to prosecute the Army personnel involved in the incident.
This submission was made on Monday by senior counsel Ashok Bhan, who appeared for the CBI, before a Bench of Justices B.S.
Army personnel had shot dead seven alleged militants in the incident.
â€œNo sanction is required for prosecution of the accused after the CBI filed a charge sheet against the five officers in Srinagar.
He had been insisting that the CBI should first approach the Union government on the issue of sanction.
