Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was in London for surgery, in a statement expressed shock over Wani’s killing.
Since Wani’s killing, the situation in Kashmir has again turned from perceived normalcy to amplified instability, cracking the perception of “peace returns” with tens of thousands of people endorsing militancy.
Without using non-lethal weapons or showing restraint, Indian troops opened fire at civilians, killing 36 within five days.
Wani’s killing fanned the rage leading into the current crisis, proving that peace in Kashmir can only return by listening to people’s demands to exercise their right to self-determination.
Violence begets violence and soon many young boys may be inspired to follow in Wani’s path, seeking to lead Kashmir to a new political reality.
