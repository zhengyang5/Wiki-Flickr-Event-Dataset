The unexpected high voter turnout, this time has evoked considerable debate and analysis both in Kashmir and elsewhere.
Thus at the time of ‘Conditional Accession’ Jammu & Kashmir was the only state to declare its intention to have its own constitution, to be drafted by its own Constituent Assembly.
This is how the people of J & K have earned their right of ‘Self determination’ and right to vote for ‘Self Rule’.
If India is a true democracy, it must have the courage to face up to, and redress, its political failures in Kashmir.
