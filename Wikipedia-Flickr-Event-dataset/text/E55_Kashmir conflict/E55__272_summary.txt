ANALYSIS/OPINION:President-elect Barack Obama has made his first big foreign-policy mistake - pledging U.S. intervention in the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan.
As previous presidents who have toyed with intervention, Mr. Obama will learn, if he persists, that Kashmir is not a territorial issue.
Conversely, until Mr. Zardari became president, Pakistan gave Kashmir top priority to vindicate its creation as an Islamic state and its rejection of secularism.
Mr. Zardari often has been dismissed as a playboy incapable of coping with mounting economic and political problems.
The economic opening to India that Mr. Zardari advocates has become increasingly important for Pakistanâ€™s economic survival.
