SRINAGAR, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- Pro-India parties have won enough seats in the state assembly to form a ruling alliance in Indian-administered Kashmir, according to tallies announced Sunday.
The National Conference party and the Congress party together won 45 seats, one more than is needed for a simple majority in the 87-seat state assembly.
The National Conference party won 28 seats, and Congress won 17.
Before the elections, violent protests were conducted by anti-Indian groups, fearful state elections would firm up Indian control of the area, and by Indian nationalists, fearful that separatist groups would gain control.
