Image caption Few Kashmiris are optimistic over the chances for peaceA survey which a British academic says is the first systematic attempt to establish the opinions of Kashmiris has produced "striking results".
Robert Bradnock interviewed more than 3,700 people in Indian- and Pakistani-administered Kashmir to assess their views on various issues.
Dr Bradnock - an associate fellow at the Chatham House think-tank in London - says that the survey has produced startling conclusions, especially in relation to the future of the territory.
No 'simple fixes'It revealed that on average 44% of people in Pakistani-administered Kashmir favoured independence, compared with 43% in Indian-administered Kashmir.
"The results of the polls show that that there is no single proposition for the future of Kashmir which could be put to the population... and get majority support," he said.
