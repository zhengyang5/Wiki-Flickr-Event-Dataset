US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's suggestion in Delhi that al-Qaeda militants may be active in Kashmir dropped like a bombshell in Islamabad.
Pakistan's sympathy and support for the separatist movement and some of the militant groups fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir have never been a secret.
In such a situation, observers say, it is not in Pakistan's interest to allow any al-Qaeda members to operate from, or even find refuge in, Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
But a recent visit to Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, gave the impression the authorities were determined to stop encouraging a so-called "jihadi culture".
In such circumstances it is nearly impossible to imagine that al-Qaeda could operate easily from Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
