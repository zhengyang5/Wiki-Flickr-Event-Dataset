BJP questions PM's Kashmir autonomy remark

The BJP targeted the prime minister in Parliament on the issue and termed it as unfortunate.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has questioned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement on autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir, saying autonomy for the state won't be tolerated.

Reaching out the people of the state, Singh told a meeting of representatives of various political parties from the state in New Delhi that if there was a consensus between them on autonomy, the Centre would consider it within the ambit of the Constitution.

"We are all servants of the Constitution. There are many shades of opinion in various parts of Jammu and Kashmir. I and my senior ministers present here show our seriousness in addressing the issues," he said.

Prime Minister said that he was aware of the alienation of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and that it had to be removed. "Jammu and Kashmir residents must have a life of self-respect and dignity," he emphasized.
