Don't expect too much from talks: OfficialsRamananda Sengupta in New Delhi | June 27, 2004 15:23 ISTOfficials in New Delhi have warned against expecting any major breakthroughs at the two day talks between the foreign secretaries, which began on Sunday at Hyderabad House in New Delhi.
The 1997 composite dialogue formulation envisaged foreign secretary level talks for two subjects, Kashmir and peace and security.
This time, officials said the two sides are more likely to exchange pleasantries and discuss confidence building measures rather than any radical moves on Kashmir.
The Indian side will be led by foreign secretary Shashank, his successor designate Shyam Saran, and senior officials from the Pakistan desk.
So what should one expect from these talks?
