Srinagar, Sept 6: At least 300 protestors have been arrested by police in Indian Kashmir after the recent agitation and curfews.

Indian Kashmir witnessed massive anti-India and pro-freedom marches and rallies in August. Tens of thousands of people attended these marches and rallies, which called on India to grant freedom to Kashmir.

After the recent uprising, the police deployed in Indian Kashmir have registered more than 250 First Information Reports (FIRs) against the protestors, mostly youth. Police have detained more than 300 people for taking part in the freedom marches and rallies.

Police officials claimed that these arrests and FIRs were registered against the persons, who attacked the cops and damaged public property during the agitation in the Valley.

Sources said that at least three FIRs have been registered in each police station across Indian Kashmir. They said that on an average five persons were detained by a police station.

A top police officer while confirming the arrests and lodging of FIRs, “The arrests of people and registering of FIRs against them was necessary as the rioters had damaged police vehicles, public property and attacked cops and other government employees. Hundreds of FIRs have been registered in different police stations in the Kashmir against the persons, who defied law and attacked public and private properties”.
