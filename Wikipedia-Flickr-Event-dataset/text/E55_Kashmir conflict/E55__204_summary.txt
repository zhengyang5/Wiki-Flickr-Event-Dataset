GK News NetworkIn the begening, let me confess that 25 years having been passed-by since January 1990, rests heavily on my mind.
Agreed, in the life of a nations, a timeframe of 25 years hardly matters.
In Delhi, precisely last Saturday, I asked a very senior former Indian bureaucrat, how does he understand the passage of last 25 years, and ever evolving crisis in Kashmir?
And he continued, “Kashmir has moved-away from the violent days of 1990s; a confident new Kashmiri generation has appeared”.
25 years of struggle, consuming tens of thousands of precious lives and causing extensive destruction, has failed to produce a resolution of the conflict.
