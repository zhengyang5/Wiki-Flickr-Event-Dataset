"Our investigations have revealed it was a fake encounter and cold-blooded murders.
If public confidence in the rule of law and dispensation of justices is to be sustained, the accused officers deserve to be meted out exemplarypunishment," Bhan told the bench.
On the last hearing, the apex court had asked the Centre to convey its stand as to whether five officials, including a Major General, can be tried under the Army Act.
