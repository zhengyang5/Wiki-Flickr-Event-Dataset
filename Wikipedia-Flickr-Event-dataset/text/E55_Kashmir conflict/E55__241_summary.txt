Since July this year, more than 40 protesters, all unarmed, have been gunned down by Indian security forces in the beautiful but deeply troubled Kashmir Valley.
A tentative peace process between India and Pakistan has led to a decline in cross-border infiltration by Muslim fighters.
In the light of this heavy-handed treatment, the determination of ordinary protesters, separatist politicians and even militants to avoid armed retaliation is a remarkable development.
Most Kashmiri Muslim women wear colourful clothes, and are unveiled.
But with next door Pakistan increasingly under threat from pro-Taleban militants the Talibanisation of the Kashmiri separatist struggle can't be ruled out.
