A regional party is preparing to put together a coalition government in Indian Kashmir after no clear winner emerged in recent elections.
The Kashmir-based National Conference, which emerged as the single largest party in Jammu and Kashmir, has initiated talks with the Congress Party to cobble together a coalition government for the state.
The pro-India National Conference won 28 seats in the 87-member state assembly.
Both the National Conference and the Congress Party have called the results in Kashmir elections a "victory for democracy."
Kashmir's former Chief Minister and a leader of the Congress Party, Ghulam Nabi Azad, indicated his party is open to an alliance with the National Conference.
