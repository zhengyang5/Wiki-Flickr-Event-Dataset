It is for the reader to judge how sincere the two adversaries, India and Pakistan, were on holding a plebiscite; whether it was a still-born proposal or was killed shortly after its birth.
In 1947 Plebiscite in Kashmir was a democratic necessity as well as a moral imperative.
So was it in the case of Kashmir - which is why a plebiscite was never held.
It was then decided to accept the accession "subject to the proviso that a plebiscite would be held in Kashmir".
that we no longer stand by a referendum in Kashmir, Pakistan would score a strong point and that would be harmful to our cause.
