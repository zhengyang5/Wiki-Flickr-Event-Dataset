Kashmir is India's 'internal' issue: US envoyLast updated: 15 November, 2010New Delhi, Nov 15 (PTI) 19:42 ISTWith Kashmir reportedly being excluded from the UN list of unresolved disputes, the US today said it was an "internal issue" of India and should be resolved bilaterally through negotiations with Pakistan.
"This is an internal issue for India.
It is a bilateral issue between Pakistan and India, to discuss term, scope, character and pace," US Ambassador Timothy Roemer said.
"The (US) President (Barack Obama), I think was very articulate on this issue of Kashmir.
This is an internal issue for India," he said on the sidelines of a function here.
