Jayaprakash Narayan pulled no punches â€” not even when it concerned Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), where the repeated murder of democracy made even the most fair-minded people look the other way.
The Bharatiya Jana Sangh had launched an agitation against him that triggered a chain reaction which led to his downfall.
The credibility of electoral processes and democratic institutions as such has always been suspect in J&K.
But it would take more than just rhetoric for the electorate to shed the baggage associated with the BJP.
The party after all has been hitherto known in Kashmir for its aggressive yatras to push nationalism down Kashmiri throats.
