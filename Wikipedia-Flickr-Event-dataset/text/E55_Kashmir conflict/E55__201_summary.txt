Replying to a question from People's Democratic Party member Syed Basharat Bukhari, Revenue Minister Raman Bhalla told the Assembly in Jammu that “219 Pandits were killed in Kashmir from 1989 to 2004.
From 2004, no killing of any person from the community [Kashmiri Pandits] took place till now,” Mr. Bhalla said.
A total number of 38,119 families comprising 1,42,042 Kashmiri migrants were registered with the Revenue and Relief Ministry till now.
“Under this scheme, 3,000 supernumerary posts have been created, exclusively for the Kashmiri migrants, willing to return to the Valley.
But, despite all these rehabilitation packages, not a single Kashmiri migrant has returned to the Valley, the Minister rued.
