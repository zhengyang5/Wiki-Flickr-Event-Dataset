Foreign Minister of Pakistan, on the role of the Security Council in the Pacific Settlement of DisputesBy H.E.
The Charter charged the Security Council with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.
We have a long and abiding association with the Security Council in this regard.
It was intensified when the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir was referred to the Security Council.
These assets of legitimacy, credibility and acceptability must be more vigorously utilized by the Security Council to prevent armed conflicts and to settle disputes peacefully.
