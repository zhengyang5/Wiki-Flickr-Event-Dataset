Srinagar, Oct 15: Army has made it clear that Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) is not empowered to investigate alleged human rights violations against its soldiers posted in the State.
30 RR the unit alleged to have used civilian for forced labour was inducted into J&K in March 1995.
“This is more than seven years after the period of their being allegedly used for forced labour.
Constituted in 1997, the SHRC is governed by Jammu and Kashmir Protection of Human Rights Act 1997.
The argument of the Army that SHRC doesn’t have jurisdiction over human rights allegations against its soldiers is totally wrong.
