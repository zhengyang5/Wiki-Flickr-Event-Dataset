Addressing large crowds, Mr Vajpayee accused Pakistan of renewed cross-border attacks in Kashmir, and said it was trying to open up new fronts with India.
"I assure the countrymen that the neighbours will not be allowed to succeed in their attempts," Mr Vajpayee told supporters in the industrial town of Ludhiana.
