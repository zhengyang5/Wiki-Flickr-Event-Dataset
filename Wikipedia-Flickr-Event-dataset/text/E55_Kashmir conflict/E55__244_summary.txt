SRINAGAR, Sept 7: Kashmir’s top leader has warned that India’s heavy-handed crackdown on protests could trigger a renewed violent upsurge in the long-running freedom struggle.
“We will continue to fight peacefully and politically,” Farooq told AFP in an interview, which had to be conducted by telephone because he is under house arrest.
“Unless and until the basic issue (of Kashmir’s future) is addressed, you cannot ever say that the Kashmir issue is dead or that people have forgotten what happened in the past,” he said.
They said Indian soldiers also killed three suspected militants late on Saturday when they tried to sneak into occupied Kashmir from the Azad Kashmir.
