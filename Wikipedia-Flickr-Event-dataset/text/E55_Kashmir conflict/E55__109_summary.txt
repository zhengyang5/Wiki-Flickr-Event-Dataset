Al Qaeda could provoke new India-Pakistan war: GatesWednesday, 20 Jan, 2010US Defence Secretary Robert Gates addresses the media in New Delhi on January 20, 2010.
– AFPNEW DELHI: Al Qaeda is seeking to de-stabilise the entire South Asia region and could trigger a war between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates told reporters on Wednesday.
Gates cited three main groups operating under Al-Qaeda's “umbrella,” the Taliban forces fighting in Afghanistan, Taliban elements targeting Pakistan's government and the Islamist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in Pakistan focused on India.
“I think it's not unreasonable to assume India patience would be limited were there to be further attacks,” he said.
Gates described India as a vital partner in the struggle against extremist threats, expressed appreciation for its economic aid to Afghanistan and said that he discussed how to bolster US-India military cooperation.
