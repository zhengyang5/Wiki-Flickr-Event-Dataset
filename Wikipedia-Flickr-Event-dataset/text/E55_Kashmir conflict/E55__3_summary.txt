Despite bone-chilling cold, good turnout was witnessed at the Republic day functions at various district headquarters in the Valley, officials said.
“The Republic Day celebrations have concluded across Kashmir peacefully with no untoward incident reported from anywhere in the Valley,” a senior police officer said.
Unlike earlier, authorities had allowed uninterrupted mobile services on Republic Day last year.
