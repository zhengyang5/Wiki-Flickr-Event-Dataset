ISLAMABAD: In the wilderness for a long time, former military ruler General Pervez Musharraf made an anti-India rant by saying Pakistan needs to "incite" those "fighting" in Kashmir.
"We have source (in Kashmir) besides the (Pakistan) army...People in Kashmir are fighting against (India).
We just need to incite them," the 71-year-old retired general, who is currently on bail in a treason case, told a TV channel.
"In Kashmir, we can fight with the (Indian) army from both the front and back...We are Muslims.
Currently, he is on bail in four criminal cases while the treason case is going on in a special tribunal.
