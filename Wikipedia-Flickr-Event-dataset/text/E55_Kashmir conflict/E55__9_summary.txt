Historical records demonstrate that elections in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir have never been free and fair.
Fraudulently, India had forced Sheikh Abdullah, President of the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, to declare accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to India.
Since then, the people of Kashmir have overwhelmingly boycotted Indian organised elections conducted under the barrel of the gun.
The September 1996 elections were again massively boycotted: â€œThe people of the Kashmir valley are not in favour of elections.
Unfortunately, the authorities in Jammu and Kashmir State have not helped matter by clumsily having soldiers force voters into poll booths.
