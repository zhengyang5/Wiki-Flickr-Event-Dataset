The entire game is being played by masters sitting in New Delhi, and the rulers here are merely meant to act as a front,” he said.He said that a “Quit Jammu Kashmir” would be launched on Friday with the single slogan of “Go India, Go.”“It is better to die together than to be killed one by one, but there will be no compromise on the movement,” he said.Describing the district development commissioner for Srinagar as a ‘rubber stamp” Aalam said that the officer had sent Aasiya Andrabi and an 18-year-old girl to a jail outside the state under the PSA.
