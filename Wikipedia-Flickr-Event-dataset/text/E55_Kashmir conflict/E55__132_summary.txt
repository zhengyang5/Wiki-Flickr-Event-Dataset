Only 3 percent of the mainly Muslim inhabitants of the city think Kashmir should become part of Pakistan, and 7 percent prefer Indian rule, the poll said.
But down in Jammu, the state’s mainly Hindu winter capital in the plains to the south, 95 percent think Kashmir should be part of India.
Both countries claim the region in full, and both have ruled out independence as an option.
Delhi’s Centre for the Study of Developing Societies interviewed 226 people in Srinagar and 255 in Jammu for the poll, published in Monday’s Indian Express.
Another 47 percent of Pakistanis said they supported independence for Kashmir.
