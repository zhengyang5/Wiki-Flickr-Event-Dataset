The European Parliament has asked member nations to minimise financial aid to Pakistan until it successfully eradicates terrorist groups functioning from its soil.
The parliament also expressed concern over the situation in Gilgit Baltistan and asked Pakistan to "give full representative democracy and freedom to the people of Gilgit Baltistan and hold in abeyance the EU Empowerment and Self-Governance Order 2009."
The declaration appealed to the European Commission to minimise its financial aid to Pakistan, "until Pakistan succeeds to eradicate the terrorist groups functioning from its soil".
It also asked Pakistan to invite a representative of the European Union to undertake a study of the region.
"Such representative shall be nominated by the EU in consultation with the European Parliament," it said.
