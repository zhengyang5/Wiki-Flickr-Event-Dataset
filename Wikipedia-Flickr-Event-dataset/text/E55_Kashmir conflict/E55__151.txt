ISLAMABAD: In the wilderness for a long time, former military ruler General Pervez Musharraf made an anti-India rant by saying Pakistan needs to "incite" those "fighting" in Kashmir.

"We have source (in Kashmir) besides the (Pakistan) army...People in Kashmir are fighting against (India). We just need to incite them," the 71-year-old retired general, who is currently on bail in a treason case, told a TV channel.

Musharraf, who had grabbed power in 1999 soon after the Kargil conflict, said the army is ready for war (with India) and lakhs of people in Pakistan are willing to go and fight for Kashmir. India should not be under the illusion that Pakistan will not hit back, he added.

"In Kashmir, we can fight with the (Indian) army from both the front and back...We are Muslims. We will not show the other cheek when we are slapped. We can respond tit for tat," he said, while commenting on the recent firing along the Line of Control and International Border.

He said external aggression happens only when the country remains internally weak. "If we remain strong internally, no one can dare to target us."

Musharraf also said (Narendra) "Modi is anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan. He has not changed. The problem is with us... We are running to attend his (Modi) inauguration, we should keep our dignity."

The former president also termed the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) granted to Pakistan by India as "a joke".

Musharraf, who was forced to resign in 2008 after his supporters lost, returned to Pakistan in 2013 after over four years of self-exile but faces a slew of cases.

Currently, he is on bail in four criminal cases while the treason case is going on in a special tribunal.
