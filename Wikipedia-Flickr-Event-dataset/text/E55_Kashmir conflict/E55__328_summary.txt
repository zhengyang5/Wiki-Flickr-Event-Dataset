Zeenews BureauSrinagar: Less than half of residents of Kashmir favour independence as a solution to end unrest in the region and only two per cent of them want to join Pakistan if given an option, a survey said on Friday.
Conducted by British academic Robert Bradnock, the independent survey found that 44 percent of people in Pakistani occupied Kashmir favour independence, and 43 percent on the Indian side Kashmir.
"Any solution will depend on the Indian and Pakistani governmentsâ€™ commitment to achieving a permanent settlement," Bradnock said.
But in the Jammu region, support for independence dwindled to less than one percent.
The survey found that the "overwhelming majority" of people wanted a solution to the dispute, even though there were no "simple fixes".
