Â£INDIA@Torture continues in Jammu and Kashmir"The brutality of torture in Jammu and Kashmir defies belief.
The severity of torture meted out by the Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir is the main reason for the appalling number of deaths in custody"Despite denials by the Indian government, Amnesty International believes that torture continues to be widespread in Jammu and Kashmir.
To date, Amnesty International continues to be refused access to Jammu and Kashmir to carry out investigations into allegations of human rights violations.
Denied this possibility, Amnesty International has cross-checked the reports to the best of its ability and only relied on sources from within India.
Amnesty International calls on the government to order prompt independent and impartial investigations into these and all reports of torture in Jammu and Kashmir.
