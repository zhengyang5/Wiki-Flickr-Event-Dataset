Reliable sources told Greater Kashmir that Wajahat, who was the first CIC at the Centre, has conveyed his displeasure to Omar Abdullah over the “disempowerment” of the State Information Commission (SIC) by the state government.
Pertinently, Jammu and Kashmir Government, in a surprising move, last month repealed the RTI Rules-2010 and replaced them with feeble RTI Rules-2012, triggering widespread consternation among the public and the stakeholders.
Majority of the old State Rules were framed by GAD on the suggestions of Wajahat and other noted legal experts and RTI activists.
Since its constitution, SIC has passed some landmark judgments and was considered most successful institution of public transparency and accountability.
