Abrogation Of Article 370 Not PossibleBy Justice Rajindar Sachar20 May, 2014Countercurrents.orgBJP president Rajnath Singh has called for a debate on why Article 370 of the Constitution should not be abrogated.
One wishes he had sought this enlightenment before including the provocative item of abrogation of Article 370 in the BJP election manifesto.
In that view Article 370 cannot be withdrawn by Parliament purporting to exercise the power of amendment given by Article 368.
There is also nothing very special in laying this limitation in Article 370.
Faced with this reality, politicians must realise that all talk of abrogation of Article 370 is moonshine and a non-issue.
