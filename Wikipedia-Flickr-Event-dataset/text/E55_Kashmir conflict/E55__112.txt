The BJP has criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s statement on autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir and said autonomy for the state was not an option.

The BJP in Parliament on Wednesday said it was unfortunate that the autonomy debate had been reignited.

Party MP Yogi Adityanath said such announcements help terrorists,separatists and lower the morale of the security forces.

Party leader Venkaiah Naidu said: Whatever is possible within the constitution without compromising the sovereignty of India and without comprising on Kashmir being apart of India,BJP is open to discussion on any other issue.

On Tuesday,the Prime Minister had said the Centre was ready to consider the demand for autonomy if political parties were unanimous on the issue and that it was within the ambit of the Constitution.

Singh had appealed to the people of Kashmir to shun violence and said he can feel the pain and understand the anger and frustration that is bringing young people out on the streets of Kashmir. Singh had called for an end to the cycle of violence and said he was willing to work out a political devolution package within the ambit of the constitution if there was a consensus on autonomy.
