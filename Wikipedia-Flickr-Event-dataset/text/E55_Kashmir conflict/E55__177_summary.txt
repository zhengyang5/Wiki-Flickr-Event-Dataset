The statement said that the Indian State has worked towards building structures of violence and impunity.
In Jammu and Kashmir, 70,000+ killings, 8000+ enforced disappearances, mass torture and sexual violence, a majority committed by the armed forces, has resulted in zero prosecutions of armed forces personnel in civilian courts.
“Despite evidence, there have been no prosecutions in these cases, as the government through all its institutions is ensuring impunity for the culpable officials.”The reason for this absolute impunity, the statement said, is due to the fact that many senior officials – political, military and police are individually and collectively responsible for the crimes.
In any case, the people of Jammu and Kashmir, urge the international community to institute a similar mechanism to investigate the crimes perpetrated institutionally and systematically in Jammu and Kashmir.
In any future credible investigation, the role of Governors of Jammu and Kashmir from Jagmohan to N. N. Vohra, Chief Ministers like Farooq Abdullah, Mufti Sayed, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Omar Abdullah and most importantly the people at the helm of affairs of the Indian army and the overall military apparatus, like the Prime Ministers and the Home Ministers of India will definitely come under scrutiny.”
