Paying ministers nothing new in J&K, former Army chief Gen VK Singh saysIn an interview to Times Now, Singh said "paying ministers" was nothing new in J&K.
NEW DELHI: Reacting to accusations that he had funded a J&K politician to topple chief minister Omar Abdullah's government, former Army chief General VK Singh on Monday said those who levelled these allegations were anti-nationals as Army had to pay ministers in the border state "to bring people together".
Those who are accusing (of toppling the state government) have an agenda," Gen Singh said.
Gen Singh also denied that TSD had any snooping instrument and that it was purely human intelligence and not snooping on any politician.
On allegations of an attempt to change the line of succession in the Army and frustrate the chance of Gen Bikram Singh to become Army chief after him, VK Singh said had that been his purpose, the establishment under him would have changed the stance the Army had taken in courts on the fake encounter case.
