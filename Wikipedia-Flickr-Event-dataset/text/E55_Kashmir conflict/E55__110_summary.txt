Ilyas Kashmiri had planned to attack COASIlyas Kashmiri had planned to attack COASLAHORE: The reported death of the Ameer of the Azad Kashmir chapter of the Harkatul Jehadul Islami (HUJI) Commander Ilyas Kashmiri in a US drone attack on September 7 has confirmed that the trouble-stricken Waziristan region has become the new battlefield for the Kashmiri militant groups, which are increasingly joining forces with the pro-Taliban elements to fight out the Nato troops from Afghanistan.
Ilyas Kashmiri was considered to be one of the most dangerous al-Qaeda-linked Pakistani commanders.
While the Pakistan chapter of HUJI is led by Qari Saifullah Akhtar, its Azad Kashmir chapter, which is autonomous, was headed by Ilyas Kashmiri.
However, according to the Pakistani militant circles, Kashmiri was released upon the intervention of the United Jehad Council (UJC).
In May 2009, Ilyas Kashmiri was accused of plotting the assassination of Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, in collusion with al-Qaeda, largely because of the COASâ€™s lead role in the ongoing war against terrorism.
