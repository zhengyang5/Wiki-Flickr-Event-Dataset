more-inPakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence secretly pumped millions of dollars into a United States-based non-governmental organisation to influence politicians and opinion-makers on the Kashmir issue, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has said.
The Justice Department has also charged a second man, Zaheer Ahmad, with recruiting dummy donors for the KAC, through whom the ISI routed the funds.
Part of the funds routed to the KAC, Congressional records show, were used to directly influence key politicians.
Both major parties in the U.S. received donations from Dr. Fai, as did President Barack Obama's campaign.
The funds were also used to hold conferences attended by prominent figures from the U.S., India and Pakistan.
