Under increasing domestic political pressure for a tough response to a deadly attack Saturday night in Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian government renewed its call today for the United States to declare Pakistan a terrorist state for failing to dismantle a ''terrorist infrastructure'' inside its borders.

A senior Indian official reported on Monday that the government had seen an increase in raids, radio traffic and activity in militant training camps in the Pakistani-controlled part of the disputed territory of Kashmir since late June. Another attack wounded at least 13 people today in Anantnag, Kashmir.

The attacks and the Indian reaction threaten the hard-won period of calm between the nuclear-armed foes, which still have troops massed along their common border. The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell are both expected to try to foster dialogue between the countries during visits to the region in the next two weeks.

The injuries today in Anantnag, 35 miles south of Srinagar, were caused by the explosion of a grenade on a crowded street. Last Saturday, 27 people were killed in an attack by suspected Islamic militants near Jammu.

During a lengthy debate in Parliament today, opposition leaders accused the government of having no policy to halt the attacks. In response, Deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani announced that he had recently told a senior American official that the United States should place Pakistan on its list of states supporting terrorism. ''If the U.S. wants,'' Mr. Advani said, ''it can stop terrorism and put an end to terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan by threatening that Washington would declare it a terrorist state.'' He did not identify the official, and American diplomats in New Delhi declined to comment on his request.
