Rubbish! Indian policy under the tutelage of it's sponsor has been to reconstruct history - How? The issue of Kashmir is in essence a conflict between Pakistan and India arising out of 1947 -- the issue can only be resolved by negotiations between Pakistan and India.



However, India are, at least publicly indicated that it is not open to such discussions -- the new twist is to use the issue of terrorism to further distance India from the possibility of negotiations - or to demand that the results of any negotiations come before the negotiations themselves - doing a Israel, if you will.



Will it work? Certainly in the US and in India -- will it work for the captive Kashmiri and Pakistan? I don't see how.
