Of these, 21,323 are militants, 13,226 civilians killed by militants, 3,642 civilians killed by security forces, and 5,369 policemen killed by militants.
The 21,323 militants were killed in operations by security forces and include both Kashmiri and foreign militants.
And of the 5,369 members of the security forces, around 1,500 are Kashmiri policemen.The government has collated the figures of civilians killed by security forces since 1990: it lists 3,642 people.
The civilians killed fall into a black hole that Kashmiri society never discusses, remembers or protests against.
Where even people who are victims of militant violence are more comfortable talking about security forces and their atrocities.These figures are from the government.
