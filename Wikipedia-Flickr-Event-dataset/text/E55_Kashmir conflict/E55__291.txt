United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan says he has been encouraged by talks with Indian and Pakistani officials on seeking a settlement in Kashmir.

... the only way out is through dialogue, the only way out is through negotiations

"I am encouraged by the discussion in which your foreign minister has also said that the only way out is through dialogue, the only way out is through negotiations," Mr Annan told reporters.

But despite the optimism, his visit has been largely overshadowed by India's continuing political crisis, sparked by allegations of widespread high-level corruption.

Despite India's recent extension of a unilateral ceasefire in the troubled region, violence involving security forces and Muslim militants has escalated.

The issue has been high on Mr Annan's agenda during his tour of Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and India.

Outrage at Taleban

But any progress on Kashmir has been overshadowed by other issues.

In Pakistan, the focus shifted to his meetings with Taleban leaders as the international community expressed outrage about the destruction of priceless Buddhist statues and artefacts.

In Delhi, it happened again.

The UN chief arrived amid deepening political turmoil in the country, sparked by an undercover investigation by website reporters posing as arms dealers.

Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's ruling coalition has been under pressure since the website released secretly filmed video footage of senior officials taking cash in connection with a bogus arms deal.

The corruption scandal has already forced several dramatic resignations, including that of Defence Minister George Fernandes on Thursday.

Analysts say his departure could have been an attempt to limit the political damage, but so far there is little sign of that.

Mr Annan was forced to cancel a planned visit to parliament, which was adjourned for a fourth day after angry opposition members called on the government to resign.
