“These guys showed no remorse,” said the Pakistani official.
But Indian officials and other skeptics are sure to question how seriously interrogations by Pakistani security officials could be expected to examine any possible role by the ISI in the attacks.
However, an active member of Lashkar said in an interview that relations with Pakistani security forces had grown cold.
Despite the official assurances, some Pakistani officials appeared open to the idea that Pakistani militants carried out the operation.
One reason that Indian government officials have refused to provide substantive evidence so far, the Pakistani official said, is because they “are scared their intelligence methods will be discovered” by their Pakistani rivals.
