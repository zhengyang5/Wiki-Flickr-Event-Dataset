India retained most of the Kashmir Valley, along with Jammu and Ladakh.
However, after the talks broke down and a summit held in 2001 failed to resolve India and Pakistan's differences over Kashmir, militants again stepped up their attacks.
In July 2008, violence broke out in Kashmir when the Indian government rescinded a gift of protected forestland given to Hindu Pilgrims.
Courts were regularly in session in Jammu and Kashmir in 2008, according to the U.S. State Department's human rights report.
