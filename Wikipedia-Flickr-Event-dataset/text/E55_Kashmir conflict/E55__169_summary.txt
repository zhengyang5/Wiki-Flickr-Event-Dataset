Links between ISI, militant groups: StrawThe British government has said there is a 'clear link' between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence and three major militant outfits, Lashkar-e-Tayiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen operating in Jammu and Kashmir.
"Terrorism (from across the border) has had the covert support of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISID), the main intelligence agency in Pakistan," British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, told the House of Commons on Monday.
"Her Majesty's government accepts that there is a clear link between ISID and these groups -- Lashkar-e-Tayiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harakat Mujahideen -- which have been proscribed in Britain," he said.
