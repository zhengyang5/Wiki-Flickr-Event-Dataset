Low expectations from Indo-Pak talksRamananda Sengupta in New Delhi | June 26, 2004 15:27 ISTOfficials in New Delhi have warned against expecting any major breakthroughs at the two-day talks between the foreign secretaries which begin on Sunday at Hyderabad House in New Delhi.
This will the first time since 1997 that India and Pakistan will actually discuss Kashmir at any forum.
The 1997 composite dialogue formulation envisaged foreign secretary-level talks on two subjects, Kashmir and peace and security.
But the talks ended inconclusively, with India speaking of terrorism in Kashmir, and Pakistan describing it as a human rights issue.
"Pakistan wants to include 'the people of Kashmir' in the talks at some stage, but we differ over who really represents the real Kashmiri people and their locus-standi in the talks," he said.
