‘Real migration made thrice by Muslims of the Valley; there has been no discussion on it’Talking to reporters at a press conference, Rashid said the Pandits had ‘forced the migration on themselves’.
“The world knows that Pandits themselves left, and their migration was a well-planned strategy to exterminate Muslims from the Valley.
The plan was to keep Muslims alone, bulldoze them freely and return back to capture their properties (sic),” Rashid said, adding that instead of staying with Muslims, they (Pandits) left them to be killed.
Rashid also said that the ‘real migration’ was made three times by Muslims of the Valley and there has been no discussion on it.
Rashid, who accused the Pandits of defaming Muslims, said they have been working as stooges of New Delhi in Kashmir for defaming Muslims and diverting efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue.
