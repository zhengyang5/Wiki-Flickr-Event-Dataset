(New York) - The Indian government must thoroughly investigate and prosecute members of the security forces responsible for the extrajudicial execution of a carpenter and two laborers in Jammu and Kashmir, Human Rights Watch said today.
Two other deaths mentioned during the interrogation are also being investigated by Jammu and Kashmir police.
“This epidemic of fake ‘encounter killings’ by the security forces has plagued Kashmir for too long,” said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
In September 2006, Human Rights Watch released a report, “‘Everyone Lives in Fear’: Patterns of Impunity in Jammu and Kashmir,” calling on the state and national governments to investigate the problem of fake encounter killings and hold appropriate officials responsible.
“Human rights abuses and the failure of justice create despair in the valley and continue to fuel the conflict.”
