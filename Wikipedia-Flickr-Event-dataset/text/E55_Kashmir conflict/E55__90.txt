Amnesty International last week accused security forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir of exploiting a law that enables them to hold tens of thousands of prisoners without trial. The group argues that the Public Safety Act, which allows security to detain individuals for as many as two years without presenting charges, violates prisonersâ€™ human rights. Amnesty reports that hundreds of new prisoners are being arrested and detained each year under the law. Control of Kashmir, the disputed region divided between China, India, and Pakistan, has sparked two full-scale wars and countless skirmishes between Islamabad and Delhi. Amnesty is calling for Kashmiri officials to repeal the law and release prisoners held illegally, and for India to investigate reports of detainee abuse and torture.
