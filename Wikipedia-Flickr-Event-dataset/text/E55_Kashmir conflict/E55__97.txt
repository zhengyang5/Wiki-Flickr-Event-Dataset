A mission of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) visited India and Pakistan, and both the Indian and Pakistani controlled sections of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, from 16 to 30 August 1993.

The members of the ICJ mission were: Sir William Goodhart QC (United Kingdom), Dr. Dalmo Dallari (Brazil), Ms Florence Butegwa (Uganda), and Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn (Thailand), all distinguished jurists, chosen for their integrity, learning, and independence of mind.

The impetus for the appointment of the mission came from the concern felt by the ICJ over the reports of human rights abuses committed in the course of the current disturbances in Jammu and Kashmir. These disturbances, which are centred in the Valley of Kashmir, began in 1988.

By the end of 1989 they had become, in effect, a low-level civil war which has continued with no great change of intensity up to the present day, and which has cost several thousand lives.
