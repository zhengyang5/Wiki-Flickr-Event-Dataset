A Comprehensive Note on Jammu & KashmirTHE NORTHERN AREASThe Northern Areas have no status.
They are ruled directly from Islamabad through a Northern Areas Council which is headed by PakistanÂ’s Minister for Kashmir Affairs.
The Northern Areas Council is headed by the Minister of Kashmir and Northern Areas and meets only when the minister convenes it.
The Northern Areas are a story of deprivation of a people and their land devoid of any development and denial of basic fundamental rights.
The Northern Areas have not had the benefit of any legislature or legislative representation for decades.
