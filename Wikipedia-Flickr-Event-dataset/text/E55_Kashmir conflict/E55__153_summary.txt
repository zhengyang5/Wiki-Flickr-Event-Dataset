Is the Act of 1967 constitutionally valid in so far as it forbids the plea of plebiscite in or independence of Kashmir?
The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 applies Article 253 to Kashmir with one overriding proviso.
As late as the end of 1953 India and Pakistan were negotiating a plebiscite in Kashmir.
And she or he would be perfectly within her or his constitutional rights in advocating a plebiscite, however, wrong-headedly.
The people of Kashmir are very much a party to the Kashmir dispute.
