Washington, Aug 6 (ANI): Scientists have labelled the new U.S. government report that claims it has taken care of the gulf oil spill as 'ludicrous'.
Experts are also warning that majority of the oil is trapped under Gulf beaches and could remain there for years.
A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) report has claimed 33 percent oil has been burned, skimmed, dispersed, or directly recovered by cleanup operations.
But scientists argue that fluid nature of the ocean means that it's "exceedingly hard" to track oil.
For instance, the report considers all submerged oil to be dispersed and therefore not harmful, but that's not the case.
