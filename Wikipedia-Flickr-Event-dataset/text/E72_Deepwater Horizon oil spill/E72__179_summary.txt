PCCC founder Adam Green described the new oil-spill push as a message to the government on chemical exposures in the Gulf.
A New Orleans meeting of the National Academies' Institute of Medicine last month brought similar warnings from academics and physicians about the unknown health consequences facing Gulf workers and residents.
The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), however, has cited its chemical monitoring results in stating that most Gulf workers do not need respirators.
The dangers of heat stress can cause negative symptoms of their own and may be exacerbated by the use of heavy respiratory protection, OSHA officials have said.
Guidry said members of the burn team are not receiving respiratory protection because BP is "extremely hesitant to say this is a dangerous situation."
