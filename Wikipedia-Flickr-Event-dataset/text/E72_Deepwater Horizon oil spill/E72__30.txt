[Updated at 1:43 p.m.] An oil rig that has been burning in the Gulf of Mexico has sunk, said Lt. Cmdr. Cheri Ben-Iesau of the U.S. Coast Guard.

[Posted at 10:50 a.m.] The U.S. Coast Guard resumed its aerial search Thursday morning for 11 people missing after a "catastrophic" explosion aboard an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, an agency spokeswoman said.

The rig was still ablaze Thursday morning as a plane and helicopter rejoined rescuers' search for survivors of Tuesday night's explosion, Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashley Butler said.

Butler said oil was leaking from the rig at the rate of about 8,000 barrels of crude per day. The Coast Guard is also preparing for possible leaks of up to 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel, she said, but can do little to protect the environment until the fire is out.

An investigation was underway to determine what caused the blast aboard the rig Deepwater Horizon, which occurred about 10 p.m. (11 p.m. ET) Tuesday.

The mobile rig was about 52 miles southeast of Venice, Louisiana when the explosion occurred, said Coast Guard Senior Chief Petty Officer Mike O'Berry.

"It obviously was a catastrophic event," O'Berry said.

There were no indications it was a terrorist incident, the Coast Guard said.
