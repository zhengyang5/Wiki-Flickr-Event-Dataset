The university told STV Tony Hayward was "a role model" who had "made a huge contribution to the oil and gas industry" as it made him a Doctor of Technology.
Dr Hayward resigned as CEO of BP in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.
The disaster was the worst offshore oil spill ever seen in the United States.
Tony Hayward presided over the world's largest oil spill but continually played down its significance and trivialised the deaths of 11 people."
A spokesman for Greenpeace added: â€œMaking the man who was in charge during the Deepwater Horizon disaster a Doctor of Technology is like awarding the captain of the Exxon Valdez a honorary degree in Maritime Navigation.
