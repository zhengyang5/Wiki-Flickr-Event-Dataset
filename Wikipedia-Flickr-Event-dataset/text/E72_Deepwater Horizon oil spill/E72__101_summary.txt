Dispersants are a common product used to clean and control oil spills in the ocean.
They are special fluid chemicals that bond to the oil molecules and separate them from water molecules, thus breaking up the oil.
Dispersants are usually used on the surface of the ocean and distributed by aircraft flying over an oil spill.
Experts say dispersants, while toxic, are much less toxic than oil.
But some experts, including Ken Rosenberg of Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology, say dispersants still pose a problem for the environment.
