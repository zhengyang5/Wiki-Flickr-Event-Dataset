Nicolas Cage Gets Serious About the BP Oil Spill In the The Runner Trailerhttps://medium.com/media/c5fc069ead63e83e527b5b7898c347e1/hrefWhen was the last time you took Nicolas Cage seriously?
Well, he’s back in Louisiana in a new movie where he looks like he’s trying.
This one, titled The Runner, is set during the aftermath of the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
In The Runner, Cage plays a congressman representing people affected by the spill.
It is also the first of the non-documentary BP oil spill movies to arrive, the other being Deepwater Horizon, due next year.
