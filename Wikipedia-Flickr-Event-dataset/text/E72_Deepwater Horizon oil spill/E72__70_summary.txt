Schumaker has flown scientists from NASA, USGS, and oil chemistry scientists to observe conditions resulting from BP’s oil disaster that began in April 2010.
On August 18 reports surfaced that a large swath of oil sheen was reported near the site of last year's oil disaster.
He explained that the samples were analysed and compared to "the known Macondo oil fingerprint, and it was a very, very close match."
BP’s Gulf of Mexico disaster is, to date, the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry.
Reports of slicks that meander for kilometres and huge expanses of oil sheen that look like phantom islands are becoming common again."
