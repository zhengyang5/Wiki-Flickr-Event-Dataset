"We expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used," Jackson said in May.
Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant Corexit.
Gulf Coast environmentalists say it's another sign that the federal agencies monitoring dispersant use are not being tough enough with BP.
The highest recorded amount of dispersant used occurred on May 23, when 70,000 gallons were injected into the Gulf of Mexico.
But the struggle over daily dispersant use has caught the eye of Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, one of the loudest critics of BP's response in cleaning up the oil spill.
