Admiral to check on Gulf oil response in person; visit comes as oil washes ashore in Miss.
The admiral in charge of the spill response was headed back to the Gulf Coast a day after Mississippi's governor said he would press BP and the federal government for more help because oil started washing up on the shoreline of his state.
So far, deadly Tropical Storm Alex that moved into the Gulf on Sunday after dumping rains across Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula was not expected to cross the oil spill area or halt the cleanup and containment efforts.
Tropical systems such as the one that swirling back into the Gulf won't help matters, even though it was forecast to bypass the spill.
After all, this is a region that's no stranger to big stormsBP, the Coast Guard and the state of Lousiana have already been talking about how to coordinate evacuations so workers and equipment involved in the oil spill response don't clog highway escape routes.
