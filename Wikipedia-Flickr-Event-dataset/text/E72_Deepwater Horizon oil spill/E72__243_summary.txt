The agreement does not include the biggest plaintiff in the BP case: the federal government.
The agreement calls for replacing the $20 billion fund created by BP to compensate victims of the spill, and to pay natural resources damages and state and local response costs.
The fund, called the Gulf Coast Claims Facility and run by Kenneth R. Feinberg, a lawyer, would become a new fund administered by the court.
The company announced that payments to people making claims under the Feinberg fund would continue to be paid during the transition.
Along with the settlement for economic damages, BP and the plaintiffsâ€™ committee reached an agreement on medical issues related to the spill, and will provide compensation and medical services for 21 years.
