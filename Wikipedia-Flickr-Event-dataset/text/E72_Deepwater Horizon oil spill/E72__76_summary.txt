The U.S. Coast Guard says new oil spotted 16 miles northeast of the shut-in BP Macondo well is too dispersed to be recovered.
The oil was first spotted by On Wings of Care pilot Bonny Schumaker during a flight over the area on Tuesday.
Schumaker reported a 10 mile by 4 mile string of oily sheen and thicker material to the Coast Guard National Response Center the same day.
Petty Officer Bill Colclough said today that the Coast Guard is investigating the spill.
The samples were determined by Louisiana State University chemists to match the chemical "fingerprint" of oil released from the Macondo well last year.
