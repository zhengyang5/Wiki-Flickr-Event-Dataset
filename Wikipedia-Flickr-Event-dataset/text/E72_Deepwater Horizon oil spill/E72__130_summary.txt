That ended with the BP Oil Spill.
This article, (thanks JD) is about a legal wrangle between BP and the White House over access to White House emails.
The White House overall was remarkably effective in blunting public outrage and blame directed against itself and ensuring through its powerful office that the President in particular was innoculated.
Except for “talking points for the White House” as CNN called the emissions from the JIC after the White House took control.
(Full disclosure, my previous company was engaged by both the US government and BP in the oil spill.)
