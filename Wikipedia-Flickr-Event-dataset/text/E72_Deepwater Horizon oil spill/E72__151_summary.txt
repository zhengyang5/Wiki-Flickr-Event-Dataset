Abstract To assess the potential impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on offshore ecosystems, 11 sites hosting deep-water coral communities were examined 3 to 4 mo after the well was capped.
Healthy deep-water coral communities observed in November 2010 from various sites >20 km from the Macondo well (shown as a star on map).
Although the spatial and temporal proximity of this impact to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill might be coincidental, the normal longevity of deep-water corals and the lack of visual evidence of impact to deep-water corals elsewhere in the GoM suggest that this may not be the case.
The data suggest the Deepwater Horizon oil spill impacted a community of deep-water corals near the Macondo well.
However, life in deep-water coral ecosystems is known to operate at a slow pace.
