The Deepwater Horizon spill has taken an emotional toll on many people, with some describing the damage in the Gulf of Mexico as a "sacred loss" of fragile environments and endangered species.
(Carol Guzy/THE WASHINGTON POST)The oil in a slick detected in the Gulf of Mexico last month matched oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill two years ago, the Coast Guard said Wednesday night, ending one mystery and creating another.
“The exact source of the oil is unclear at this time but could be residual oil associated with the wreckage or debris left on the seabed from the Deepwater Horizon incident,” the Coast Guard said.
The Coast Guard said the size of the sheen has varied with weather conditions.
In a meeting Wednesday, the Coast Guard told the companies to come up with a plan of action for determining the source.
