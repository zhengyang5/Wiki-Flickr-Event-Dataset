The Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010 was the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
At the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill and Ecosystem Science Conference in New Orleans this week, a group of scientists presented data to support their dirty bathtub hypothesis.
As the dirty blizzard drew particles deeper underwater, it may have been strengthened by the dirty bathtub phenomenon.
He believes that the dirty blizzard and dirty bathtub effects may have sent as much as 30 percent of the spilled oil to the bottom of the Gulf.
Bottom-feeders also churn up the sediment and could keep oil flowing on the ocean floor for years.
