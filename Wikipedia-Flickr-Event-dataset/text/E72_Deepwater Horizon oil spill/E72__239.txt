Mississippi AG Sues Kenneth Feinberg

by Associated Press

Mississippi's attorney general is suing the administrator of BP's $20 billion oil spill fund to get access to claims filed by coastal residents.

JACKSON, Mississippi - Jim Hood said Tuesday that he has tried to negotiate with the fund's administrator, Washington lawyer Kenneth Feinberg. He says he's seeking to make the process more transparent so people will know if Feinberg is looking out for the best interests of oil spill victims or BP.



Now Hood filed the lawsuit in Hinds County Chancery Court. Feinberg didn't immediately respond to a message. Hood has previously said he believes Feinberg's operation is intentionally delaying and denying legitimate claims.



Feinberg has been criticized by others about the size and pace of payments and a perceived lack of transparency.
