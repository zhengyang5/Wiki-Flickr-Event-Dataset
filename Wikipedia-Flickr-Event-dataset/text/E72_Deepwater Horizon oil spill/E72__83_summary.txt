More than a month after BP and the Coast Guard finished a subsea operation to inspect the Deepwater Horizon site for oil leaks, no source has been found.
Also, BP and the Coast Guard have not publicly identified a mystery white, milky substance observed seeping from the wreckage.
Recurring oil sheens have been spotted in recent months around the Deepwater Horizon site.
Several missions to inspect the sunken Deepwater Horizon platform, riser pipe, wellhead, relief wells and containment domes found no oil leaks.
The Coast Guard said the main components of the Deepwater Horizon wreckage, including BP's main Macondo well and two relief wells, were found to be secure.
