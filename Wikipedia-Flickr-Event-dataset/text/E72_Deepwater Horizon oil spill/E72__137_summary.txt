A C-130 Hercules from the Air Force Reserve Command deploys dispersant into the Gulf of Mexico May 5, 2010, as part of the Deepwater Horizon/BP oil spill response effort.
Because oil is hydrophobic (doesn't mix with water), it floats to the surface when it spills into the ocean and forms large slicks.
In the case of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, clean-up workers treated the oil with over 1.4 million gallons of various chemical dispersants.
But during the BP oil spill, they were also injected straight into the Macondo wellhead, the source of the leak, in order to reduce the amount of oil that reached the ocean surface.
Just because the oil and dispersants are out of human sight and mind in the deep sea doesn't mean they're gone.
