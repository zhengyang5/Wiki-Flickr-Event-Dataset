WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BP and its partners made a series of cost-cutting decisions that ultimately contributed to the oil spill that ravaged the Gulf of Mexico coast over the summer, the White House oil spill commission said on Wednesday.
Created by President Barack Obama in the midst of the BP spill, the panel is the first government-sanctioned group to wrap up its probe of the causes of the drilling disaster.
Charged with guiding the future of offshore drilling, the commission will release its full review of the spill and its aftermath next week.
BP was also blasted for various decisions made as it attempted temporarily to abandon the Macondo well.
In response to the report, Transocean said the company’s workers were “well trained” and considered among the best in the business.
