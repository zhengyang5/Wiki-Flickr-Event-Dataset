BP has always claimed that it shared all information with the public and with the federal government about the extent of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and the rate of flow of the leaking oil.
Former BP engineer Kurt Mix is being charged by federal prosecutors with obstructing the law.
BP always claimed that they didnâ€™t learn of the spills full extent until after April, when in fact they knew almost immediately.
BP executives told the coast guard that their best estimates held the leak at 1,000 barrels a day.
If BP is indeed found guilty of deceiving the federal prosecutors, then they could find themselves with a much heftier fine than before.
