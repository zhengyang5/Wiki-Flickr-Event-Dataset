In all instances, prokaryote abundance increased in response to additions of oil, dispersant or dispersed oil, suggesting that all three treatments provide increased organic carbon that can be utilized by the prokaryote community.
In August, one of the Teflon bags in the Dispersed Oil treatment developed a leak, resulting in mixing with the surrounding water.
The probe was cleaned following exposure to oil and dispersed oil according to the protocols from YSI.
In a study looking at the interaction between dispersed oil at low temperatures (∼−1.6°C), high settling of oil and poor dispersion was observed [26].
