by Tom WraggI was part of a group of students who disrupted the talk Tony Hayward gave at Birmingham this week.
It was not Tony Hayward who died when the rig exploded or his communities that were destroyed by pollution.
Since leaving BP Tony Hayward has been appointed as the senior independent director of Glencore, one of the world’s biggest mining companies.
A Swiss NGO has said that even compared to the bad bunch that is mining companies “Glencore is still in the dark ages”.
People have raised the criticism that we, through this action, have violated Tony Hayward’s right to free speech.
