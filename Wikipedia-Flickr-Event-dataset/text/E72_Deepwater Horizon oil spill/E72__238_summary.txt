Gulf oil spill report, released Wednesday, said in the days leading up to the disaster, BP made a series of decisions that complicated cementing operations, added risk, and may have contributed to the ultimate failure of the cement job.
The report said BP, and in some cases its contractors, violated seven federal regulations at the time of the incident.
Hafle — a key decision maker on the doomed rig — refused to testify before the federal panel in August 2010, citing his constitutional right against self-incrimination.
The oil spill off Louisiana spewed more than 200 million gallons of crude from an undersea well owned by BP.
Markey has sponsored a bill to implement many of the changes suggested by the president's independent spill panel.
