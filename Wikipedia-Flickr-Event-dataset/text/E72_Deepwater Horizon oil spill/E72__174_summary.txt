Many of the chemicals present in BP oil and dispersants are known to cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, kidney damage, altered renal function, and irritation of the digestive tract.
Many of the chemicals are mutagenic, terratogenic, and carcinogenic.
Pathways of exposure to the chemicals are inhalation, ingestion, skin, and eye contact.
Al Jazeera has talked with dozens of sick people across the Gulf Coast who attribute their illnesses to chemicals from BP's oil disaster.
We are going to have thousands of people who are extremely sick, and if they aren't treated, a large number of them are going to die."
