Newswise — The dispersant used to remediate the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is more toxic to cold-water corals than the spilled oil, according to a study conducted at Temple University.
They found that the dispersant is toxic to the corals at lower concentrations than the oil.
The researchers’ findings, “Response of deep-water corals to oil and chemical dispersant exposure,” were published online in the journal Deep-Sea Research II.
Normally applied to the water’s surface, the spill marked the first time that dispersants were applied at depth during an oil spill.
“It doesn’t take as much dispersant to kill a coral as it does oil,” Cordes said, adding that the oil in combination with the dispersant increases the toxicity of the oil.
