The dissolution of the slick should reduce the risk of oil killing more animals or hitting shorelines.
The effect on sea life of the large amounts of oil that dissolved below the surface is still a mystery.
Scientists said the rapid dissipation of the surface oil was probably due to a combination of factors.
The response itself has become the principal livelihood for thousands of fishermen and other workers whose lives were upended by the oil spill.
Those fishermen are unconvinced that the gradual disappearance of oil on the surface means they will be able to return to work soon.
