LESTER HOLT, anchor: Just hours before President Obama 's prime-time speech about the oil disaster this evening, there was a big setback in efforts to capture that oil.
A new government estimate puts the flow rate between 1 1/2 million to over 2 1/2 million gallons of oil a day.
What we know for sure is that miles of gulf coastline, from Louisiana to Florida , have now been impacted by the oil.
That started a fire on the same ship that's siphoning and collecting oil from BP 's broken pipe.
I mean, BP 's credibility is shot with these local town folk, with us.
