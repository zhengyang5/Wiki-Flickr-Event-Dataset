Samples of oil taken from a sheen above the site of the sunken Deepwater Horizon oil rig and BP's Macondo 252 well matches oil released from the well during the 2010 spill, the U.S. Coast Guard announced late Wednesday.
The Coast Guard has informed BP and Transocean, owner of the sunken Deepwater Horizon oil rig, that they may be held financially liable for the new oil.
The release said the Coast Guard has sent a Notice of Federal Interest to BP and Transocean.
"The sheen is not feasible to recover and does not pose a risk to the shoreline," the Coast Guard news release said.
