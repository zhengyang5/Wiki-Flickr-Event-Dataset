The Back to Work Coalition is a working group established by Department of Natural Resources Secretary Scott A. Angelle under the direction of Governor Bobby Jindal.
In November, Governor Jindal appointed Secretary Angelle the state's liaison for federal oil and gas permitting issues.
The Back to Work Coalition is comprised of interested stakeholders from oil and gas trade associations and industry stakeholders.
"The Back to Work Coalition is an innovative partnership that is absolutely necessary for making headway in the federal permitting process," said Jim Noe, Back to Work Coalition member and Senior Vice President and General Counsel for Hercules Offshore.
The Back to Work Coalition also recognized Governor Jindal for his dedication and leadership to finding solutions to the offshore issues that affect the livelihood of many Louisianians.
