Before I make a statement on the economy, I just want to offer an update on the ongoing federal response to the worsening oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
And we're going to continue to update the American people on the situation in the Gulf going forward.
Today, we learned that in the first quarter of this year, our economy grew at a rate of 3.2 percent.
Theyâ€™re still trying to recover from a shockwave of lost homes, lost businesses, and more than eight million lost jobs.
