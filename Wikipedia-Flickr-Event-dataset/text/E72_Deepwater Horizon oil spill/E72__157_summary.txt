They found problems like drastically low weight, low blood sugar and, in some cases, cancer of the liver and lungs.
Lori Schwacke, the lead scientist for the health assessment, said the findings were preliminary and could not be conclusively linked to the oil spill at this point.
Strandings of dolphins began rising in states along the Gulf of Mexico in February 2010, or about two months before the oil spill.
He said the results could provide “possible clues” to the effects of the oil spill on other dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico.
“However, it is too soon to tell how the Barataria Bay findings apply,” he said.
