A pair of deepwater relief wells still represent the best chance of stopping the leaking oil well in the Gulf of MexicoThe relief wells are essentially copies of the well that caught fire and killed 11 men on April 20, starting the Gulf oil disaster.
While containment chambers and "top kill" and "junk kill" attempts at the well's failed blowout preventer have made headlines, the relief wells have quietly continued.
The oil industry has relied upon relief wells since the 1920s to stop well blowouts.
Relief wells were part of BP's response plan filed last year with the federal government:â€¢ Relief well 1, started May 2, has drilled to a depth of 13,978 feet.
Similar relief wells stopped Mexico's 1979-80 Ixtoc oil spill, the largest accidental leak in history, which ran for 290 days.
