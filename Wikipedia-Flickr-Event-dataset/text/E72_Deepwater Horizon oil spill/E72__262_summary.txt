Two years after oil from a BP well began gushing into the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed criminal charges alleging that a former BP employee destroyed critical evidence in the early days of the unfolding disaster.
Mix was specifically instructed by attorneys contracted by BP to retain his records before he deleted them, the affidavit states.
Analysts have long expected criminal charges against BP or its employees.
Mix could not be reached for comment, and we were unable to leave him a message because his voicemail was full.
At the time, BP said publicly that the measure had a 70 percent chance of success.
