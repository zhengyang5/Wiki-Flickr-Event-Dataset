In its final report on the causes of the largest offshore oil spill in US history, the commission said BP and its collaborators on the doomed Macondo well had lacked a system to ensure their actions were safe.
Created by President Barack Obama in the midst of the BP spill, the panel is the first government-sanctioned group to wrap up its probe of the causes of the drilling disaster.
Eventually, the panel made the document public and the final report included a similar chart.
The commission also concluded the Gulf spill was not an isolated incident caused by "rogue industry or government officials".
Transocean and BP were chided for lacking an internal procedure for interpreting negative pressure tests, which workers on the Deepwater Horizon rig misread.
