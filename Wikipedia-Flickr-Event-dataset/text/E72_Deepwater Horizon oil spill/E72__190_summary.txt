London-based BP PLC, the largest oil and gas producer in the Gulf, released its latest tally of response costs Monday.
The figure does not include a $20 billion fund for Gulf damages BP created last month.
As BP continued drilling relief wells that are the best hope for plugging the blown-out well, a giant new oil skimming vessel was tested in the Gulf.
The current spate of bad weather is likely to last well into next week, according to the National Weather Service.
BP officials have said theyâ€™re running slightly ahead of schedule on the drilling, but expect weather or other delays.
