Editor's note: Frances Beinecke is one of seven commissioners serving on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.
Now it's our job, as members of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Disaster and Offshore Drilling, to make sure we learn the lessons that have come at such a high cost.
As long as we rely on offshore oil and gas production, though, we must do everything we possibly can to minimize the risk to workers, habitat and wildlife.
We must strike the right balance between energy production and the need to protect our workers, our oceans and all they support.
The Congress has a responsibility to pass legislation to strengthen the safeguards we need to protect our workers, oceans and coastal communities.
