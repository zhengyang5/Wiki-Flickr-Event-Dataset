REUTERS/Lee Celano(Reuters) - One of BP's attempts to curb payouts for what it says are "fictitious" and "absurd" claims related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill has failed after a legal appeal was rejected by a U.S. court.
The ruling is a blow to the company's attempt to curb payouts to what it says are undeserving claimants.
The blast ruptured a BP well killing 11 people and triggering the largest-ever U.S. offshore oil spill.
It has filed numerous lawsuits to curb payouts related to the spill after taking provisions for $42.4 billion to cover the clean-up, compensation and fines.
