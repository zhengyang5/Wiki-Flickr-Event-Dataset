Around 4.9m barrels leaked from the time the well ruptured a mile below sea level on April 20 following an explosion that killed 11 workers and its capping on July 15, with only some 800,000 barrels captured during containment operations, according to new US government estimates.

As BP moved to shut down the Macondo well once and for all, scientist said it gushed at the rate of 62,000 barrels of oil per day initially - more than 12 times faster than BP had admitted shortly after the blowout.

The new numbers could play a crucial role in determining how much BP is fined under the Clean Water Act, which allows the US government to seek civil penalties for illegal oil discharges.

Fines under the law range from $1,100 a barrel spilled to as high as $4,300 per barrel spilled, if negligence is proven. This mean BP could theoretically face fines of up to $17.6bn for the 4.1 million barrels that poured into the sea.

Plans to shut the the runaway well on Tuesday have been delayed by a small hydraulic leak in the capping stack.

When the "static kill" procedure starts, oil will first be piped into the well to test whether it is capable of absorbing the mud and cement that should push oil back into the reservoir 13,000 feet below the sea bed.

Then heavy mud and cement will be pumped at the rate of a barrel a minute into the top of the well in the hope of producing a permanent cap for the first time since a temporary seal was made 19 days ago.

The "static kill" is a prelude to a "bottom kill".

BP will carry out extensive tests on the seabed seal before moving to the "bottom kill" â€“ pumping cement through relief wells that intersect the damaged well to finally block it.
