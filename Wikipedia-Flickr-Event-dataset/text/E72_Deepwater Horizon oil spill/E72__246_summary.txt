BP estimated that it would have to pay about $7.8 billion in the Deepwater Horizon disaster settlement.
A group representing the plaintiffs in the case said the settlement "will fully compensate hundreds of thousands of victims of the tragedy."
"The settlement is to be fully funded by BP, with no cap on the amount BP will pay," the group added.
Among the thousands of plaintiffs are fishermen, hotel owners and other Gulf Coast residents.
The three-month-long spill, the largest oil spill in U.S. history, was triggered after an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010.
