There's something missing in the Coast Guard's latest PR photos of oil spill cleanup workers: protective gear.
The photos, first noted by a Facebook group that advocates health protections for cleanup workers, were taken by a Coast Guard petty officer and posted to the agency's Visual Information Gallery.
A caption describes the workers as "contractors working to clean the beaches in Galveston."
"There's a tension between the two things, and you have to deal with both," Hearl said.
We contacted the Coast Guard this morning to ask about the photos and find out which contractor was in charge of the site, but haven't yet gotten a response.
