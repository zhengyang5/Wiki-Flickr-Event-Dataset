Remember the mighty oil-eating microbes, aka marine bacteria, that commentators from the White House on down hailed as a major natural weapon in combating the Gulf oil disaster?
Gram-positive bacteria have a single-membrane cell wall, while Gram-negative bacteria have a double-membrane cell wall.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria are "Gram-positive," while the oil-eating bacteria are Gram-negative.
A component of the double-membrane cell-wall structure of Gram-negative bacteria can irritate human skin, causing inflammation and activating the immune system.
In other words, oil-eating bacteria, just because they are Gram-negative, can cause skin rashes.
