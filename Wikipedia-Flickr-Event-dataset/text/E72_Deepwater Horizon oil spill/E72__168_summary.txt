A dramatic increase in dolphin deaths in the Gulf of Mexico is directly linked to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, scientists concluded in a report published Wednesday.
In contrast, only 7 percent of stranded dolphins found outside of the Deepwater Horizon spill zone have had similar adrenal gland damage.
BP responded to the report by questioning the link between dolphin deaths and the oil spill.
Even though the UME may have overlapped in some areas with the oil spill, correlation is not evidence of causation," Morell added.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated BP owned the Deepwater Horizon.
