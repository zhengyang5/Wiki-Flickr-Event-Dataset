Elmer’s Island Wildlife Refuge, even after all the warnings, looks worse than I imagined.
The next day, cops drive up and down Grand Isle beach explicitly telling tourists it is still open, just stay out of the water.
She tells me BP’s in charge because “it’s BP’s oil.”“But it’s not BP’s land.”“But BP’s liable if anything happens.”“So you’re saying it’s a safety precaution.”“Yeah!
When everyone saw the oil coming in as clear as day several days before that, BP insisted it was red tide—algae.
When I joke with one worker that he should pocket the solid gobs of oil he’s digging up to show me how far beneath the sand they go, he stops dead and asks me if BP’s still trying to use the oil they all collect.
