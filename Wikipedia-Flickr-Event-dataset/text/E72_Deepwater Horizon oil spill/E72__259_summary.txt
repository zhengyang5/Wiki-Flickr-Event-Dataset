Barbier wrote in his decision today in New Orleans federal court that BP was “reckless,” while Transocean and Halliburton were negligent.
A former maritime lawyer who began his career representing sailors in personal-injury cases, the judge has been overseeing BP spill litigation since August 2010.
BP denied it was grossly negligent while accepting blame for errors that caused the spill.
BP Exploration & Production Inc. and BP American Production Co. are direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of BP Plc, Barbier wrote in his ruling.
The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).
