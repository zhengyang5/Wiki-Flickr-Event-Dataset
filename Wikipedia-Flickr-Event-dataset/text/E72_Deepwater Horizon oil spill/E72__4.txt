Daily World JACKSON, Miss.  They sometimes seem to be forgotten victims as the nation focuses on efforts to stop the massive oil spill fouling the Gulf of Mexico But the 11 men who died in the rig explosion off the Louisiana coast were remembered Tuesday in a somber memorial service here, where hundreds of family and friends gathered. The memorial at the Jackson Convention Complex, held more than a month after the April 20 disaster, was organized by Transocean, a Swiss company that owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Nine of the men killed worked for Transocean. President Obama, meantime, prepared to head to the Gulf on Friday to review efforts to halt the flow. At the well site 40 miles off shore, energy giant BP, owner of the well, was preparing another attempt Wednesday to choke off the gusher 5,000 feet underwater by shoving mud and cement into the hole. The tactic, called a "top kill," has never been tried at that depth.

"We want what everybody wants — to stop the flow at the source as quickly as possible," BP spokesman John Curry said. Also Tuesday, House investigators released a memo questioning whether "proper procedures were followed." Unusual pressure readings in the hours before the blowout indicated there was "a very large abnormality" in the well, said a memo released by the House Energy Committee. That suggested that a cement plug, which was supposed to seal off the shaft, had not done so, the memo said. However, the information was ignored and the drilling crew began removing the drilling mud that was holding back the high-pressure oil and gas. A BP investigator told Congress that the decision was a "fundamental mistake," according to the memo. 'Community of loss' At the memorial service, country band Diamond Rio and New Orleans group Joyful Gospel Choir performed. The service also featured messages from Max Lucado, a Christian author. Country music star Trace Adkins, who worked six years on an offshore rig in the Gulf before his music career, sent his condolences in a videotaped tribute. His song, Missing You, about working offshore, was played with images of the workers. "It was hard work and it was dangerous work, but nobody, especially today, expects it to end like this," he said.

At times choking back tears, Newman talked about each of the nine Transocean employees who died. "They were hardworking men who loved their country and their god," he said. Chris Rivers, CEO of M-I SWACO, a drilling company that employed the two other men killed, said, "These men are heroes, all 11 of them." Transocean guarded access to the families, some of whom have filed suit against the company. Earlier this month, Transocean filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Houston to limit its legal liability to $27 million, the value of the sunken rig. Eleven bronze hard hats ringed the podium and were presented to family members, who came from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Sheryl Revette, widow of Dewey Revette of State Line, Miss., said Transocean had been in touch with her. She said they have not discussed a financial settlement but expects to after the memorial. Dewey Revette, 48, was a driller on the rig with 29 years experience. He was the father of two daughters, 18 and 23. For all the risks of offshore oil work, Sheryl Revette said they felt it was safer than many alternatives and it afforded him long stretches of time off at home. "There's always danger," she said. "You just have to make sure you live each day. None of us are promised tomorrow." With the nation focused on efforts to stop the oil flowing into the Gulf, Revette said families of the victims have talked to one another and had support of friends and family. She added that she is "proud of what he (Dewey) stood for and how Transocean is dealing with it." Most of the attendees declined to speak to the news media, but the few who did spoke warmly of the service. "It shows on a national level that he is remembered," said David Bryan, uncle of Aaron Dale Burkeen, of Philadelphia, Miss. "It shows my sister and Dale's wife are not alone." No remains Each of the victims was remembered earlier at individual private funerals. With no remains recovered, friends and family of Keith Blair Manuel, 56, interred a memory box of some of his favorite items, the Daily World of Opelousas, La., reported. A ceremony was held this month at St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Eunice, La., where he grew up. Manuel was to be married in July. Mark Derouen, who was to serve as best man, told the Daily World that Manuel had just arrived on the rig for a two-week tour when the explosion happened. "He was working at the biggest deepwater rig on earth. He was at the top of his profession," Derouen said.
