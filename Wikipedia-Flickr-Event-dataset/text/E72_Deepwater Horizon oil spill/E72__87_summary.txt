The creation of the Florida Keys Environmental Coalition was the main act of direct action.
The Florida Keys especially were at risk for environmental degradation.
Dan Robey, a Florida Keys native set up the website KeysSpill.com in May.
The Florida Keys Environmental Coalition (FKEC) formed in order to reclaim some control of planning for a response to the spill.
He and other activists went to the meeting to complain about the lack of preparation efforts by BP in case the oil came to the Florida Keys.
