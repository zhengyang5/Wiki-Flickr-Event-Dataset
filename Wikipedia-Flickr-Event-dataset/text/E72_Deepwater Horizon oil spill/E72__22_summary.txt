The US Coast Guard office in Louisiana has confirmed that Transocean's semisubmersible, Deepwater Horizon, has sunk in approximately 5,000 feet of water off the coast of Louisiana at approximately 10:30 a.m, (CST) this morning.
BP says five deepwater open ocean recovery vessels are currently on location with more on the way and skimming operations have begun.
The barge storage capacity in the area is just over 120,0000 bbls/day with more storage capacity also on the way.
The Deepwater Horizon was built in Ulsan, South Korea by Hyundai Heavy Industries at a cost of approximately $365 million and entered service in 2001.
