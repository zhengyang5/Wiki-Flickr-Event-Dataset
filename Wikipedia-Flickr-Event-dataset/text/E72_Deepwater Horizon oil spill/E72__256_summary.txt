BP lawyer Mike Brock said the blame was shared by all three companies.
Most observers expect the case to be settled before the trial results in a verdict.
The trial's first phase focuses on how much each company is to blame and the degree of negligence.
"We will ask the court at the end of this trial to rule that all three - BP, Transocean, and Halliburton - are liable for punitive damages to the state of Alabama," Strange said.
The second phase of the trial, expected to start in September, will focus on the flow rate of the oil that spewed from the well.
