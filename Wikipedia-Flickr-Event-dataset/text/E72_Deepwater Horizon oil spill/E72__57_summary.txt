PressureUS officials had feared that if the pressure caused by shutting off the flow of oil increases too quickly, it could send oil shooting up from a new leak on the sea floor.
If they progress as hoped, BP said no oil would flow from the well for the first time since a rig being drilled for BP by Transocean Ltd sank days after an April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers.
However, BP warned the outcome was uncertain since the system has never been tested at such depths.
If the cap is not sealed, BP intends to contain the whole of the oil flow by mid-July by siphoning it off through pipes to ships at the surface.
The only proven way to permanently kill the leak lies in the drilling of relief wells to intercept the ruptured one.
