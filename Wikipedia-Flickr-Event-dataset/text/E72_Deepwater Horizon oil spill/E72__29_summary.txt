The first of 98 rescued workers from the oil rig explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig arrived at a Kenner hotel Thursday shortly after 4:30 a.m., after a 100-plus mile boat journey from the burning rig to Port Fourchon Wednesday evening.
Private security guards with Blackhawk Protection blocked media access to the hotel early Thursday, and would not let reporters or photographers near the area where rig workers were getting off vans.
Within a half-hour of their arrival in Kenner, many workers and their families were already heading home.
Two Coast Guard cutters continued the search overnight.
Overall, the Coast Guard has surveyed 1,940 square miles in a series of 17 separate air and sea search missions since the Tuesday explosion.
