Most of the tens of thousands of white pelicans that nest on the lake islands winter in the Gulf of Mexico, so scientists are investigating the spill’s effect on these migratory birds.
In the first batch, petroleum compounds were detected in 90 percent of the eggs, and Corexit was present in almost 80 percent.
As Gunderson explains, scientists are primarily worried about polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have been shown to cause developmental abnormalities in birds.
Researchers are a long way from understanding the potential effect of the oil spill pollutants as they have received only the first preliminary results of lab tests.
