BP and Coast Guard officials contend the cleanup is winding down.
And we have BP and the Coast Guard trying to pull up stakes and get out of here, and that's frustrating."
Graves complained that the Coast Guard and BP are now dropping areas from the spill-response program over the state's objections.
"The Coast Guard is not abiding by the agreements they signed with us, and the Coast Guard can't absolve or relieve BP of their statutory obligation to clean up the oil," he said.
Since the beginning of the spill, the team has identified 723 miles of Louisiana coast with oil, including the Interior properties.
