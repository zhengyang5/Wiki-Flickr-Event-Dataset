Allen said a pressure test to ensure the cement plug would hold was completed at 5:54 a.m. CDT.
The relief well intersected the blown-out well Thursday, and crews started pumping in the cement on Friday.
The April 20 blast killed 11 workers, and 206 million gallons of oil spewed.
The disaster also has taken a toll on the once mighty oil giant BP PLC.
BP took some of the blame for the Gulf oil disaster in an internal report issued earlier this month, acknowledging among other things that its workers misinterpreted a key pressure test of the well.
