GULFPORT -- Baby dolphins, some barely three feet in length, are washing up along the Mississippi and Alabama shorelines at about 10 times the normal number for the first two months of the year, researchers are finding.
The institute has collected 13 infant dolphins in the last two weeks and three more on Monday along the Gulfport and Horn Island beaches.
Bill Walker, head of the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources said his teams will work with the institute to collect the bodies of infant dolphins on Horn Island.
Ive watched it.She goes into a frenzy trying to get the baby to respond and then stays with her dead infant, sometimes for hours before she lets it go.
Thats why some of the dead dolphin infants identified in the last two weeks have trauma to their bodies, he said.
