A Washington-based advocate of foreign investment today warned of the potential damage to the reputation of British companies in the United States in the wake of the rhetoric surrounding the BP oil-spill disaster.
"Some politicians are taking this tragedy and taking an opportunity to grandstand on patriotism â€“ that is happening, without question.
When people are using the old name [for BP], British Petroleum, it is an attempt to promote patriotism and a pro-American view.
Figures supplied by the OFII show that close to 1 million people are employed by the US subsidiaries of British companies, making them the largest overseas employer by nationality.
The organisation said that foreign direct investment in the US fell by around 50% last year.
