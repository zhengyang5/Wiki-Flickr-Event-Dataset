Female rotifer, Brachionus manjavacas, with eggs: R. Rico-Martinez et al.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.09.024A new study finds that adding Corexit 9500A to Macondo oil—as BP did in the course of trying to disperse its 2010 oilspill disaster—made the mixture 52 times more toxic than oil alone.
The results are from toxicology tests in the lab and appear in the scientific journal Environmental Pollution.
Using oil from the Deepwater Horizon blowout and Corexit the researchers tested the toxicity of oil, dispersant, and a mixture of oil and dispersant on five strains of rotifers—the lab rats of marine toxicology testing.
I wrote here about how BP’s oilspill has hammered Gulf fish.
