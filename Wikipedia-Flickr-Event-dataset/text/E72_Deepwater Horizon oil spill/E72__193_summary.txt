BP gas station owners across the country are divided over whether the oil giant stained by its handling of the Gulf spill should rebrand U.S. outlets as Amoco or another name as part of efforts to repair the company's badly damaged reputation.
But some station owners worry that a name change is risky given all the marketing dollars already spent building up the BP brand.
Kleine noted that many distributors would still like BP to try to rebuild its existing brand, and two BP officials said in e-mails that the company is not considering rebranding U.S. gas stations.
Bob Juckniess, who owns 10 BP-branded stations in the Chicago area, wants the company to consider rebranding them as Amoco stations.
"The BP brand is very tarnished right now, not just the brand but the reputation as a company is tarnished," Juckniess said.
