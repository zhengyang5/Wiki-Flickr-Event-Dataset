(AP) â€” BP PLC says a mile-long tube is drawing most of the oil away from a well that has spewed millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico.
Mr. Proelger said it was sucking most of the oil from the leak.
Meanwhile, scientists have found huge plumes of oil lurking under the surface of the water in the Gulf of Mexico.
At least 210,000 gallons of oil a day has gushed into the Gulf since an oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later.
Meanwhile, BP began spraying undersea dispersants at that leak site and said the chemicals appear to have reduced the amount of surface oil.
