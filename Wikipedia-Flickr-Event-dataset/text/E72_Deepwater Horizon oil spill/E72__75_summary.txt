"We are currently on the scene with a vessel and have no reports of a visible sheen at the site," said BP's Thomas.
"A second science vessel on site throughout the day also did not see a sheen on the water.
The report came after similar reports of oil sheen near the BP site by Bonny Schumaker, who operates "On Wings of Care," which has provided overflights of the Gulf for environmental groups during the past year.
Despite that finding, Chief Petty Officer John Edwards said the Coast Guard had no further plans to investigate at the site.
Once the Coast Guard goes out to investigate, the sheen has dissipated or is no longer in the same location."
