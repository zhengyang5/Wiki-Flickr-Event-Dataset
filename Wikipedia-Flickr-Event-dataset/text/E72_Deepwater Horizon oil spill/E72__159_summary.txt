Bottlenose dolphins with deformities including missing teeth and lung disease have been found in the Gulf of Mexico a year after the BP oil spill, according to US researchers.
During the study, researchers briefly captured dolphins off the coast of central Louisiana in 2011 to check their health.
The health of the animals was compared with 27 bottlenose dolphins from the Sarasota Bay, Florida, which was unaffected by the oil spill.
We just haven't seen animals that were in such bad shape as what we saw in Barataria Bay,‚Äù she added.
Three of the Barataria Bay dolphins had also lost nearly all their teeth, and three others had just half of their normal number of teeth left.
