Lawyers representing businesses and others that suffered from the spill had long accused the company of conducting undocumented cement tests and hiding the results.
BP had accused Halliburton of destroying evidence of its cement testing.
Legal scholars said the guilty plea would probably work against Halliburton in the civil trial in New Orleans to determine the share of damages owed to the Gulf states and businesses affected by the spill.
Last November, BP agreed to pay $4.5 billion in penalties and pleaded guilty to 14 criminal charges related to the explosion.
“It’s another bad day for Halliburton and a very good day for BP,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer.
