Surge from Tropical Storm Lee uncovered numerous tar mats, dozens of tar balls and abandoned strings of oil snare pom-poms along a stretch of Fourchon Beach owned by the Wisner Donation Trust, according to the property's manager.
"In some locations, the mats fell apart and tar balls blew up the beach and into the back marsh," Norman said.
"If anyone has concerns regarding oil or tar balls on the beaches they should call the Response Center at 800.424.8802," he said in an e-mail.
BP contractors were scooping tar balls off Alabama Gulf Coast beaches on Wednesday after similar reports.
Norman said the uncovering of the new tar mats and tar balls should come as no surprise.
