This morning, I surveyed just one small portion of the damage caused by what is now the largest oil spill in American history.
This afternoon, our team from Washington met with Attorneys General and U.S.
But as we have said all along, we must also ensure that anyone found responsible for this spill is held accountable.
Oil that we know has already affected plant and animal life along the coast, and has impacted the lives and livelihoods of all too many in this region.
They have been working diligently ever since to gather facts and coordinate the governmentâ€™s legal response.
