Tuna study reveals how pollution causes heart problemsA small dead fish floats on oil off the coast of Louisiana after the Deepwater Horizon spill.
12THE reason people have more heart attacks when air pollution levels rise may have been revealed by a study on the effect of the BP oil spill on tuna.
Heart problems in humans and fish have long been linked to air pollution and oil spills respectively.
They collected oil samples and young fish from the site and studied the effect of both fresh and 'weathered' oil on the fish heart muscles.
It's not yet clear when the Gulf fisheries will stop feeling the effects of the oil spill, Scholz said.
