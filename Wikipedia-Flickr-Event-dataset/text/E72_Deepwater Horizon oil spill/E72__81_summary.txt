BP announced Thursday that it has sealed a 40-foot-tall, 86-ton steel containment dome that has been leaking oil below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, causing repeated sheens near the site of the disasterous BP oil spill in 2010.
However, Coast Guard Capt.
Duke Walker, the federal on-scene coordinator for the Deepwater Horizon spill, did not announce publicly that he had approved BP's capping plan until the containment dome was sealed.
The ROVs also inserted plugs into four small connection ports on the top and side of the containment dome.
The Coast Guard also released a copy of the two-page letter containing the joint BP-Transocean plan for identifying the source of the sheen.
