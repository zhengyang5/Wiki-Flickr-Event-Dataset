On October 21, 2009, the Transocean Marianas semisub arrived on location to spud an exploration well on the Macondo prospect. Several days later drilling commenced but was halted on Nov. 28, 2009, when the semisub underwent repairs for damage caused by Hurricane Ida. BP leased another rig, the Deepwater Horizon semisub to complete drilling operations on the well. The Deepwater Horizon semisub commenced operations in February 2010 and then terminated drilling at a depth of just over 18,000 feet (5,486 meters).



On Tuesday, April 20, an explosion occurred on the drilling rig. After the initial blowout occurred, the leaking wellhead continued to feed the fire onboard the semisub until the rig ultimately collapsed.



Subsequently, it was estimated the well started leaking roughly 5,000 barrels a day.



In an effort to shut off the oil leak, BP drilled a relief well using Transocean's GSF Development Driller III semisub. The operator also drilled a second relief well using Transocean's Development Driller II semisub. Both relief wells permanently secured the Macondo exploration well.



The Macondo well was capped on July 15, 2010 and permanently killed by sealing the well and annulus with cement on Sept. 19, 2010. The well was later plugged and abandoned.





BP, Coast Guard Find No Sheen near Macondo Type: Status Update Aug. 2011 - BP has confirmed through a visual wellhead assessment that the Macondo well is not releasing oil. Additionally, the company concluded a visual inspection of the Macondo relief well confirming the same result. The investigation was prompted due to press reports stating that sheens of oil observed in the vicinity were from the Macondo well. Multiple surveys conducted of the area has found no evidence of oil sheens in the Macondo vicinity, reiterated the company. The Macondo field is located on Mississippi Canyon Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of 4,993 feet (1,522 meters). BP Declares Macondo Well Dead Type: Status Update Sep. 2010 - BP has confirmed that well kill operations on the Macondo well are completed, with both the casing and annulus of the well sealed by cement. The relief well, drilled by the DDIII, intercepted the annulus of the MC252 well on Sept. 15, followed by pumping of the cement into the annulus on Sept. 17. BP, the federal government scientific team and the National Incident Commander have all concluded that these operations have sealed the annulus of the MC252 well. The operator will now proceed with abandonment operations on the well. BP Re-Starts Relief Well Drilling Operations on Macondo Type: Status Update Sep. 2010 - BP announced it has re-commenced relief well drilling operations on the Macondo well from the Development Driller III, following the installation of a mechanical lock down sleeve that secures the MC252 well's casing hangar. The DD3 is drilling towards Macondo's well intercept point, about 50 feet (15 meters) below. Relief well operations consist of drilling and ranging runs that will guide the rig's drill bit to intercept the well's annulus. Once intercepted, heavy drilling mud and cement will be pumped into the annular space to complete the isolation of the well. The Macondo field is located on Mississippi Canyon Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of 4,993 feet (1,522 meters). BP Continues Ops to Replace Deepwater Horizon's BOP Type: Status Update Sep. 2010 - Following the completion of cementing operations on the MC252 well on August 5, pressure testing has indicated there is an effective cement plug in the casing, reported BP. Operations are now underway to replace the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig's failed blow-out preventer with the DDII drilling rig's BOP, in order to resume drilling of the relief well. The capping stack on top of the DWH BOP was removed by the Discoverer Enterprise drillship on September 2. Once the capping stack is removed, the support vessel will connect a riser to the DWH BOP to remove the BOP from the well. The DDII rig will then move its BOP into place. The DDIII drilling rig is on standby to resume drilling the relief well, which is at a measured depth of 17,909 feet (5,459 meters), and is progressing to intersect with the MC252 well. It is expected the relief well will intercept the MC252 well annulus by mid-September. The Macondo field is located on Mississippi Canyon Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of 4,993 feet (1,522 meters). BP Begins Flushing MC252 Subsea Equipment Type: Status Update Aug. 2010 - BP received approval to flush drilling mud and hydrocarbons from the MC252 well sealing cap, and the original Deepwater Horizon Lower Marine Riser Package and Blow Out Preventer. Once the task is completed, BP will conduct an ambient pressure test to ensure the well is secure.

BP Starts Cementing Process at Macondo Well Type: Status Update Aug. 2010 - BP has commenced cementing operations at the MC252 well, as part of the static kill procedure. This process will complement the ongoing relief well operation, announced the operator. The Macondo prospect is located on Mississippi Canyon Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of 4,993 feet (1,522 meters). BP serves as the operator, holding a 65% interest in the prospect; Anadarko holds 25%; and MOEX 2007 holds the remaining 10%. Macondo Well Reaches Static Condition Type: Status Update Aug. 2010 - The MC252 well has seemingly reached a static condition, announced BP, and will be closely monitored to ensure it remains that way. Dependent upon results, additional pumping of mud may or may not be required. BP and the National Incident Commander and other government officials will determine the next course of action -- assessing whether to inject cement into the well. A relief well still remains the final course of action to kill and permanently cement the well, which is still being drilled. Mid-August is the estimated date of when the first relief well will intercept the Macondo well annulus, and kill and cement operations will commence, according to BP.

BP serves as the operator, holding a 65% interest in the prospect; Anadarko holds 25%; and MOEX 2007 holds the remaining 10%. BP Spuds Relief Well on Macondo Site Type: Drilling Operations May. 2010 - BP began drilling a relief well to intercept and isolate the oil from the Macondo site. The drillship, GSF Development Driller II, is drilling this relief well. BP plans for the new well to intercept the existing, leaking well at a depth of roughly 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) below the seabed and permanently seal it. The new drill site is located about 1.5 miles (2 kilometers) from the leaking well on Mississippi Canyon Block 252, and drilling should take about three months. BP Implementing Low-Tech Strategy at Macondo Well Type: Status Update May. 2010 - A 125-ton system structure, designed to contain hydrocarbons from the leaking wellhead on the Macondo field, is on location and will be placed on top of the source and act as a funnel for the seeping crude oil. The leak is located at the end of the riser, roughly 600 feet (183 meters) from the wellhead. Equipment at the top of the containment chamber is connected to a 5,000-foot (1,524-meter), 6 5/8-inch drill pipe riser that will direct the hydrocarbons to the Deepwater Enterprise surface ship where recovered hydrocarbons will be processed. Oil will be shipped to a designated oil terminal onshore. The Discoverer Enterprise drillship can process 15,000 barrels of oil per day and store 139,000 barrels. A support barge capable of storing 137,000 barrels of oil will also be deployed. BP to Drill a Relief Well at Macondo Site Type: Status Update Apr. 2010 - In an effort to shut off an oil leak at the Macondo well site, BP will drill a relief well using Transocean's GSF Development Driller III semisub, and will also drill a second relief well using Transocean's Development Driller II. Both relief wells will permanently secure the Macondo exploration well. BP is also using other options to halt the oil leak, including the use of ROVs to activate the blowout preventer and the construction of a canopy over the pipeline connected to the well to gather the 5,000 bbls/day of oil that is leaking. BP to Temporarily Abandon Well on Macondo Prospect Type: Status Update Apr. 2010 - Transocean's Deepwater Horizon semisub, which caught fire on April 20, was on contract for BP drilling the Macondo prospect on Mississippi Canyon Block 252 in 4,993 feet (1,522 meters) of water. According to Dow Jones, the well had reached a depth of at least 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) and was cased and cemented. The rig, located more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Venice off Louisiana's coast, sunk after erupting into flames from a blowout. BP Spuds Macondo Well Type: Drilling Operations Feb. 2010 - BP leased another rig, the Deepwater Horizon semisub, to complete drilling operations on the well. The semisub commenced drilling on February 3, 2010. Transocean Marianas Halts Drilling on Macondo Site, Undergoes Repairs Type: Drilling Operations Nov. 2009 - On October 21, 2009, the Transocean Marianas arrived on location to spud an exploration well.
