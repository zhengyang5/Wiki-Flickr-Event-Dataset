Crews were working Sunday at the site of a wrecked drilling platform to try to stop a leak that is pouring 1,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico.
Oil continued to leak underwater Sunday at the site where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on Tuesday.
The oil spill has been growing, with the oily sheen on the surface of the water covering about 1,500 square kilometres on Sunday.
In case that doesn't work, BP PLC, which leased the Deepwater, moved another deepwater rig, the DD3, toward the explosion site.
U.S. Coast Guard officials said weather conditions for the next three days would help keep the spill away from the coast.
