Perry said the oil droplets in the water "are just the right size that probably in the process of swimming or respiring, they're brought into that cavity."
"Unlike heavy metals that biomagnify as they go up the foodchain, oil doesn't seem to do that," she said.
Dispersant, he explained, "doesn't make the oil go away, it just puts it from one part of the ecosystem into another."
Diaz also expressed concern that dispersed oil droplets could end up doing great damage to the Gulf's many undersea coral reefs.
A key data point for scientists is the ratio of dispersant to oil, she said, and "if you don't know the flow rate of the oil, you don't know what you dispersant to oil ratio is."
