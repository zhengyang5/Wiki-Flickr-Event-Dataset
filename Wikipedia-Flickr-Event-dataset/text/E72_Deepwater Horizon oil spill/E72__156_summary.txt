In the new study, the researchers also found that moderate to severe lung disease was five times more likely in the Barataria Bay dolphins than those in Florida.
A quarter of the Barataria Bay dolphins also were significantly underweight.
Those included additional tests of animals in Barataria Bay and Sarasota Bay, as well as in Mississippi and Alabama waters.
The study points out, however, that dolphin deaths actually began being reported in February 2010, before the BP oil spill.
"But we cannot rule out the role of BP oil in this unusual mortality event."
