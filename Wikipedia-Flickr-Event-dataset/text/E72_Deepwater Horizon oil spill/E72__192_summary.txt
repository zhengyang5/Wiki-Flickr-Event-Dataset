LONDON (Reuters) - Shrinking British oil company BP Plc (BP.L) announced quarterly profit down a fifth from a year ago, after it sold assets in preparation for what could be its biggest oil spill payout when the case comes to trial later this month.
Before tax, underlying profit was $5.098 billion down from $7.179 billion, broadly in line with forecasts.
