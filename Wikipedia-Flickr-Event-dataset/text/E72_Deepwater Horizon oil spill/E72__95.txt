DISPERANTS: Chemicals BP used may cause cancer

Abstract (Document Summary)

The report indicates that the 1.8 million gallons of oil dispersants -- including Corexit 9500 and 9527 -- sprayed on or dumped into the Gulf of Mexico after the spill could contain cancer-causing agents, endocrine-disrupting chemicals and hazardous toxins. [...] the chemicals mixed with the sweet Louisiana crude that flowed into the Gulf for 87 days from the Deepwater Horizon oil well may have created a brew that is more harmful to marine life, humans and the environment than the oil.
