The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, caused by a blast on the BP operated rig on April 22, has been described as one the worst ecological disasters in U.S. history.
According to Filipchuk, the cleanup operation in the Gulf of Mexico will take at least a year.
Oil recycling products will be used to build roads and produce hydro- and thermal insulation materials in the United States.
