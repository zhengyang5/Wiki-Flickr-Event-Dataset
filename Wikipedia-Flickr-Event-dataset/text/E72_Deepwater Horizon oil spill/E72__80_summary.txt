The BP oil rig exploded in 2010, killing 11 workers and sending a total estimated 206 million gallons of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico for three months before it was capped.
Tests confirmed the oil came from the infamous Macondo well underneath the Deepwater Horizon.
The company and the Coast Guard said it wasn't feasible to clean up the slick, and that it didn't pose a risk to the shoreline.
"My concern is that substantial amounts of oil could still be leaking from the wreckage," Markey told CBS News.
The Coast Guard canceled an interview with CBS News at the last minute on Wednesday.
