Last night Obama bullied BP into setting up a Â£13bn fund to compensate U.S. oil spill victims.
Officially, today's hearing is slated to investigate 'the role of BP in the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico'.
The semi-submersible rig Deepwater Horizon moved into position to resume exploratory operations in February.
Inevitably perhaps, it was owned and operated by Transocean, the largest deepwater oil drilling specialist contractors in the world.
Transocean's Deepwater Horizon rig was built in South Korea by Hyundai Heavy Industries, ten years ago.
