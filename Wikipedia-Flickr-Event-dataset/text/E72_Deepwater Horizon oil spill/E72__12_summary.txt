A BP spokesman, Jason Ryan, said the study offered no evidence that the oil spill had reduced fish populations.
“The oil concentrations used in these lab experiments were rarely seen in the gulf during or after the Deepwater Horizon accident,” he said.
Among other effects, that study said, the chemicals impede the process by which calcium ions in heart muscle prompt regular heartbeats.
Photographs in the latest study depicted what the study called nearly identical physical distortions in the hearts, body shape and eyes of yellowtail and bluefin tuna and amberjack embryos that were exposed to oil.
Bluefin, which were spawning in the area of the spill when it occurred, exhibited the full range of heart defects more often than the two other fish, the study said.
