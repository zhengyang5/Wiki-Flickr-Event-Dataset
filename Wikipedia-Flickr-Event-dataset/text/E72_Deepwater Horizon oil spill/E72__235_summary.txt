The presidential oil spill commission on Wednesday blamed the Gulf of Mexico oil spill last year on "missteps and oversights" by oil giant BP, rig owner Transocean and contractor Halliburton, saying those errors were "rooted in systemic failures" and could happen again.
Though Transocean told the commission the incident was irrelevant, the commission said, "The basic facts of both incidents are the same.
But the most detailed descriptions in the chapter released Wednesday were of communications and decisions by BP, Transocean and Halliburton.
"The immediate cause of the Macondo blowout was a failure to contain hydrocarbon pressures in the well," the report said.
Halliburton issued a statement sharply criticizing the presidential commission and BP.
