The U.S. government temporarily banned oil giant BP from bidding on any new federal contracts as a result of its recent criminal pleas stemming from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
The move prevents BP (BCONQ) from getting new federal government "contracts, grants or other covered transactions," according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which was charged with issuing the ban.
Shares in BP fell earlier in the day, but recouped most of their losses by noon.
BP also agreed to pay $4.5 billion in fines as part of the settlement earlier this month.
In addition to charging BP as a company, the federal government also brought criminal charges against two high ranking BP employees involved with the drilling, who now face jail time if convicted.
