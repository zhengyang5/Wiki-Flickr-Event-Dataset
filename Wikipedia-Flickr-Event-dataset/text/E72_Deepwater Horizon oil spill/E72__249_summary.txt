WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government banned BP Plc on Wednesday from new federal contracts over its "lack of business integrity" in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, possibly imperiling the company's role as a top U.S. offshore oil and gas producer and the No.
1 military fuel supplier.
BP and its affiliates are barred from new federal contracts until they demonstrate they can meet federal business standards, the EPA said.
BP is also the top fuel supplier to the U.S. military, the largest single buyer of oil in the world.
As recently as September, BP affiliates won two military fuel contracts worth as much as $1.37 billion, according to a website that tracks U.S. military contracts.
