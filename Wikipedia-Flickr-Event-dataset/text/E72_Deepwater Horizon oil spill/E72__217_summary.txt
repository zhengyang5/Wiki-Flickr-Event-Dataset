BP buys 'oil spill' sponsored links for search enginesGareth Morgan, technology news editorAs daily clean-up costs to BP spiral to $37 million per day and its chief executive is vilified in the press, the company is trying to fight back - by buying search terms.
So each time someone enters a relevant query - say "oil spill" - into a search engine such as Google, Yahoo or Bing, their results also include a paid-for link from BP.
Typically, these sponsored links sit above the genuine results.
Studies of the effectiveness of sponsored links suggests perhaps as many as 30 per cent of people will head to their marketing material.
BP must hope that its marketing campaign to stem criticism produces results faster than its efforts to stop the leak.
