Chemicals used to break up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill before it reaches shore could do lasting damage to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, environmental scientists say.
Some of the dispersant has been injected directly into the source of the spill on the ocean floor, a technique never deployed before, deepening concerns about further damage to the environment.
But environmental scientists say the dispersants, which can cause genetic mutations and cancer, add to the toxicity of the spill.
That exposes sea turtles and bluefin tuna to an even greater risk than crude alone.
"You are trying to mitigate the volume of the spill with dispersant, but the price you pay is increased toxicity," said Richard Charter, a scientific adviser to Defenders of Wildlife.
