Experts say that the newly discovered oil in Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans is not likely to cause much environmental damage.
But the presence of tar balls and oil sheen so close to the Big Easy is a psychological blow.
"This proves that the oil can come in," said John Lopez, director of coastal sustainability for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation.
By Sunday, evidence of the oil had traveled west, to a narrow waterway known as the Rigolets that feeds into Lake Pontchartrain.
He has tasked a staffer to begin walking the beach daily in search of tar balls.
