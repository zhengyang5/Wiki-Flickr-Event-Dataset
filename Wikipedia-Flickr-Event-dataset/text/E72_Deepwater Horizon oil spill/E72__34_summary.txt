BP has said in the past that it learned of the spill's full extent months after the April 2010 blowout.
Justice Department officials said a probe of individual criminal activity related to the spill is ongoing and may result in more indictments.
Two days later, BP executives told the Coast Guard their best estimate for the leak was 1,000 barrels per day.
A spokesman for BP declined to comment on the emails in Mix's legal briefs, or on the ongoing Justice Department probe.
In its guilty plea in November, BP acknowledged that it misled Congress about the size of the leak.
