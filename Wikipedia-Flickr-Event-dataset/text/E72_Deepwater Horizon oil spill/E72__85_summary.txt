This week, University of South Florida scientists reported oil in amounts that were toxic to critical plankton on the ocean floor far east of the spill.
It noted that the plume was not made up of pure oil but included toxic oil compounds including benzene and xylene.
The NOAA chief Jane Lubchenco, herself an ocean scientist, had played down the first reports of oil in the ocean depths.
MacDonald and other scientists have accused NOAA of discouraging them from making public their findings about lingering oil in the deepwater.
A NOAA spokeswoman said last night that the Woods Hole voyage was in late June, while the broken BP well was still spewing oil.
