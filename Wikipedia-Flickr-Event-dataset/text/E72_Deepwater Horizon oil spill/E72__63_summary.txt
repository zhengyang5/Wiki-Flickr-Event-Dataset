It was the second step in the "static kill," in which heavy mud was first pumped into the well from the surface to stop it from leaking crude into the gulf.
BP said in a statement that the static kill procedure will "complement" a separate effort to plug the well through a relief well that is nearing completion in a technique known as the "bottom kill."
But even the cautious Allen, the official in charge of the federal response to the disaster, called the static kill a "fairly consequential" event and a "very significant step."
Federal scientists have said that vigilance would be called for even after the static kill procedure worked, which, according to BP in a 2 a.m. announcement, it did.
BP sent out a bulletin declaring success after spending eight hours pumping mud into the well from surface ships.
