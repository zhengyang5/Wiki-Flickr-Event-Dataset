Mississippi AG Sues Kenneth Feinbergby Associated PressMississippi's attorney general is suing the administrator of BP's $20 billion oil spill fund to get access to claims filed by coastal residents.
JACKSON, Mississippi - Jim Hood said Tuesday that he has tried to negotiate with the fund's administrator, Washington lawyer Kenneth Feinberg.
He says he's seeking to make the process more transparent so people will know if Feinberg is looking out for the best interests of oil spill victims or BP.
