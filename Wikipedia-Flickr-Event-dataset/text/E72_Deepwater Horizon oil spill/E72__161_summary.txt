BATON ROUGE -- About 565,000 pounds of oiled material from the Deepwater Horizon spill was brought to the surface by Hurricane Isaac, more than had been collected in eight months before the storm, the state's coastal protection agency said Wednesday.
"The Coast Guard should be siding with us and not with BP."
BP officials said last month that they wanted to "deep clean" Louisiana beaches to remove oil and tar.
The plan, which would need approval from state officials, federal agencies and the U.S. Coast Guard, did not come up during Wednesday's meeting.
"Maybe Isaac was a blessing in disguise because it brought to fruition what we thought was going to happen," Young said.
