(The Coast Guard)More than 1,000 scientists and government officials recently met in New Orleans to share the latest research on the effects of the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Host Steve Curwood talks to Mark Schleifstein, a reporter for NOLA.com, the Times Picayune, about what scientists have learned since the largest oil spill in US history.
SCHLEIFSTEIN: Thereâ€™s new research that does show that a combination of dispersant and oil is more toxic than either the dispersant or the oil on their own.
What are we missing from the body of knowledge about this horrific oil spill?
There are concerns about sperm whales, which actually tend to feed about 20 miles away from the oil spill site.
