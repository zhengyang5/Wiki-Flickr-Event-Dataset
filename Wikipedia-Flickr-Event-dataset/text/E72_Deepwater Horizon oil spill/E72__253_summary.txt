(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), North America’s top oilfield services provider, said it reached a $1.1 billion settlement for a majority of claims related to its role in BP Plc’s (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

“We think this is a smart move by Halliburton,” said Stewart Glickman, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ.
A decision is awaited from U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans ascertaining the extent of negligence of BP, Halliburton and rig contractor Transocean Ltd (RIG.N).
Transocean agreed last year to pay $1.4 billion to settle U.S. government charges for its role in the disaster.
