And then we will track the actual mud as it goes in during the static kill against those pressure versus volume lines.
Based on the results of the injectivity test, BP started pumping drilling mud today at 21:00 (UK) and 15:00 (CDT) as part of the static kill operations.
But at the start of the process no-one knows if that channel included flow down through the production casing, flow down through the annulus around the production casing, or both.
The Static Kill will increase the probability that the relief well will work.
The Static Kill is not the end all be all.
