The U.S. Department of Justice is accusing oil company BP of gross negligence and a "culture of corporate recklessness,' in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, a charge that could significantly increase the damages BP could be forced to pay in the case.
The DOJ said that some of the arguments made by BP in earlier filings in the case were "plainly misleading."
The DOJ also said Transocean, the owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig, is guilty of gross negligence as well.
BP has reached a $7.8 billion settlement with lawyers representing private sector victims of the spill.
