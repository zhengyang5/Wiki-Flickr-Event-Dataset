"This marks the single largest criminal fine – $1.25bn – and the single largest total criminal resolution – $4bn – in the history of the United States," the attorney general, Eric Holder, told a news conference in New Orleans.

"This fine amounts to a rounding error for a corporation the size of BP," the environmental group said.
It said the real test of the government's will would come when it came to assessing civil penalties on BP for environmental damage.
The original misquoted attorney general Eric Holder as saying the penalties were the largest criminal fines in history at $1.25m and $4m.
