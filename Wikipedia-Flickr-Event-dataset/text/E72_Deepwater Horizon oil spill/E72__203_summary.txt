By Rajesh MirchandaniBBC News, Los AngelesGovernor Schwarzenegger said he did not want to risk a California oil spillCalifornia's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has withdrawn his support for a plan to expand oil exploration off the state's coast.
He said the spill in the Gulf of Mexico had changed his mind about the safety of oil platforms in the Pacific Ocean.
Last year he pushed for more oil drilling off California's coastline.
But he said after seeing television pictures of the Gulf of Mexico spill he asked himself: "Why would we want to take that kind of risk?"
And Governor Schwarzenegger's change of heart almost ensures no new drilling will be allowed in the state's waters.
