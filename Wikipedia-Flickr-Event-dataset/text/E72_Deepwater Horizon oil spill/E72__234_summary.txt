BP added that it was taking steps to deal with problems identified by the panel.
Halliburton said in a statement that it had acted at BP’s direction in preparing and injecting cement into the well.
It said tests the panel identified as indicating problems with its cement formula were preliminary and did not contribute to the disaster.
Halliburton also criticized the commission for what it called selective omissions of exculpatory material it gave to the panel’s staff.
A spokesman for Transocean said that BP, not Transocean, made the major decisions in the hours before the blowout.
