Trouble aheadAmong the reports more worrisome findings:– Current indicators show continuing double-digit declines in plans to travel to the Gulf Coast region for the next several months.
–The current oil spill crisis puts into jeopardy not only rental income and the ancillary spending of guests, but also real estate values.
– The spills effects reached far beyond the Gulf Coast, impacting beach communities in South Carolina as well as Miami and Fort Lauderdale.
– Interestingly, the report noted when Gulf Coast vacation plans were canceled, destinations in Maine, Massachusetts and North Carolina were tourists top alternatives.
Once regular Gulf Coast tourists experience other seasonal vacation destinations, a considerable number are lost for good.
