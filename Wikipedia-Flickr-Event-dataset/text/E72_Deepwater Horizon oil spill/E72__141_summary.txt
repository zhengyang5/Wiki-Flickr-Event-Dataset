The oil emanating from the seafloor contains about 40 percent methane, compared with about 5 percent found in typical oil deposits, said John Kessler, a Texas A&M University oceanographer who is studying the impact of methane from the spill.
Methane is a colorless, odorless and flammable substance that is a major component in the natural gas used to heat people's homes.
Petroleum engineers typically burn off excess gas attached to crude before the oil is shipped off to the refinery.
That's exactly what BP has done as it has captured more than 7.5 million gallons (28 million liters) of crude from the breached well.
Meanwhile, a specialized flare siphoning oil and gas from a stack of pipes on the seafloor burned roughly 161,700 gallons (612,000 liters).
