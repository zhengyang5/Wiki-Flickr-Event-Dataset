Russian scientists from a research institute in the West Siberian town of Tyumen will help clean up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico under a contract signed with U.S. Global Remediation Group, the institute's marketing specialist said on Tuesday.

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, caused by a blast on the BP operated rig on April 22, has been described as one the worst ecological disasters in U.S. history.

Under a contract signed by the Research and Development Institute of Ecology and the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources (RSI), Tyumen scientists will carry out a set of measures to clean up the leak, recycle waste oil and clean the coast contaminated by the ecological disaster, Elena Filipchuk said.

U.S. companies have looked into several thousand cleanup projects and found the technology offered by Tyumen scientists to be the most efficient, Filipchuk said, adding that RSI had worked for many years in the field of oil spill cleanup.

According to Filipchuk, the cleanup operation in the Gulf of Mexico will take at least a year. Oil recycling products will be used to build roads and produce hydro- and thermal insulation materials in the United States.

RSI was set up in 2005 and specializes in the development of innovation technologies in the field of environmental protection and nature conservation.
