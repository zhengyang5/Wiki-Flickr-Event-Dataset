FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown explained to me that the temporary flight restriction (TFR) zone issued around the Gulf spill was requested by the Coast Guard.
On May 28, however, the FAA issued an addendum to the TFR regarding exceptions to the emergency aircraft restriction.
Furthermore, she says, those journalists who say they were denied flight access were probably working through seaplane companies who did not receive exceptions.
"If they had come through public affairs for the FAA, I would have been working to figure something out," Brown says.
What about the claim that BP is involved in keeping reporters and photographers away from the spill?
