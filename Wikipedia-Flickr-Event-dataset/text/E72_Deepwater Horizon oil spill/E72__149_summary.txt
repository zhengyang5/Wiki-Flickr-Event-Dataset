"It's disturbing what we're seeing," Louisiana Oyster Task Force member Brad Robin told Al Jazeera.
The state of Louisiana oyster season opened on October 15, and we can't find any production out there yet.
According to Robin, entire sectors of the Louisiana oyster harvest areas are "dead or mostly dead".
State of Louisiana statistics confirm that overall seafood catch numbers since the spill have declined.
BP claims that fish lesions are naturally common, and that before the spill there was documented evidence of lesions in the Gulf of Mexico caused by parasites and other agents.
