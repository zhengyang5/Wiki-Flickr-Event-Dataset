BP Plc and Transocean Ltd. face at least 36 lawsuits, including group cases with potentially thousands of plaintiffs, over environmental damage and personal injuries caused by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
BP has the primary liability for damage caused by the spill, said Keith Hall, an attorney in New Orleans, who isn’t involved in the litigation.
He cited a U.S. law passed after the Exxon Valdez oil spill at Alaska in 1989.
“Under the Oil Pollution Act, the fact that it was BP’s oil is enough,” said Hall, of Stone Pigman Walther Wittmann LLC.
Alabama and Florida beachfront property owners filed at least eight suits claiming the spill will damage rental income.
