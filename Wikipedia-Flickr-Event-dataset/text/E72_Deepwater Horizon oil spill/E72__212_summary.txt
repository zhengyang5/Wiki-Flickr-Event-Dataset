Foreign companies have already been restricted from access to US government bail-out money and some important government contracts.
Nancy McLernon, chief executive of the group representing US subsidiaries of foreign companies, believes the BP crisis has only made this trend worse.
The US President, Barack Obama, has repeatedly emphasised BP’s foreign ownership, calling it British Petroleum despite its decades-old change of name.
And Sarah Palin, the Republican former vice-presidential candidate, whose husband worked for BP for 18 years, urged those in the Gulf of Mexico to “learn from Alaska’s lesson with foreign oil companies”.
BP was the majority owner and operator of the oil well that is leaking up to 60,000 barrels of oil a day.
