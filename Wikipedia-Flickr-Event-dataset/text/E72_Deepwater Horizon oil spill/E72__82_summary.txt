The U.S. Coast Guard has released four videos showing portions of a four-day underwater survey in mid-December of the BP Macondo well site and of wreckage of the Deepwater Horizon semisubmersible drilling rig on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico near the well.
On Dec. 18, BP, Transocean and the Coast Guard announced the surveys found no oil coming from the wells or the wreckage.
The four videos, edited by a Coast Guard official and released Friday, were taken from the continuous footage recorded during the four-day survey.
A third video captures an ROVâ€™s survey of the riser pipe that once connected the Macondo wellhead to the Deepwater Horizon rig on the surface.
BP and the Coast Guard earlier this month said that the survey found no additional oil leaking from the container, which had holes in it sealed in October after droplets of oil were discovered floating out of them during an earlier survey.
