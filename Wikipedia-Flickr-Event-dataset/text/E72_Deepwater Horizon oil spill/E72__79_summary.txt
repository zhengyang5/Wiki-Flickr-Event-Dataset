The subsea mission to see if BP's Deepwater Horizon site is leaking oil ended on Saturday, but no results have yet been announced.
The operation, under Coast Guard supervision, began Sunday, Dec. 9, and lasted until Saturday, Dec. 15.
On Monday, the Coast Guard confirmed the inspection was over, but would not release any information.
Markey and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) have been asking BP and the Coast Guard for more information and video regarding the recent incidents.
The Coast Guard has not indicated what the next step would be if no leaks are detected among the Deepwater Horizon wreckage or wells.
