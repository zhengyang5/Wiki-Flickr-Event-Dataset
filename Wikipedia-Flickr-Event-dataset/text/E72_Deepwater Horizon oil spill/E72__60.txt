It was always inconceivable that President Obama would consider using a nuclear explosion to cut the flow of oil from the unrelenting seabed gusher in the Gulf of Mexico — no matter how many other options faltered.

Now it’s simply official, as reported by my colleague Bill Broad: “Nuclear Option on Gulf Oil Spill? No Way, U.S. Says.”

It’s one thing to point to four successful instances in which nuclear explosions were used in the Soviet Union in decades past to seal gas wells after blowouts. (Watch the fascinating video above for relevant archival footage.) It’s another entirely to chart a path to doing so in United States waters.

On May 24, Doug Suttles of BP pretty definitively ruled out conventional explosives, as well, saying that if the company tried blasts to crimp the well and failed, “We would have denied ourselves all other options.”

Of course BP has run through all other options now for stopping the oil and gas flow (it still plans one more method to catch much of the escaping oil); does that mean conventional blasts might end up back on the table?
