Oil dispersant effects remain a mysteryBP sprayed chemicals massively in confronting the gulf spill, but scientists aren't sure how much good — or bad — they did.
Scientists say they still don't know whether dispersants truly enable bacteria to digest spilled oil more quickly or whether dispersed oil is safer for marine life than untreated slicks.
Yet despite more than half a century of dispersant use in oil spill cleanups, the long-term effects that dispersants or dispersant-treated oil have on marine life remain as opaque as a layer of crude.
Just as dishwashing detergent breaks grease on dirty plates into bits, dispersants help turn a slick of oil into droplets a hair's breadth in size.
In droplet form, oil is more easily pulled under by currents, away from birds, otters, seaweed and other marine life near the surface.
