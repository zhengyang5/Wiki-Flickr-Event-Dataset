In a trio of suits against cementing contractor Halliburton, rig owner Transocean, and blowout preventer manufacturer Cameron, BP said safety systems failed and key technology was “unreasonably dangerous”.
The problems had led to $40 billion of costs for BP following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, it said.
US government investigations had established that BP failed to fully adhere to the results of the OptiCem software, which demanded 21 centralisers be used.
BP initially adhered to the software tests and ordered 15 extra centralisers, in addition to the six in place.
Meanwhile, in its lawsuit against Transocean, BP alleged the company’s engineers had “failed to monitor” drilling fluids in the well.
