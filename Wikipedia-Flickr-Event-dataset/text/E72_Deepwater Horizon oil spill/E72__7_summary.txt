Down in the Gulf, oil still is bubbling to the surface near BP’s disastrous Macondo well.
A month ago, the Mobile Press-Register took video and samples of the oil that appeared to bubble up near the Deepwater Horizon site and later were linked directly to BP’s Macondo well.
The oil this time was not near the Macondo well, but it was out there.
Instead people and the press around the world are glued to YouTube videos of new streams of oil drifting near the Macondo well site.
Not by us, anyway.”It looks like the Macondo monkey will have a grip on BP—and the Gulf—for some time to come.
