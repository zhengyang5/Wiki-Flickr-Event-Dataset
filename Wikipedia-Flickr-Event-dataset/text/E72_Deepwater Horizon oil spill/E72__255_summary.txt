In the case, the UK supermajor confronts the US Justice Department and Gulf states for negligence claims and damages to communities in the wake of the spill, which killed 11 workers and caused the worst offshore spill in US history.
Reuters quoted attorney Jim Roy, representing plaintiffs in the case, who alleged the companies' rush to bring production online led to safety lapses that turned deadly.
Profits over safety," Roy said of the companies' motivation according to the news wire.
The trial, already delayed from last year by settlement talks, according to reports escaped a last-minute deal over the weekend despite media attention that will rehash the devastating spill.
The supermajor also set aside $20 billion escrow fund to handle civil claims and restoration work in affected areas.
