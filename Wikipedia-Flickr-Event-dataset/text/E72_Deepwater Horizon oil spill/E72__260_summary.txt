BP has agreed to pay a record environmental fine of $18.7bn to settle legal actions brought by the US and several states over the fatal 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The settlement ends all litigation between BP, the states and the US government and allows the company to pay over 18 years.
“For these two payments alone, Clean Water Act violations and natural resource damages, BP would be getting away with less than half of what the law would justify,” she said.
“We have made significant progress, and with this agreement we provide a path to closure for BP and the Gulf.
“More than five years later, this agreement between the five Gulf states, BP and the department of justice brings real hope for the future of the Gulf Coast.”
