The federal judge overseeing the massive Gulf oil spill litigation on Friday gave final approval to BP's medical settlement for cleanup workers and others who say they got sick from exposure to oil or dispersants in the wake of the accident.
The settlement aims to resolve more than 100,000 claims, which BP estimates could cost about $7.8 billion or more.
However, there is no limit to payouts under the medical settlement, which also includes provisions for individuals to file for benefits in the future, if they are able to show their illnesses were caused by the spill.
"Clean-up workers, coastal residents and the Gulf Coast region at-large will benefit greatly from the myriad programs offered by the Medical Benefits Settlement" the attorneys said in a statement.
