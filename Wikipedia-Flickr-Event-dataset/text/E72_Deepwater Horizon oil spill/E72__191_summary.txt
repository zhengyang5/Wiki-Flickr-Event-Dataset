NEW YORKâ€”BP's settlement deal with thousands of victims of the 2010 Gulf oil spill is a major step toward putting the worst oil spill in U.S. history behind it.
BP says it will not have to increase the $37.2 billion it has set aside to pay for the spill, and analysts say the settlement could allow BP to quickly resolve outstanding claims by states and the federal government.
If approved by the court, the deal would settle lawsuits filed by 100,000 individuals and businesses affected by the spill.
BP expects the settlement to cost $7.8 billion, paid out of a $20 billion trust the company had established to pay these types of claims.
Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said the settlement shows BP is willing to pay in order to try to put the oil spill behind it.
