The disaster led to the biggest oil spill in US history.
Under the CWA, a company involved in an oil spill that is "grossly negligent" can pay up to $4,300 per barrel spilled.
BP says 2.5 million barrels of oil were spilled during 87 days the spill lasted, while the judge says 4.2 million.
In all, BP has put aside $42.5 billion to pay for the spill including $3.5 billion for any civil penalties.
Expectations are that BP may be asked to pay maximum penalty with Barbier having ruled that the 2010 oil spill was the result of negligence.
