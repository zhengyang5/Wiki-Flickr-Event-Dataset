A new study confirms that oil from the Macondo well made it into the ocean's food chain through the tiniest of organisms, zooplankton.
They serve as food for baby fish and shrimp and act as conduits for the movement of oil contamination and pollutants into the food chain.
The researchers were able to identify the signature unique to the Deep Water Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico.
"Furthermore, our work demonstrated that zooplankton in the Northern Gulf of Mexico accumulated toxic compounds derived from the Macondo well."
The team's research indicates that the fingerprint of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill could be found in some zooplankton in the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem at low levels, as much as a month after the leaking wellhead was capped.
