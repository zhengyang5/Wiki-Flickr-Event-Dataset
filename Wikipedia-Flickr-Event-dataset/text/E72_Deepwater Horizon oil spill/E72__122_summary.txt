Bacteria in the gulf mostly digested gas, not oil, study findsThe discovery tempers hopes that microorganisms have eaten up most of the spilled oil in the gulf, as other scientists had recently suggested, the lead author says.
Bacteria that attacked the plumes of oil and gas resulting from the Deepwater Horizon gusher in the Gulf of Mexico mainly digested natural gas spewing from the wellhead — propane, ethane and butane — rather than oil, according to a study published in the journal Science.
They concluded that 70% of oxygen depletion was the result of microbial digestion of these natural gas chemicals, suggesting that most of the bacterial action was against gas, not oil.
"If it's disproportionately natural gas that's being degraded, what's going on with the crude oil components?"
He noted that many organisms that consume propane and butane can also consume other components of oil.
