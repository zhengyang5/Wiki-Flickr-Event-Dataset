The U.S. Coast Guard says new oil spotted 16 miles northeast of the shut-in BP Macondo well is too dispersed to be recovered. The oil was first spotted by On Wings of Care pilot Bonny Schumaker during a flight over the area on Tuesday. Schumaker reported a 10 mile by 4 mile string of oily sheen and thicker material to the Coast Guard National Response Center the same day.

In a web report on her flight, which includes a nine-minute video showing rainbow-colored sheen interspersed with what looks like reddish-orange weathered oil, Shumaker said she contacted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel Okeana Explorer and the MV Sarah Bordelon, which were both in the area of the oil.

The Sarah Bordelon reported to her that it was sampling the oil for BP.

Petty Officer Bill Colclough said today that the Coast Guard is investigating the spill.

"We received a report from the NOAA vessel Okeanos Explorer," he said. "They reported to us that it was a light and silvery sheen and it was an unrecoverable amount, whereupon we conducted an overflight to verify it."

A spokesman from BP dismissed the report.

"It very well could be from natural seeps," said Curtis Thomas. "What we are saying for sure is that it is not from our well head.

"Those statements are based on our examination of the well head as a result of a report last week of a sheen close to the spill area," he said.

That report came from reporters at the Mobile Press-Register, which collected samples of light oil that they saw bubbling to the surface near the Macondo well. The samples were determined by Louisiana State University chemists to match the chemical "fingerprint" of oil released from the Macondo well last year.
