Tony Hayward, chief executive of BP, is to leave the company, bowing to pressure over his handling of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, the aftermath of which has become America's worst environmental disaster.
Hayward, 52, was last night locked in meetings with the BP board about the financial details of his leaving package, but he is expected to go under basic contractual terms.
BP continued to insist "Tony Hayward remains chief executive", and any change to this will be formally announced through the Stock Exchange.
Svanberg was criticised for not doing enough to support his chief executive but the US media targeted Slough-born Hayward, who they described as "the most hated man in America".
Some industry commentators have predicted the demise of BP â€“ once the most peer-respected oil company in the world after ExxonMobil.
