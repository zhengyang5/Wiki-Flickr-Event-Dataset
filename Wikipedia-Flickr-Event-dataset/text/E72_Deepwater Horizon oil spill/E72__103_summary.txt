But questions linger over BP's use of underwater dispersants in the Gulf oil spill.
A shrimp boat skims the water's surface in the Gulf oil spill Monday.
BP reported moderate success in its attempt to siphon some oil from the source of the leak on the sea floor.
The siphon is collecting 1,000 barrels of oil a day – roughly one-fifth of the oil leaking from the wellhead, by BP’s estimates, though some scientists suggest the amount of oil leaking in the Gulf oil spill could be much greater.
Further testing will be needed to verify the cause of the undersea oil clouds and what can be done to deal with them.
