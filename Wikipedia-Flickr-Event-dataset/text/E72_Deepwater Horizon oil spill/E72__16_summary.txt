Under its deal with the Justice Department, BP will pay about $4 billion in penalties over five years.
That amount includes $1.256 billion in criminal fines, $2.394 billion to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for remediation efforts and $350 million to the National Academy of Sciences.
Under the settlement announced on Thursday, BP agreed to plead guilty to 11 felony counts of misconduct or neglect related to the deaths in the explosion.
It also agreed to plead guilty to one felony count of obstruction of Congress over its statements about the flow rate.
With an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled in the accident, the company faces liabilities of as much as $5.4 billion to $21 billion.
