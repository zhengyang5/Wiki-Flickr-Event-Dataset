Federal officials arrested a former BP engineer on charges of obstruction of justice on Tuesday, in the first criminal charges filed in connection with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Throughout the spill, BP consistently provided flow estimates to the government and public that were later revealed to be far lower than the actual discharge from the well.
Mix faces up to 20 years in prison on the felony obstruction of justice charges and up to $500,000 in fines, according to the Justice Department.
Throughout the spill, BP officials told Congress and the public that the company lacked the technical ability to measure flow from the deep-sea gusher.
