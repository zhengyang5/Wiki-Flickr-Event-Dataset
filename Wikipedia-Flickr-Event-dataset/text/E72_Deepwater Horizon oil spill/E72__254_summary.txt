The end is in sight for the civil trial of BP and its partners in the ill-fated Macondo oil and gas exploration well, but not before the British oil giant has its day in court.
Seven weeks in, BP will begin presenting its defense Monday (April 8) in the sprawling Gulf of Mexico oil spill trial, which will determine liability and fines potentially worth tens of billions of dollars in the 2010 fire and explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 workers and soiled beaches and marshes from Louisiana to Florida.
"The more fault that's attributed to the subcontractors, the less likely there is to be a finding of gross negligence by BP," he said.
"And if there's no gross negligence by BP, there's less of a chance of punitive damages being awarded."
But for BP, LeCesne believes it could be death-by-a-thousand-cuts.
