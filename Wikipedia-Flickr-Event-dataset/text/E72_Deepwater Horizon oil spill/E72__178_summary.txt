New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A fisherman who was hospitalized after becoming ill while cleaning up oil in the Gulf of Mexico has filed a temporary restraining order in federal court against oil company BP.
John Wunstell Jr., is asking BP to give the workers masks and not harass workers who publicly voice their health concerns.
The restraining order requests that BP refrain from "altering, testing or destroying clothing or any other evidence or potential evidence" when workers become ill.Graham MacEwen, a spokesman for BP, said he could not comment on the restraining order, or on allegations that BP confiscated clothing.
"The BP oil spill wiped out their professions and their jobs this year and possibly years down the road," Klick said.
The restraining order requests that BP stop using dispersants without providing "appropriate personal protective equipment" to workers.
