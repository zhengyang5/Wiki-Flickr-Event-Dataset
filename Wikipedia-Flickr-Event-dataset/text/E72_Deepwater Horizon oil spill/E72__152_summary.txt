Evidence 'compelling' that explosion at Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in 2010 badly damaged colonies in the Gulf of MexicoDeep sea corals appear to have been seriously harmed by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, according to scientists.
A survey of one site near the well in the Gulf of Mexico uncovered "compelling evidence" of pollution damage.
Scientists looked at 11 deep-water coral sites three to four months after the well head was capped.
But at one site, seven miles south-west of the well, coral colonies presented "widespread signs of stress", including bleaching and tissue loss.
The scientists wrote: "The presence of recently damaged and deceased corals beneath the path of a previously documented plume emanating from the Macondo well provides compelling evidence that the oil impacted deep-water ecosystems."
