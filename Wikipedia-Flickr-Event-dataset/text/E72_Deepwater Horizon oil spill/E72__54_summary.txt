The latest attempt to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil leak has failed, the oil giant BP has said.
In the failed procedure - known as "top kill" - the firm had been blasting waste material and heavy mud into a ruptured well.
The worst oil spill in US history began when a drilling rig exploded and sank last month, killing 11 people.
Pollution fearsMr Suttles said BP had determined that the "top kill" method - which had been going on since Wednesday - had failed after studying the results for three days.
An initial plan to place a 125-tonne dome over the leak failed when it became blocked with ice crystals.
