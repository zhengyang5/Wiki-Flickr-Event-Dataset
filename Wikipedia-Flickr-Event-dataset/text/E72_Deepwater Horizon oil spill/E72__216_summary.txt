Be careful where you click, especially if you're looking for news on the BP oil spill.
A simple Google search of "oil spill" turns up several thousand news results, but the first link, highlighted at the very top of the page, is from BP.
Scott Slatin, an analyst who runs search engine marketing company Rivington in New York, estimates the company is paying upwards of $10,000 per day to maintain the various search terms.
In addition to purchasing the search terms, BP also released a television ad earlier this week featuring CEO Tony Hayward.
"The search terms, everything, it's probably not a bad idea for the company to do," he said.
