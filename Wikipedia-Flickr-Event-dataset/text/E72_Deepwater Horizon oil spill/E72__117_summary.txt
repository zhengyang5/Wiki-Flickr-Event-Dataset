The massive "A Whale" oil skimmer has effectively been beached after it proved inefficient in sucking up oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill.
He said BP's use of chemical dispersants prevented A Whale, billed as the world's largest skimmer, from collecting a "significant amount" of oil during a week of testing that ended Friday.
After oily water flows through intake vents cut into the ship's bow, it is pumped into a series of tanks, where oil rises to the top.
TMT had hired a top-flight New York public relations firm to drum up support for the 10-story-tall, 1,100-foot-long ship that it boasted could process 21 million gallons oily water a day.
"We intend to put what we have learned to good use as part of a global solution to oil spill response wherever future incidents may occur," Su said.
