Federal officials have expressed the need for more toxicology studies on the dispersants, and whether dispersed oil is any less of a threat than non-dispersed oil.
The exact chemical composition of the dispersants being used is not public information, but the products are called Corexit 9527 and Corexit 9500.
Corexit 9527 was used in the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez spill, and contains 2-butoxyethanol, a chemical solvent that is used in paint thinners and varnish removers, among other products.
The data material safety sheets for both Corexit 9527 and Corexit 9500 advise "Do not contaminate surface water," under the heading "Environmental Precautions."
Greenwire's Paul Quinlan reported that 12 EPA-approved dispersants were more effective on southern Louisiana crude, and some of those were less toxic than the Corexit products.
