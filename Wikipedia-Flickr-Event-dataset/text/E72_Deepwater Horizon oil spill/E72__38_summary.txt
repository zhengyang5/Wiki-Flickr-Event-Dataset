TEXAS CITY, Texas -- Tar balls from the Gulf oil spill found on a Texas beach were confirmed Monday as the first evidence that gushing crude from the Deepwater Horizon well has reached all the Gulf states.
About five gallons of tar balls were found Saturday on the Bolivar Peninsula, northeast of Galveston, said Capt.
"So far it's scattered stuff showing up, mostly tar balls," said Louisiana Office of Fisheries Assistant Secretary Randy Pausina.
The discovery of the tar balls in Texas provoked a quick dispatch of cleaning crews and a vow that BP will pick up the tab.
"Any Texas shores impacted by the Deepwater spill will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab," Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said.
