Such microorganisms are a big reason why BP's 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was not far worse.
"The microbes did a spectacular job of eating a lot of the natural gas," says biogeochemist Chris Reddy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
The relatively small hydrocarbon molecules in natural gas are the easiest for microorganisms to eat.
Ocean currents, in addition to keeping the spilled oil offshore, spurred microbial activity amidst the oil spill.
But even the ravenous microbes could not clean it allâ€”and much of what they consumed (natural gas components like methane, ethane, butane, propane and pentane) does not legally count as part of the oil spill.
