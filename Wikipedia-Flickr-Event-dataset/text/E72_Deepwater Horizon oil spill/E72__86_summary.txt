I collected over 1,000 tar balls within [an area of] about 10 miles (16 kilometers) in five hours.
But many beaches exhibit no tar balls, and even on beaches where tar balls do appear periodically, they aren't present all the time.
That may be because omnipresent BP crews pick up the tar balls whenever they appear, he said.
As Unified Command reports make clear, the BP tar balls are 80 percent sand and break up easily.
