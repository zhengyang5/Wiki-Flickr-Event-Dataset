A recent report by the US Travel Association predicts the economic losses for Gulf Coast businesses and individuals could top $23 billion over the next three years.

The spill is impacting a five-state region that generates $34 billion a year in tourism dollars and sustains some 400,000 jobs. And of that $34 billion, Florida generates more than $20 billion in visitor spending, with more than 30,000 tourist-related jobs in the Panhandle.

Trouble ahead

Among the reports more worrisome findings:

– Current indicators show continuing double-digit declines in plans to travel to the Gulf Coast region for the next several months.

– A review of disasters (think Exxon Valdez) impacting tourism destinations shows that the impact endures beyond the resolution of the crisis itself due to the brand damage and ongoing traveler misperceptions.

–The current oil spill crisis puts into jeopardy not only rental income and the ancillary spending of guests, but also real estate values.

– TripAdvisor, a leading travel website featuring consumer reviews of hotels, said over a 20-day period between June 28 and July 18, consumers looking for hotel accommodations searched 52 percent less for Pensacola, 65 percent less for Gulf Shores, Ala., and 48 percent less for Destin.

Even Fort Myers Beach and Key Largo saw declines of 29 percent and 14 percent during that 20-day period.

– The spills effects reached far beyond the Gulf Coast, impacting beach communities in South Carolina as well as Miami and Fort Lauderdale.

– Interestingly, the report noted when Gulf Coast vacation plans were canceled, destinations in Maine, Massachusetts and North Carolina were tourists top alternatives.

And therein lies a huge problem. Once regular Gulf Coast tourists experience other seasonal vacation destinations, a considerable number are lost for good.

Paid for by BP

OK, so the report told us in detail what we know all too well: Oil spills hurt tourism and destroy jobs.

So, whats to be done about it?

The report suggests a very big ticket answer: A $500 million marketing and advertising campaign to win back skittish tourists.

The critical part of the recovery strategy should include a robust communications and marketing plan for the entire region, the report noted.

If the $500 million campaign  funded by BP, of course  were put into effect, it could reduce the economic impact by as much as $7.5 billion, and cut recovery time to between 18 and 24 months.

Theres $20 billion sitting in BPs oil spill escrow fund.

The Pensacola Bay Area  the epicenter of the spill for weeks  should be right there at the front of the line.
