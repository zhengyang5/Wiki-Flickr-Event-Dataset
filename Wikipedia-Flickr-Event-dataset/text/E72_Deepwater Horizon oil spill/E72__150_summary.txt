"The IUCN Red List data has an unmatched, so far neglected potential to inform policy decisions at a regional level."
The researchers consulted the extensive species database of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List, which assesses species' global survival status via a rigorous scientific process.
"There are species that are surely threatened that could be driven to extinction because of this oil spill," says Short.
Among the Red List species that are not protected by U.S. law are the commercially valuable Atlantic bluefin tuna (western stock), 16 species of sharks, and eight corals.
It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List but not protected by the Endangered Species Act.
