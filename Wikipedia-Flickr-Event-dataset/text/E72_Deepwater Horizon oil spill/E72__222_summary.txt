U.S. not accepting foreign help on oil spillWhen State Department spokesman P.J.
Crowley refused to tell reporters which countries have offered assistance to help respond to the BP oil spill, the State Department press corps was flabbergasted.
Late Wednesday evening, the State Department emailed reporters identifying the 13 entities that had offered the U.S. oil spill assistance.
"These offers include experts in various aspects of oil spill impacts, research and technical expertise, booms, chemical oil dispersants, oil pumps, skimmers, and wildlife treatment," the email read.
A State Department official, speaking on background, said that the decision not to initially release the names of offering countries came directly from the State Department leadership.
