The final U.S. government report on last year's massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill came out on Wednesday, and while it puts most of the fault with BP, it passes some blame to Deep Water Horizon operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton, which laid faulty cement in the well.
When that cement job failed after the Deep Water Horizon well exploded in April 2010, the oil began gushing from the ocean floor.
The panel said BP failed to communicate these decisions and the increasing operational risks to Transocean.
While the report recognizes that other companies had roles in the disaster, the panel said that BP was the final decisionmaker.
Even though the bulk of the blame went to BP, The Guardian noted that its share price had jumped on the report's release because it didn't squarely blame the oil giant.
