WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly three-fourths of oil from the BP spill is gone from the Gulf of Mexico, with 26 percent remaining as a sheen or tarballs, buried in sediment or washed ashore, U.S. scientists said on Wednesday.
The report found 33 percent of the oil has been dealt with by the Unified Command, which includes government and private efforts.
Natural processes broke down the rest of the 74 percent that has been removed from the Gulf.
Paul Anastas, of EPA’s office of research and development, acknowledged there are “environmental tradeoffs” to consider when using dispersants.
Anastas told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that dispersants are generally less toxic than oil, cut the risk to shorelines and degrade quickly, in days or weeks.
