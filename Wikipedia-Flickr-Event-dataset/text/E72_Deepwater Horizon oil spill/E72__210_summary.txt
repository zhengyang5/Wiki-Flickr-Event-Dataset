Oil and gas industry creates offshore safety institute Houston-based operation will be independent, industry's API vowsThe oil and gas industry's main trade group will launch a new, Houston-based offshore safety institute, similar to a recommendation by a presidential commission that investigated the Deepwater Horizon accident.
The new Center for Offshore Safety will be operated by the American Petroleum Institute but walled off from the trade group's lobbying work.
It will fall under API's global industry standards group, which has a decades-long history establishing guidelines and standards for industry equipment and practices.
The safety institute would be subject to independent, third-party auditing and verification to ensure its integrity, API said.
Industry congratulatedReilly praised the creation of the safety institute in a prepared statement on Thursday, which didn't address the independence issue.
