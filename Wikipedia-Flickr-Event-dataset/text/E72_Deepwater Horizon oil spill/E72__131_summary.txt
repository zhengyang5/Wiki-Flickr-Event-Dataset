Last week, Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, tried to bring a small group of journalists with him on a trip he was taking through the gulf on a Coast Guard vessel.
Mr. Nelsonâ€™s office said the Coast Guard agreed to accommodate the reporters and camera operators.
In the first few weeks after the oil rig explosion, BP kept a tight lid on images of the oil leaking into the gulf.
The Coast Guard said later that it was disappointed to learn of the incident.
Media access in disaster situations is always an issue.
