In the case, the UK supermajor confronts the US Justice Department and Gulf states for negligence claims and damages to communities in the wake of the spill, which killed 11 workers and caused the worst offshore spill in US history.

The companies, which heaped lawsuits on one another in the wake of the spill, will also hash out before Judge Carl Barbier the sequence of events that led to the spill and determine blame for the various aspects, with tens of billions in damages potentially at stake.

Reuters quoted attorney Jim Roy, representing plaintiffs in the case, who alleged the companies' rush to bring production online led to safety lapses that turned deadly.

"Production over protection. Profits over safety," Roy said of the companies' motivation according to the news wire.

The trial, already delayed from last year by settlement talks, according to reports escaped a last-minute deal over the weekend despite media attention that will rehash the devastating spill.

BP has already paid handsomely to resolve other aspects of the case, including a $4.5 billion criminal plea agreement on manslaughter charges with the Justice Department and an estimated $8.5 billion agreement with hundreds of plaintiffs signed last year.

The supermajor also set aside $20 billion escrow fund to handle civil claims and restoration work in affected areas.
