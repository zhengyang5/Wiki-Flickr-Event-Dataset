A southerner with a steely core, Dudley was drafted in as a safe pair of hands to deal with the aftermath of the BP oil spill in April

The American chosen to replace Tony Hayward as chief executive of BP is a soft-spoken southerner with a steely core who battled it out with Vladimir Putin in Russia before taking on the Gulf of Mexico cleanup job for BP.

Bob Dudley has been in the oil industry most of his life but joined the BP board only 18 months ago – with the title of managing director and a salary of £1.5m. He was drafted in as a safe pair of hands to deal with the environmental mess triggered by the blowout on board the Deepwater Horizon on 20 April.

Dudley, who worked for Amoco before it was swallowed by BP in a mega-merger, shot to prominence when he was at the centre of a huge row between BP and Russian shareholders inside their joint venture group, TNK-BP.

An increasingly politicised dispute saw the modern version of the KGB raiding the TNK offices in Moscow and a Siberian court refusing visas to BP staff. In June 2008, Dudley left Russia in haste when his visa was not renewed, saying later he had faced "sustained harassment" from the Russian authorities.

Dudley, who has been married to his wife Mary for 30 years and has two children,is a chemical engineering graduate from the University of Illinois and also holds an MBA from Southern Methodist University.

Hayward previously described Dudley as "the management team's foreign secretary". He will need top diplomatic skills if he is to repair the damage done to BP's reputation.
