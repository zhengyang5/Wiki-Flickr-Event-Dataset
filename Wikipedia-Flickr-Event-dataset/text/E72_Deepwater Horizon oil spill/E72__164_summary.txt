On Wings of Care A surface slick seen in aerial photos taken on Jan. 27 near the site of the 2010 BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is more than seven miles long.
Since then, BP has inspected the well site four times with underwater robots and found it secure.
That suggests, she explained, that the source of the sheen is "residual material coming from the wreckage."
Whatever the source, the volume of oil coming to the surface is no cause for alarm, MacDonald noted.
There are many natural seeps in the Gulf of Mexico that produce similar-sized persistent surface sheens.
