Transocean and Halliburtion, BP's partners on the blown-out well that led to the massive Gulf oil spill, reject findings in a new BP report that finds their workers partly to blame for the rig accident.
Failures by BP's own staff to correctly evaluate negative-pressure tests were part of the problem, the report said.
But it also cited roles played by crews of Transocean, which operated the Deepwater Horizon rig, and of Halliburton, the company that cemented the well.
In both its design and construction, BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk â€“ in some cases, severely," Transocean said in a statement.
Transocean personnel, too, might have averted disaster, the BP report continued.
