Crews started pumping cement Friday deep under the seafloor to permanently plug BP's blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico.
It was expected to flow for several hours and then take up to 24 hours to set, according to BP.
The pumping of cement followed the successful intersection late Thursday between a relief well drilled nearly 2.5 miles beneath the floor of the Gulf and the blown-out well.
An April 20 explosion killed 11 workers, sank a drilling rig and led to the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.
BP took some of the blame for the Gulf oil disaster in an internal report issued earlier this month, acknowledging among other things that it misinterpreted a key pressure test of the well.
