Williams.etal.2011.Underestimating.cetacean.mortality_DeepwaterHorizon.BP.incident.Conservation.LettersAnimal Carcasses Recovered Represent a Small Fraction of FatalitiesThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 devastated the Gulf of Mexico ecologically and economically.
However, a new study published in Conservation Letters reveals that the true impact of the disaster on wildlife may be gravely underestimated.
The study argues that fatality figures based on the number of recovered animal carcasses will not give a true death toll, which may be 50 times higher than believed.
The Deepwater disaster took place 40 miles offshore, in 1500m of water, which is partly why estimates of oil flow rates during the spill were so difficult to make.
