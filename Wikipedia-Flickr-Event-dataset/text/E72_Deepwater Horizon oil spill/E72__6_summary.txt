He explained that the samples were analysed and compared to "the known Macondo oil fingerprint, and it was a very, very close match".
"Research shows the Macondo area is ripe for seeps, and I think that's what we're looking at here, and it's coming from the same reservoir," Burton said.
Burton is also the Federal On-Scene Coordinator for this region of the Gulf of Mexico that includes the Macondo area.
During the September over flight of the oil, Al Jazeera spotted two BP research vessels in the area in question.
"These vessels are conducting research on natural oil seeps as part of the Natural Resources Damage Assessment [NRDA] process," Tom Mueller, a press officer with BP America, told Al Jazeera.
