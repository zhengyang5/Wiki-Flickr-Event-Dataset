Bravo honcho and openly gay television personality Andy Cohen is boycotting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Russia because he believes it is "unsafe" for him to visit the anti-gay country.
Cohen, who co-hosted the 2012 Miss Universe pageant with Giuliana Rancic in Las Vegas, told Rancic he will not be returning for the Nov. 9 show in Moscow.
"[T]heir discriminatory policies make it unsafe for the gays who live there and gays coming to work or visit," he told the E!
Francesco Pascuzzi, a gay Miss Universe fan from New Jersey, has started an online petition on Change.org to get the 2013 Miss Universe pageant moved from Russia.
“Andy Cohen’s decision to boycott hosting the Miss Universe pageant sends a very loud and clear message that Russia needs to be held accountable for its brutal and violent crackdown on gay rights," he said in a statement sent to The Huffington Post.
