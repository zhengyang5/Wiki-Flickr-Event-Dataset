Because of these instances, Pascuzzi said, Russia is no longer a safe place for the Miss Universe Organization to host its pageant.
"Allowing Russia to host Miss Universe 2013 pushes us back years and years.
And Tori Helle, of Waldoville, Kansas, also said allowing the pageant to be held in Russia undermines the organization's reputation.
"To allow the Miss Universe Pageant to be held in Russia not only undermines the previous showing of equality support, it does definitely undermine the organizations reputation as well."
Requests for comment left for Miss Universe representatives were not immediately returned Thursday morning.
