Rob Kim / TodayOpenly gay MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts will host the 2013 Miss Universe competition in Russia, replacing Bravo star Andy Cohen, who turned the host position down because he’s “concerned for his safety” as a gay man in a country with anti-gay laws.
Let people see I am no different than anyone else.”On MSNBC Live Friday morning, Roberts discussed the decision with Miss Universe pageant co-owner Donald Trump.
He would like to show his support to the LGBT community in Russia that "does and will continue to exist."
The Miss Universe Organization issued a statement that the laws are “diametrically opposed to the core values” of the pageant in August.
Above all, Roberts insisted that the most important reason for hosting the pageant is to send a message of hope.
