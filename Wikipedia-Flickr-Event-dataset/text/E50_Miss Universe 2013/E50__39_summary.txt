It doesn’t take a lot for the Thais to throw full support behind their Miss Universe Thailand winners, just like what they did to 2012’s Farida Waller and 2013’s Chalita Yaemwannang.
On the darker side, some resourceful pageant fans dug up dirt and even got clips of her swearing (in Thai).
The worst part is that they don’t care at all how Fai will be trained or transformed for Miss Universe.
In short, they all have already switched allegiance to the upcoming Miss Thailand World 2014 where hopes are high that the genuinely best will win.
For now, the new miss Thailand Universe is trying to pick up the pieces of a slowly shattering start of her reign and is promising to rise above it all and do the Land of Smiles proud.
