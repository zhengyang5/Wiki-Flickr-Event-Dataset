Miss Universe 2013 of Albania and Kosovo will not participate in the final competition in Moscow, because of the Russian authoritiesâ€™ decision to prevent the participation of the representative of Kosovo as Russia has not recognized Kosovo as a state, Koha Ditore reported.

Renowned Albanian photographer Fadil Berisha, the official event photographer, said that Albanian representative Fiorabla Dizdari withdrawn from the competition after it was decided that Miss Universe Kosovo Mirjeta Shala can not participate.

Koha Ditore said that names of the two Albanian girls are not on the official website of Miss Universe, although Shala, it is said, in some online forums figured as one of the favorites.

A year ago, 61st edition of the world contest for Miss Universe was held on December 19th in Las Vegas. Albania was represented by Adrola Dushi and Kosovo by Dijana Avdi, who was among the 16 most beautiful girls.
