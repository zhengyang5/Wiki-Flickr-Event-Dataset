From 51 to the one and only Miss USA 2013: Congratulations, Miss Connecticut Erin Brady!

Reigning Miss USA Nana Meriwether has relinquished her crown – and the posh New York apartment that comes with it – to her successor.

Brady, 25, will become a spokeswoman for breast and ovarian cancer awareness and travel the world for various charity work. The first runner-up, Miss Alabama Mary Margaret McCord, will take over should Brady not be able to complete her duties.

The second through fifth runners-up were Miss Illinois Stacie Juris, Miss Utah Marissa Powell, Miss Texas Ali Nugent and Miss South Carolina Megan Pinckney.

At the top of the show, the final 15 were announced after being chosen based on competitions and interviews during the week leading up to the telecast.

They included: Texas, South Carolina, California, Ohio, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Massachusetts, North Carolina, West Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Nevada, Connecticut and Utah.

But Miss Connecticut USA wasn’t the night’s only winner. Miss Oregon Gabrielle Neilan was named Miss Congeniality, and Miss Utah Marissa Powell took Miss Photogenic honors.

Last year, Olivia Culpo became the first Miss USA to ascend to Miss Universe in 16 years. Meriwether, who had been first runner-up, took over for her for the remainder of the year.

Miss Universe will take place in Moscow on Nov. 9.
