From 51 to the one and only Miss USA 2013: Congratulations, Miss Connecticut Erin Brady!
The second through fifth runners-up were Miss Illinois Stacie Juris, Miss Utah Marissa Powell, Miss Texas Ali Nugent and Miss South Carolina Megan Pinckney.
But Miss Connecticut USA wasn’t the night’s only winner.
Miss Oregon Gabrielle Neilan was named Miss Congeniality, and Miss Utah Marissa Powell took Miss Photogenic honors.
Last year, Olivia Culpo became the first Miss USA to ascend to Miss Universe in 16 years.
