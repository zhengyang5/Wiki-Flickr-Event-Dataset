It doesn’t take a lot for the Thais to throw full support behind their Miss Universe Thailand winners, just like what they did to 2012’s Farida Waller and 2013’s Chalita Yaemwannang.

But the minute they smell something fishy and end up seeing someone they feel undeserving of the crown actually getting the same, they are just as extreme in withdrawing their support for their rep. And this is what’s happening with Weluree Ditsayabut who was crowned just last Saturday.

It doesn’t help that the girl is also hugging the news with her anti-red shirt quips. There are also floating remarks about all the negative qualities of Fai (Weluree’s nick). A Thai friend I chatted with mentioned that the finals was allegedly a big cooking show because the winner used to be a host in a teen show for Channel 3 (the airing network). And now that she won and has become ‘popular’ overnight, they will be showing a TV drama filmed before she joined the pageant. On the darker side, some resourceful pageant fans dug up dirt and even got clips of her swearing (in Thai). I was also told that she allegedly wears a tattoo on her breast.

The worst part is that they don’t care at all how Fai will be trained or transformed for Miss Universe. They don’t even care about what National Costume or Evening Gown she will wear. In short, they all have already switched allegiance to the upcoming Miss Thailand World 2014 where hopes are high that the genuinely best will win.

For now, the new miss Thailand Universe is trying to pick up the pieces of a slowly shattering start of her reign and is promising to rise above it all and do the Land of Smiles proud. We’ll see about that.
