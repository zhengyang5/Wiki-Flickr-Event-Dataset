Should Miss Universe 2013 Get Out of Moscow?
The Miss Universe Organization, owned by American tycoon Donald Trump, is scheduled to hold its 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow, Russia on November 9, according to the Associated Press.
"Many Miss Universe fans, myself included, identify as LGBTQ," writes Pascuzzi in the petition.
With this petition, we are asking the Miss Universe Organization to send a strong message in favor of equality and human rights by pulling out from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow."
Donald Trump, who formally acquired the Miss Universe Organization in 2003, has not commented on the petition, but did come under fire last year for excluding a transgender woman from Canada in the competition.
