REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschYet despite three-and-a-half years of debt and banking turmoil, with bailouts totaling more than 400 billion euros, northern euro zone taxpayers have not actually lost a cent.
But the truth remains that German taxpayers, as well as those in Finland, the Netherlands and elsewhere, are no worse off at all, and their finance ministries have racked up savings.
For any euro zone country that has provide bailout assistance to lose money, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain or Cyprus would have to default on the loans they have received.
Greece, which has received 166 billion euros in bailout loans, poses the biggest risk, but even that is changing.
Officials said that even if any of the bailed-out countries were to not pay back some of the money borrowed from euro zone governments, the alternative — a euro zone break-up — would have been a much costlier affair than any bailout losses.
