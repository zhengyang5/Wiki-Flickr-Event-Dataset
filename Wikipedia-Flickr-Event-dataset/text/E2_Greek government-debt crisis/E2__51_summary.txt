BERLIN (Reuters) - Greece’s debt crisis cannot be solved without larger write downs on Greek debt and governments are trying to persuade banks to accept this, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Sunday, just days ahead of a key EU summit.

But it faces resistance from banks over plans for a greater private sector participation in Greek debt restructuring and moves to force banks to raise capital.
Asked in the interview with ARD whether there could be a Greek debt write-down of as much as 50-60 percent, Schaeuble said: “A lasting solution for Greece is not possible without a debt write-down, and this will likely have to be higher than that considered in the summer.”In July, private creditors agreed to a voluntary write-down of 21 percent on their Greek debt, a figure which now looks insufficient.
“We simply have to recognize that banks don’t trust each other at the moment, which is why the interbank market doesn’t function as it should.
