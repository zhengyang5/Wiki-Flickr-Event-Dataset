“But we do not know in what city or which bank it is located in Switzerland,” Varoufakis said.
The finance minister, a key player in the Greek government as it struggles to reach an agreement with the European Union to finance its debt, said it was impossible to obtain such information from Swiss authorities.
But Varoufakis warned that a Grexit (Greek exit from the euozone) would have a negative impact on Switzerland.
