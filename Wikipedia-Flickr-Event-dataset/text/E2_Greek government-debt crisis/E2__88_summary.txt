The Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) said on April 15 it approved the 1.33-billion-euro offer submitted by a consortium of investors for Eurobankâ€™s capital increase.
The approval signals the completion of the first (cornerstone investor) phase covering 46.5 percent of the announced equity raising of 2.86 billion euros.
The group of investors includes Fairfax, WLR Funds, Capital Research and Management Funds, Mackenzie Funds, Fidelity Funds and Brookfield.
The capital injection of 1.33 billion euros makes those anchor investors Eurobank's second largest shareholder, controlling a stake of 29.6 percent.
Both transactions aim to raise the 1.53 billion euros not covered by the anchor investors.
