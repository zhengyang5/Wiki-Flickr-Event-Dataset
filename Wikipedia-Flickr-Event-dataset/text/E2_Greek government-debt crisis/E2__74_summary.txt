Paul Kazarian, who owns around 4 billion dollars in value of Greek state bonds, says that the Greek debt is not as high as we are made to believe.
The American-Armenian investor, founder and owner of Japonica Partners, spoke to Greek Reporter where he explained his accounting technique, according to which Greece is rated as A+.
When the Greek bonds were rated junk, Kazarian bought billions of dollars in Greek bonds, according to his company’s legal disclosure.
When credit agencies were burying Greece, Kazarian saw a great opportunity.
According to Kazarian, Greece must prove what the real level of its state debt is “based on internationally recognized standards,” because, “it would become apparent that the debt is actually lower than that of other countries.”
