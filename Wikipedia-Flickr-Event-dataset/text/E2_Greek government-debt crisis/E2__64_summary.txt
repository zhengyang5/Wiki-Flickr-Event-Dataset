There was no final agreement between Greece and its lenders on Monday, with eurozone finance ministers viewing the latest proposal by Athens as "positive" but saying that more technical work is needed.
Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem welcomed an updated set of proposals from the Greek government aimed at unblocking the deadlock before the country's bailout program ends on June 30.
The Greek proposals were a “welcome step” noted Dijsselbloem at a press conference following the relatively brief meeting.
A euro area leaders' summit due to take place on Monday evening would go ahead regardless of eurozone finance ministers not being in a position to reach an agreement.
Meanwhile, Greek debt relief measures could be discussed only after the full program is implemented, senior European officials told Kathimerini’s Brussels correspondent Eleni Varvitsiotis.
