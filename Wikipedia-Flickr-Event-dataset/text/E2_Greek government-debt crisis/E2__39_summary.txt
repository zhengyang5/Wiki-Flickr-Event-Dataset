Eurostat, the European Union's statistics arm, said Tuesday that Greece's government budget figures were unreliable and seem to have been falsified to play down a budget crisis that has shaken the EU.
Eurostat said the Greek statistical office NSSG had complained of political interference in the financial figures that were sent to the EU executive in October.
The NSSG is currently controlled by the Greek Finance Ministry.
Revising figures for recent years could see Greece's current debt and deficit figures increase again.
It warned that unless these problems are tackled, "the reliability of Greek deficit and debt will remain in question."
