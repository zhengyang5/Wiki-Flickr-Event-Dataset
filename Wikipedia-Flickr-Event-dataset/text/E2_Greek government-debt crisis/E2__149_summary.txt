REUTERS/Alkis KonstantinidisWorld War Two reparations have resurfaced as an emotional issue in Greece, where many blame Germany, their biggest creditor, for painful austerity and record unemployment associated with two international bailouts.
Gauck said Germany would instead set up a new “Future Fund” to foster the memory of Nazi war crimes in Greece.
Germany denies owing anything to Greece for World War Two after the 115 million deutsche marks it paid in 1960, one of 12 war compensation agreements it signed with Western nations.
Several experts and historians regard the claims put forward by Greek opposition and lobby groups as unfounded or overblown.
