As in the American subprime crisis and the implosion of the American International Group , financial derivatives played a role in the run-up of Greek debt.
Instruments developed by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and a wide range of other banks enabled politicians to mask additional borrowing in Greece, Italy and possibly elsewhere.
Some of the Greek deals were named after figures in Greek mythology.
Aeolos, a legal entity created in 2001, helped Greece reduce the debt on its balance sheet that year.
As part of the deal, Greece got cash upfront in return for pledging future landing fees at the countryâ€™s airports.
