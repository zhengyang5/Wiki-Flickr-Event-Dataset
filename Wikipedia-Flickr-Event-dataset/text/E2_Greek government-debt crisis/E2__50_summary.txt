Still, the ministry said it remained on track to meet its target of cutting the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014.
Greeceâ€™s debt levels were also revised higher, with Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, boosting its estimate of 2009 public debt to 127% of GDP from an earlier estimate of 115%.
Greece expects the debt ratio to hit 144% of GDP for 2010.
The spread on five-year Greek CDS widened 20 basis points to 8.8 percentage points, according to data provider Markit.
That means it would cost $880,000 annually to insure $10 million of Greek debt against default for five years, up from $860,000 on Friday.
