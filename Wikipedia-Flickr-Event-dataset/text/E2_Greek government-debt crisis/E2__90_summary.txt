The older IMF loans carry an interest rate of 3.5 percent, higher than the euro zone rescue fund charges.
THE EURO ZONE - Euro zone governments gave Greece 52.9 billion euros in bilateral loans under the first bailout agreed in 2010, known as the Greek Loan Facility.
That is in addition to their contributions to the IMF loans, commensurate with their respective quotas in the global lender.
They also granted Greece a 10-year moratorium on interest payments on the second bailout loan from the euro zone rescue fund.
But euro zone governments have said they would only discuss that if Athens further tightens its budget.
