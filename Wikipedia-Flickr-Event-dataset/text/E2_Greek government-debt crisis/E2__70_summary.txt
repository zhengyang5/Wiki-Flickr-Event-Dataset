The current bailout expires on Tuesday, the same day Greece's IMF debt is due.
In a televised address, Mr Tsipras described the bailout plan as "humiliation" and condemned "unbearable" austerity measures demanded by creditors.
But Mr Tsipras will argue that he had no other option.
Some opposition figures on the other hand accused Mr Tsipras of using the vote to push Greece out of the EU.
After winning elections in January, Mr Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party promised to end tough austerity measures.
