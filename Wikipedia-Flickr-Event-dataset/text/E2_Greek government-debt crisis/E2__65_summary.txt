Greece's government is under intense pressure to deliver unpalatable concessions to international creditors to break a four-month debt deadlock and save the country from looming default that could tip it out of the euro zone.
A default might also open the way for Greece to leave the euro zone - though analysts say it could theoretically continue in the bloc even after defaulting.
None of the creditors wants Greece to become the first country to leave the euro zone, even if the risks of contagion - with the crisis spreading to other weaker euro zone countries - are seen as less severe than in previous years.
That could pave the way for a third bailout package of up to 50 billion euros, on top of two since 2010 that total 240 billion euros, though officials say there is not enough time to agree one before the current bailout expires at end-June.
Tsipras would be likely to win an election easily, as opinion polls suggest he remains popular and Greeks overwhelmingly want to stay in the euro zone despite the years of grinding austerity imposed on them.
