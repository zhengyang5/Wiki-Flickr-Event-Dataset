Balance of Payments in the European PeripheryThe countries of the European periphery are experiencing a balance of payments crisis stemming from persistent current account deficits and sharply lower private capital inflows, a condition known as a sudden stop.
Third, because a country running a current account deficit consumes more than it produces, it is forced to borrow.
For current account deficits to persist, more money must come into the country through financial transactions than leaves.
This heavy borrowing further aggravates the factors that cause current account deficits in the first place.
