Euro zone governments threw Greece another 11th-hour credit lifeline on Thursday worth $9.5-billion and sketched new detail on possible debt relief as the IMF finally offered to help out after two years of hesitation.
“There is now light at the end of the tunnel,” Greece’s Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters after meeting fellow euro zone finance ministers and IMF chief Christine Lagarde in Luxembourg.
A proposal by the French government under new President Emmanuel Macron to help bridge differences on debt relief will underpin further euro zone discussions, officials said.
Euro zone bailout fund chief Klaus Regling said his European Stability Mechanism would disburse €7.7-billion in early July to cover €6.9-billion in maturing debt and 0.8 billion of arrears.
But they did not go any further than that and the IMF said it was not enough to calculate Greek debt sustainability.
