According to Apostolos Veizis, the head of programmes for MSF Greece, this is the new reality that the country is waking up to.
“Normally from the data sent to the [World Health Organisation], we basically have an idea of where we need to go.
MSF Greece is currently performing an assessment of the situation in Athens to get to grips with the full extent of what is happening.
Are NGOs willing to stick it out providing healthcare where Western governments cannot for perhaps years to come?
Things will certainly get worse next year.”“There is a deepening humanitarian crisis in Greece, but nobody wants to see this.”
