“Corruption in Greece is alive and well,” said Aliki Mouriki, a sociologist at the National Centre for Social Research.
According to Costas Bakouris, who heads the watchdog’s Greek chapter, the debt-stricken country remains entrenched in a crisis of values.
“There are two wars that Greece has to win and the first is to become a society that respects law and order,” he told the Guardian.
Since the crisis erupted in late 2009, the public health, welfare and education systems have been devastated by cuts.
“The optimism that the crisis would clean Greek politics was always fanciful because in a crisis people struggle to get any economic security by any means.” In Greece, the very structure of the economy also facilitates corruption.
