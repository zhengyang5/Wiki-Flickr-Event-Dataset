In return, Europe signalled a winding back of austerity measures for the struggling nation, in a move that could end a dispute between EU creditors and the International Monetary Fund over how to deal with Greece.
But the announcement sparked anger in Greece, where the main opposition party accused the government of caving in while the economy was weak.
“The government is celebrating the return of the institutions to Greece while the economy is sinking,” said the centre-right New Democracy group.
Greece faces a €7.4bn debt repayment bill in July, making the summer an unofficial deadline for an deal on unlocking the second instalment of the current bailout, the country’s third.
The latest eurozone meeting had been seen as the last chance to sort out Greek reforms before Europe enters a critical electoral cycle, starting with Dutch elections on 15 March.
