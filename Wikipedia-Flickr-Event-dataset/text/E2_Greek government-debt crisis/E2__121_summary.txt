James Stewart standing in the cashier cubicle in a bank run scene from the 1946 film “It’s a Wonderful Life”.
Monday’s Making Sen$e post asked you a question: Would you keep your euro in a Greek bank if you thought a “Grexit” — a Greek exit from the euro — was inevitable?
And if you wouldn’t, would a run on Greek banks not be forthcoming.
Not in the Northern Rock/IndyMac/”It’s-a-Wonderful-Life” sense of a bank run, at least, with depositors lining up, panic stricken, to withdraw their money.
Greeks pull their money out of Greek banks and deposit the digits in Swiss or German banks.
