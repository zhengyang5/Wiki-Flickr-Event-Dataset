Greeks started using credit and debit cards during the financial crisis since capital controls were placed on the amount of cash allowed to be taken out of bank accounts.
So when Greece limited the amount of withdrawals last summer to avoid financial catastrophe, she got her first debit card.
Math student Tassos Tassoulas uses his debit card for the opposite reason.
“But most people ask if there is an ATM before they use their debit card,” she says.
For debit cards specifically, the increase was 265 percent.
