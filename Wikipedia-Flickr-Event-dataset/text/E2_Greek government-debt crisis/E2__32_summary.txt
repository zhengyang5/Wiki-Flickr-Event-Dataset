Tax inspectors are continuing a "safari" around Greece's prime tourist destinations at the end of August, with several indicative examples of alleged tax evasion and VAT avoidance released to the press.
One well-known taverna on Paros island was cited for failing to issue 36 receipts worth 6.500 euros.
Another even more egregious example came on jet-setting Mykonos, where an upscale restaurant was cited for failing to issue 65 receipts valued at 24,000 euros.
It's noteworthy that tax inspectors monitored the aforementioned establishments for only a few days, or even a day, according to media reports.
