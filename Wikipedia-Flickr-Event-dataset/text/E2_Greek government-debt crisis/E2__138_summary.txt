On Saturday The Times reported on an apparently growing phenomenon in Europe : “suicide by economic crisis,” people taking their own lives in despair over unemployment and business failure.
But I’m sure I wasn’t the only reader, especially among economists, wondering if the larger story isn’t so much about individuals as about the apparent determination of European leaders to commit economic suicide for the Continent as a whole.
And it’s getting harder and harder to believe that anything will get them to change course.
Never mind talk of recession; Spain is in full-on depression , with the overall unemployment rate at 23.6 percent, comparable to America at the depths of the Great Depression , and the youth unemployment rate over 50 percent.
This can’t go on — and the realization that it can’t go on is what is sending Spanish borrowing costs ever higher.
