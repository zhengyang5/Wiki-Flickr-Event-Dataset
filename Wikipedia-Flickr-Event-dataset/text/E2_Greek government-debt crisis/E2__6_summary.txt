Greek PM Alexis Tsipras had requested a short extension to Greece's current bailout, and a two-year rescue deal.
If it fails to repay the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Greece could risk leaving the euro.
Athens couldn't possibly repay and in any event they want to keep talking, hoping they can keep Greece in the eurozone.
EU leaders have warned that a no vote rejecting creditors' proposals would mean Greece leaving the eurozone - though Mr Tsipras says he does not want this to happen.
5 July - the referendum on creditors' proposals, and many say Greece's membership of the eurozone, takes place20 July - Greece must redeem â‚¬3.46bn of bonds held by the European Central Bank.
