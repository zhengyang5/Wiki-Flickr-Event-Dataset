Precedent suggests they’ll probably get just over half that, putting the average negotiated raise for 2012 above both last year’s 1.5 percent gain and an expected euro zone inflation rate of some 1.7 percent.

“Wage restraint is not coming to an end - pay this year is just catching up,” said Commerzbank economist Eckart Tuchtfeld, who forecasts negotiated wages to rise 2.75 percent in 2012.

They point to low German pay growth as a factor behind subdued demand for their own goods.
