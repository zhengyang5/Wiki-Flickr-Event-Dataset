The Greek DepressionWhen European finance ministers approved another $64 billion in aid to Greece in December, Europhiles breathed a collective sigh of relief.
2013 will mark the sixth year of Greece’s "Great Depression," during which the country has lost more than a quarter of its GDP.
Current estimates put the annual cost of red tape in the Greek bureaucracy at 6.8 percent of GDP.
The Greek experiment is far from over, and, indeed, the country’s fraught political environment might well throw a wrench in the current recovery effort.
Ultimately, however, Greece’s economic future turns on striking a delicate balance between social unity, political wherewithal, and mindful external support.
