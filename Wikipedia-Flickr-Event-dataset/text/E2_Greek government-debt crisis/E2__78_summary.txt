Europe and the IMF have been unable to reconcile two views of Greece’s debt sustainability, with the two sides’ differences spilling over into the public domain.
For the IMF, meaningful debt reduction is critical for generating the confidence and credibility needed to break Greece out of a prolonged period of impoverishment.
Offering debt relief, it is feared, could undermine the credibility of governing parties and provide a boost to extremist movements.
Meanwhile, growth is languishing once again, despite the pickup in European economic performance as a whole.
But the IMF refrains from actually disbursing its own loans, pending a more satisfactory outcome on overall financing assurances (in this case, proper debt relief for Greece).
