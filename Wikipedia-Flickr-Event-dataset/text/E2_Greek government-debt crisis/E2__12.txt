Creating a Trustworthy Market

Foreign capital inflows in Greece grew by 40.5%, (€6.48 billion) with net inflows soaring by 147.8% (€3.47 billion), in 2008, compared with the previous year, Invest in Greece Agency – the Hellenic investment promotion body – announced yesterday. Citing figures on Foreign Direct Investments in Greece, published by the Bank of Greece, the Agency said this positive development – amidst an unprecedented international financial crisis – was evidence of foreign investors’ trust towards the Greek market (mainly from the EU and US).

I.T. Is “The Key”

Meeting with Israeli and British businesspeople, Invest in Greece Agency presented Greece’s comparative advantages in the field of advanced technologies such as Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) systems. Both in Israel and United Kingdom, the agency provided information on the advantages deriving from a possible expansion of major technology companies’ business activities in Greece. The Greek ICT sector offers highly skilled human capital and geographic proximity to the markets of Southeast Europe and East Mediterranean , elements which can accommodate the growing need for alternative R&D investment locations around the globe, given the fact the ICT sector still offers considerable room for growth, profit margins and projects of high added value.
