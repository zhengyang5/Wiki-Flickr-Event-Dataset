Brussels - No one was more surprised about Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras calling a referendum than his team of negotiators in Brussels.
It was the first Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s Brussels negotiators had heard about it.
Commission negotiators called their president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who had spent recent weeks in face-to-face talks with Tsipras.
Greek Finance Yanis Varoufakis was interviewed by local television at about 8:30 p.m. in Athens, sounding an optimistic note about a deal.
He announced the referendum for July 5 and advocated a “no” vote, describing the last proposal made by creditors as a violation of EU rules.
