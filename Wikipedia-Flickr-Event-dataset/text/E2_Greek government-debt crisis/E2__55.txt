Greece must speed up its 50 billion-euro ($71 billion) plan to sell state assets and develop real estate and attract investments to get its economy back on the right track, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said.

“To be able to start up the Greek economy’s big engine so it produces what we all want -- jobs, investment and wealth for Greeks -- we must proceed faster and more decisively,” Papaconstantinou told lawmakers in Athens today in comments broadcast live on state-run Vouli TV. “The state property and real-estate development and state-asset sales plans move in this direction.”

Greece is aiming to raise the 50 billion euros by 2015 to help reduce its debt, which is expected to peak at 166 percent of gross domestic product next year, according to European Commission estimates released on May 13.

“The time has come to speed up more,” Papaconstantinou said. The sale of stakes in listed companies must be the priority, followed by the formation of management bodies for a “faster income inflow from real-estate holdings.”

The government announced this week it hired banks to advise on the plans. It said on April 15 it will sell a stake in Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA, reduce its holding in Public Power Corp. SA to 34 percent from 51 percent and sell its stake in Opap SA, Europe’s biggest listed gambling company.

EU Warning

European Union finance ministers told Papaconstantinou at a meeting in Brussels this week that Greece must reinforce its plans and sell assets faster to regain control of the national debt. Papaconstantinou said today that the debt is sustainable with the right management.

Papaconstantinou said fiscal adjustment is not enough to revive economic growth. The economy shrank 4.5 percent last year and is forecast to contract 3.5 percent this year, according to the commission.

Prime Minister George Papandreou has implemented austerity measures including wage and pension cuts and higher sales taxes in exchange for a 110 billion-euro bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund that was agreed on last May.

“The Greek economy needs private capital, it needs investments. We must attract foreign investment, big foreign companies to invest in Greece, big and small Greek companies. We need to open up the country’s economy to create wealth,” Papaconstantinou said.
