The government had planned to take out €6.5bn (£5bn) in net new debt last year but ended up not needing to take any, and even managed to pay off old debts worth 2.5 billion euros.
Tax revenues climbed to €270.8bn last year - about €2.6bn higher than forecast, according to preliminary 2014 budget figures provided by the ministry.
The government received another 24.7 billion euros from other revenue including dividends and coin sales.
Spending was 1 billion euros less than planned at 295.5 billion euros, its lowest level since 2009.
A second senior government official said the government had spent 1.7 billion euros less on interest payments than forecast.
