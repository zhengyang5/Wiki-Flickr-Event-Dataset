Mohamed El-Erian, the head of PIMCO, the world's biggest bond fund, said on April 12th that his firm was steering clear of new Greek bonds.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) provides figures for foreign banks' lending to the Greek government, Greek banks and the private sector combined.
If Greek bonds are good enough for collateral at the ECB, they ought to be good enough for private investors, too, whatever the (mostly American) rating agencies say.
Sovereign-debt lawyers say that in some ways a restructuring of Greek debt would be easier than many people think.
