For the first time since the financial crisis in 2008, GDP is expected to grow in every country in the European Union. But the pace of the economic recovery remains slow and Europe is still struggling to put the legacies of the crisis behind it and to fully address long-standing structural weaknesses. Weak investment has also prevented a broader and more robust acceleration of domestic demand. Lower oil prices, the depreciation of the euro, quantitative easing by the ECB and the EU Investment Plan, however, should provide the economies of the EU with a temporary boost in 2015 and 2016.
