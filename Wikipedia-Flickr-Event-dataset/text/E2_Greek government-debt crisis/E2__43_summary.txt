European parliament calls for investigation of Goldman Sachs and other investment banks that had contracts with GreeceThe European parliament has urged EU authorities to investigate the role of Goldman Sachs and other investment banks in contracts that helped inflate Greece's public debt.
Over the past few years, Goldman Sachs and other banks lent money to Greece through currency contracts that allowed the government to raise millions but that didn't count as debt.
The transactions led to hefty fees for the investment banks.
McCarthy urged the EU's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, to explain the banks' role and to specify what action he plans to take "to stop banks assisting European governments in hiding public debt".
Greece's public debt is forecast to reach 125% of gross domestic product this year.
