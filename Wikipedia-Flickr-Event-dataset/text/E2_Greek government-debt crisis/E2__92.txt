How exposed are the world's big banks to the Greece Debt crisis?

The crisis is tying up many of Europe's leaders in constant negotiations to agree a bailout deal.

Investment bank researchers at UBS have looked at which banks are the most exposed to the crisis.

The banks with the highest exposure to Greek's problems are not necessarily those with the most invested - the UBS figures also compare the banks' exposure to Greek debt to their total equity, to illustrate whether they have sufficiently strong reserves to handle a Greek debt default.

So, which banks are worst hit?

After the Greek banks, the hardest hit would be those from France and the 11 German banks with stakes in the country.

There is also some €2.3bn invested by British banks too.

The full data is below. What can you do with it?
