The news that Goldman and other banks got paid hundreds of millions of dollars to help Greece hide its huge debts from the EU overseers has now gone mainstream.
Louise Story, Landon Thomas, and Nelson Schwartz at the NYT:In 2001, just after Greece was admitted to Europeâ€™s monetary union, Goldman helped the government quietly borrow billions, people familiar with the transaction said.
Greece, for example, traded away the rights to airport fees and lottery proceeds in years to come.
[Greece paid Goldman] about $300 million in fees for arranging the 2001 transaction, according to several bankers familiar with the deal.
In other words, Greece was just like many American homeowners, who hit their home-equity ATMs every year to remodel their kitchens and buy SUVs they couldn't afford.
