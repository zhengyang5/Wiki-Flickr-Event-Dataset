Greece must speed up its 50 billion-euro ($71 billion) plan to sell state assets and develop real estate and attract investments to get its economy back on the right track, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said.
EU WarningEuropean Union finance ministers told Papaconstantinou at a meeting in Brussels this week that Greece must reinforce its plans and sell assets faster to regain control of the national debt.
The economy shrank 4.5 percent last year and is forecast to contract 3.5 percent this year, according to the commission.
â€œThe Greek economy needs private capital, it needs investments.
We must attract foreign investment, big foreign companies to invest in Greece, big and small Greek companies.
