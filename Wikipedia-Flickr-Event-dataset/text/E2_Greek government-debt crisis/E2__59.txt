The International Monetary Fund said Monday it was suspending financial aid to Greece under its huge rescue program until a new government is formed after elections slated for late January.

"Discussions with the Greek authorities on the completion of the sixth review of the program... will resume once a new government is in place, in consultation with the European Commission and the European Central Bank,Â» IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said.
