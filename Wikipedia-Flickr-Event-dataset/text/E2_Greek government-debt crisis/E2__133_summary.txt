Thanks partly to lax regulation, German banks built up precarious exposures to Europe’s peripheral countries in the years before the crisis.
This mechanism, designed to keep the currency area’s accounts in balance, made it easier for the German banks to exit their positions.
It’s hard to quantify exactly how much Germany has benefited from its European bailout.
One indicator would be the amount German banks pulled out of other euro-area countries since the crisis began.
To prevent such an outcome, with or without Greece, Germany will have to do everything it has so far refused, and more.
