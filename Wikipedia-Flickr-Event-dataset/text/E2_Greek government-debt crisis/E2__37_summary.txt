Stock markets around the world plunged today after Standard & Poor's cut Greece's credit rating to junk status and downgraded its view of Portugal in the clearest evidence yet that the European sovereign debt crisis is spreading.
Analysts blamed politicians in Germany for dragging their feet over a Greek rescue package worth €45bn.
The Greek finance ministry said the downgrade of Greek bonds did not reflect the country's true economic state.
"The downgrade does not reflect the true fundamentals of the Greek economy or the progress on the fiscal front," it said.
Erik Nielsen of Goldman Sachs said today that rescuing the Greek economy could require €150bn over the next three years.
