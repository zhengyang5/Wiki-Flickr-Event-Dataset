AbstractThe Greek debt restructuring of 2012 stands out in the history of sovereign defaults.
Although it provides context, it focuses on the Greek debt restructuring rather than giving a fuller account of the Greek or European debt crisis.
We then turn to the main act of the Greek restructuring: the Marchâ€“April 2012 debt exchange, which is the main focus of this paper.
We conclude with an assessment of the Greek restructuring and its implications for ongoing and future debt crises in Europe.
Will the restructuring make future debt restructuring in Europe easier or more difficult?
