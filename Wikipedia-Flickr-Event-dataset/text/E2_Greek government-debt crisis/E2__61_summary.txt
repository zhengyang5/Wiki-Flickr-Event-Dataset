Greece’s creditors said a deal to unlock rescue aid isn’t imminent as they demanded the debt-ravaged nation make stronger commitments to overhaul its economy.
There is a “substantial way to go,” European economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici said in a Bloomberg television interview on Friday.
Greece and its international creditors remain far apart, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.
Officials there have said an agreement with the IMF and the country’s European creditors could be hammered out by the end of the week.
Under IMF policy, Greece can bundle the four payments due next month and make them all together on June 19.
