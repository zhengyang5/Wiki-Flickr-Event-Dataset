“The crisis gives us the opportunity and this agreement gives us time,” Papandreou said on television late yesterday after he and fellow government chiefs forced investors to accept 50 percent writedowns on Greek debt.
The 130 billion euros in public funding plus the 50 percent writedown on Greek debt follows a fully taxpayer-funded package of 110 billion euros in May 2010.
New Democracy party leader Antonis Samaras, who leads Papandreou in opinion polls, said yesterday the new aid proved the failure of the government’s policies.
If Greece fails to generate “meaningful growth” over the second half of the decade “further debt restructuring may be necessary”.
The new program includes more than the 109 billion euros in official aid envisioned in July.
