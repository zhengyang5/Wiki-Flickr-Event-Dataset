LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The premium investors demand to buy Greek, Portuguese and Irish government debt rather than German benchmarks rose on Tuesday after euro zone states urged Greece to announce more deficit-control steps by mid-March if needed.
The equivalent Portuguese PT10YT=RR spread widened 21 bps on the day to 143 bps, while the Irish equivalent spread over euro zone benchmark Bunds widened by 8 bps to 153 bps ahead of the results of auctions of 2014 and 2020 debt.
Both spreads were at their widest since Feb. 10.
Ten-year Italian BTPs edged three bps wider to 88 bps, also their largest gap since Feb. 10.
Euro zone states urged Greece on Monday to take further steps to control its budget but did not elaborate on last weekâ€™s pledge to defend the country if market pressures spin out of control.
