Speculation is rife that international aid was dependent on Greece following through on agreements to buy military hardware from Germany and France.
"Germany became Germany partly because for 62 years it did not have to think about military expenditure," said Angelos Philippides, a prominent economist.
"It's vital that if the European Union wants to speak about fair deals it should at least guarantee Greek borders [with Turkey] so the country can bring down military spending to 2.2%."
Thanos Dokos, a leading Greek defence expert, says rational debate on such military extravagance has been made impossible by the supposed Turkish threat and a fear among politicians of being labelled unpatriotic.
He said there was an element of hypocrisy in the criticism being levelled at Greece in France and Germany.
