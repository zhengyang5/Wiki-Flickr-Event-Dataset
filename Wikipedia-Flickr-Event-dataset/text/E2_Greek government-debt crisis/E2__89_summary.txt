The Bank of Greece has decided to maintain a precautionary capital reserve of 2 billion euros from the unused resources set aside for the recapitalization of the Greek credit system at the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF).
BoG, together with the HFSF administration, decided to put this amount aside so that the HFSF could retain the capacity to support the credit sector if this becomes necessary.
Therefore, out of the 11.3 billion euros that the HFSF currently has as unused capital stock, only 9.3 billion euros will be released to be used for other purposes, such as reducing the state debt.
If conditions revert to normal and the countryâ€™s return to the road of recovery is confirmed, then the HFSF could retrieve most of the 25 billion euros it placed in the four major lenders.
If the 2 billion euros set aside is not used, it will be added to the collections from the holdings in the systemic lenders, while another 3 billion euros will come from the liquidation of problematic lenders.
