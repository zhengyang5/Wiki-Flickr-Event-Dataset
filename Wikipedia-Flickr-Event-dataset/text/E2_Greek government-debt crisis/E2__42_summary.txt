Greece’s secret loan from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was a costly mistake from the start.
Eurostat said Greece didn’t report the Goldman Sachs transactions in 2008 when the agency told countries to restate their accounts.
“It is possible that Goldman Sachs asked us for general clarifications,” Eurostat said, declining to elaborate.
Loudiadis, now CEO of Rothesay Life, a Goldman Sachs unit that insures longevity risk for U.K. corporate pension plans, declined to comment, a company spokeswoman said.
Loudiadis and a team of Goldman Sachs advisers returned to Athens in August 2005, according to former Greek officials.
