Abstract

The Greek debt restructuring of 2012 stands out in the history of sovereign defaults. It achieved very large debt relief – over 50% of 2012 GDP – with minimal financial disruption, using a combination of new legal techniques, exceptionally large cash incentives, and official sector pressure on key creditors. But it did so at a cost. The timing and design of the restructuring left money on the table from the perspective of Greece, created a large risk for European taxpayers, and set precedents – particularly in its very generous treatment of holdout creditors – that are likely to make future debt restructurings in Europe more difficult. — Jeromin Zettelmeyer, Christoph Trebesch and Mitu Gulati

1. Introduction

This paper studies a central episode of the European debt crisis: the restructuring and near-elimination of Greece's sovereign bonds held by private investors, comprising a face value of more than 100% of Greek GDP. After a €200 billion debt exchange in March/April 2012 and a buyback of a large portion of the newly exchanged sovereign bonds in December, the amount of Greek bonds in the hands of private creditors was down to just €35 billion – just 13% of where it had stood in April 2010, when Greece lost access to capital markets.

The Greek debt exchange can claim historic significance in more than one respect. It set a new world record in terms of restructured debt volume and aggregate creditor losses, easily surpassing previous high-water marks such as the default and restructuring of Argentina in 2001–2005. It was the first major debt restructuring in Europe since the defaults preceding World War II1 – defying statements by European policymakers, issued only months earlier, who had claimed that sovereign defaults were unthinkable for EU countries. It also was a watershed event in the history of the European crisis, plausibly contributing both to its expansion in the summer of 2011 and to its eventual resolution (as we will argue in this paper). Finally, it occupies a special place in the history of sovereign debt crises – along with the Brady deals, for example, and with the 2000 Ecuador restructuring – by introducing a set of legal innovations which helped to engineer an orderly debt exchange, overcoming the collective action problem facing Greek and EU policymakers as they sought to restructure a large amount of debt dispersed among many private creditors.2

The present paper gives an account of the background, mechanics, and outcomes of the Greek debt restructuring. Beyond the basic historical narrative, we focus on three sets of questions.

First, what were the distributional implications of the restructuring – both the main exchange, and the end-2012 debt buyback? We answer this question by computing the impact of the restructuring on the present value of expected cash flows both in the aggregate and bond-by-bond. The results confirm that the exchange resulted in a vast transfer from private creditors to Greece, in the order of €100 billion in present value terms; corresponding to 50% of 2012 GDP (this is net of the costs of recapitalizing Greek banks to offset losses incurred through the restructuring). But we also show that the ‘haircuts’ suffered by creditors on average were considerably lower than the 75% widely reported in the financial press at the time of the debt exchange, namely, in the order of 59–65%, depending on which methodology is applied. Furthermore, these losses were not equally distributed across creditors, with much higher present value losses on bonds maturing within a year (75% or more), and much lower losses on bonds maturing after 2025 (less than 50%). Finally, we show that notwithstanding a significant rise in bond market prices in anticipation of the December 2012 buy back, the operation did result in some debt relief for Greece, although this was small both due to the voluntary approach that was chosen and the small scale of the operation.

Second, how was the free rider problem addressed, that is, the incentive of each creditor not to participate while hoping that all other bondholders accept? Part of the answer is that a large share of Greek bonds were held by banks and other institutional investors which were susceptible to pressure by their regulators, peer pressure via a creditor committee resembling the ‘London Club’ committees of the 1980s, or both. However, these institutions accounted for no more than 60% of outstanding principal, while the final participation rate was 97%. To bail in the remaining creditors, Greece relied on a mix of carrots and sticks embedded in the exchange offer itself. The main stick was a change in domestic law which made the offer compulsory for all holders of local-law bonds subject to approval by creditors holding two-thirds of outstanding principal. The main carrot was an unusually high cash pay-out: creditors received more than 15% of the value of their old bonds in cash-like short-term European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) bonds. A further carrot consisted of legal and contractual terms that gave the new bonds a better chance of surviving future Greek debt crises than the old ones. Ironically, these ‘carrots’ may have turned out to be particularly appealing because market commentary thought it unlikely that Greece's proposed debt restructuring, even if it succeeded, would be the last one. In this situation, many potential holdouts opted for the bird in hand rather than the two in the bush.

Third, we assess the restructuring and its implications for the management of future European debt crises. Was the restructuring necessary and could it have been handled better? Does it provide a template for any future European sovereign debt restructuring? The flavour of our answers is mixed. On the one hand, the restructuring was both unavoidable and successful in achieving deep debt relief relatively swiftly and in an orderly manner – no small feat. On the other hand, its timing, execution and design left money on the table from the perspective of Greece, created a large risk for European taxpayers, and set precedents – particularly in its very generous treatment of holdouts – that are likely to make future debt restructurings in Europe more difficult. Partly as a result, it will be hard to repeat a Greek-style restructuring elsewhere in Europe should the need arise. This calls for a more systematic approach to future debt restructurings, which could be achieved through an ESM treaty change.

The paper has important limitations. It is essentially a case study. Although it provides context, it focuses on the Greek debt restructuring rather than giving a fuller account of the Greek or European debt crisis. In particular, it analyses neither the causes of the crisis nor its management except as relates to the restructuring. And while it touches on some of the big questions surrounding sovereign debt crises – including when countries should restructure their debts and how debt restructurings can be efficiently managed – we need to refer the reader to the broader literature for complete answers.3

The paper is for the most part organized chronologically. In the section that follows, we describe the background to the 2012 restructuring: the May 2010 EU/IMF programme with Greece, and the July 2011 decision to restructure in principle (euphemistically referred to as ‘private sector involvement’, or PSI). We also briefly analyse the implications of the restructuring proposal agreed by Greece and the Institute of International Finance (IIF) at that time. We then turn to the main act of the Greek restructuring: the March–April 2012 debt exchange, which is the main focus of this paper. Next, we analyse the last act (for now), the December 2012 bond buyback. We conclude with an assessment of the Greek restructuring and its implications for ongoing and future debt crises in Europe.

2. From the 2010 Bailout to the July 2011 PSI Proposal

The Greek debt crisis began in October 2009, when the newly elected government of George Papandreou revealed that the country had understated its debt and deficit figures for years. The projected budget deficit for 2009, in particular, was revised upwards from an estimated 7% to more than 12% (it eventually ended up at 15.6%). This set the stage for months of further bad economic news, which eroded market confidence in Greece and its debt sustainability and resulted in a number of rating downgrades, first by Fitch, then by S&P and Moody's. As the situation continued to deteriorate, Greek sovereign bond yields continued to rise, until spreads over German bunds shot up from 300 to almost 900 basis points during April, effectively excluding Greece from access to bond markets. Faced with an imminent rollover crisis, the Greek government had no choice but to turn to eurozone governments and the IMF.

Despite initial German resistance, a three-year rescue package was agreed on 2 May 2010. It amounted to €80 billion in EU loans and a further €30 billion of IMF credit, and was to be paid out in tranches until 2012, conditional on the implementation of a fiscal adjustment package of 11 percentage points of GDP over three years, and structural reforms meant to restore competitiveness and growth. One week later, eurozone leaders agreed on further rescue measures, particularly the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) with a lending capacity of €440 billion for troubled sovereigns, and the ECB's ‘secondary market purchase programme’ (SMP) to stabilize sovereign bond yields in secondary markets. Initially, markets rallied, spreads fell sharply. However, market scepticism soon returned, particularly after Moody's downgraded Greece in mid-June, citing substantial macroeconomic and implementation risks associated with the Eurozone/IMF support package (Global Credit Research, 2010). By July, spreads again began to exceed 800 basis points.

In October of 2010, the debt crisis in Europe reached a watershed at the trilateral Franco-German-Russian Summit in Deauville, when the President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel called for a permanent crisis resolution mechanism in Europe ‘comprising the necessary arrangements for an adequate participation of the private sector’. Although it referred not to the handling of the ongoing European crisis but to a European crisis resolution framework that was to replace the EFSF in 2013, the ‘Deauville statement’ was widely interpreted as an official signal that sovereign debt restructuring would henceforth be acceptable in EU countries. The result was a sharp widening of the bond spreads of peripheral European countries. In this setting, the prospects of a quick return of Greece to international capital markets by early 2012 – as envisaged in the May programme – looked increasingly unlikely.

Notwithstanding market scepticism, Greece's programme achieved significant fiscal consolidation during 2010 (about 5% of GDP). In light of a deepening recession and growing domestic opposition to the programme, however, fiscal adjustment became stuck in the first half of 2011, at a time when the overall and primary deficit were still in the order of 10 and 5 percentage points, respectively, sovereign debt stood at over 140% of GDP, and output was expected to continue to decline at a rate of 3–4% for the next two years. Most worryingly, structural reforms that were supposed to restore growth in the medium term were delayed, and reform implementation was weak. An IMF review ending on 2 June 2011 and published in mid-July hence concluded that Greece's outlook ‘does not allow the staff to deem debt to be sustainable with high probability', and all but ruled out a return to capital markets until the end of the programme period in mid-2013. Unless the official sector was prepared to offer additional financing in the order of €70–104 billion (depending on the timing of the assumed return to capital markets), some form of ‘private sector involvement’ (PSI) was unavoidable, even if one took a benign view of Greece's debt sustainability (IMF, 2011).

On 6 June 2011, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble wrote a letter to the ECB and IMF proposing ‘to initiate the process of involving holders of Greek bonds … through a bond swap leading to a prolongation of the outstanding Greek sovereign bonds by seven years’.4 Shortly afterwards, a group of major French banks issued the first detailed proposal on how a Greek bond rescheduling might look like (Kopf, 2011). The French proposal already contained many of the elements that would ultimately be part of the March 2012 exchange, namely a large upfront cash payment, a 30-year lengthening of maturities, and a new GDP-linked security as sweetener. Importantly, however, it only targeted bonds maturing in 2011–14, and it did not foresee any nominal debt reduction (face value haircut). From the perspective of the German government, this proposal was not sufficient, and talks about the form of PSI went on until the EU summit on 21 July 2011 (Wiesmann et al., 2011).

Immediately after the summit, eurozone heads of government and the IIF – representing major banks and other institutional investors holding Greek bonds – each issued statements that together amounted to a new financing proposal for Greece, consisting of an official sector commitment and a private sector ‘offer’:

First, the official sector (EU and IMF together) promised financing in the amount of €109 billion. Since only about €65 billion of the original €110 billion May 2010 package had been disbursed up to that point, this amounted to additional official financing of €64 billion over and above the original commitment. The EU portion of the new financing was to be delivered through EFSF loans with longer maturities – between 15 and 30 years – and lower interest rates than the loans disbursed so far. A maturity extension for the bilateral EU loans that had already been disbursed was also promised.

Second, 39 financial institutions (both international and Greek) expressed their willingness ‘to participate in a voluntary program of debt exchange’. Creditors would have a choice between four options: a 30-year ‘par bond’ with no face value reduction paying slightly lower coupons than typical for Greece's debt stock (namely, 4% in the first 5 years, 4.5% in the next five years, and 5% thereafter); a 30-year ‘discount bond’ with a 20% face value reduction but slightly higher coupon rates (6%, 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively); and a 15-year discount bond with a 20% face value reduction and 5.9% coupon. The fourth option was to receive the par bond not immediately but in lieu of cash repayment at the time of maturity of the bond held by the creditor. Importantly, following a structure popularized in the Brady deals of the early 1990s, the principal of the 30-year bonds was to be fully collateralized using zero coupon bonds purchased by Greece from the EFSF and held in an escrow account. For the 15-year bond, the collateral would cover collateralization up to 80% of any loss on principal, up to a maximum of 40% of new principal.

Assuming a 90% participation rate among privately held bonds maturing between August 2011 and July 2020 (the bonds to be targeted in the exchange, as subsequently clarified by the Greek Ministry of Finance), this amounted to private financing of about €135 billion in total, about €54 billion of which corresponded to the period between mid-2011 and mid-2014.5 Hence, under the July 2011 proposal, the official and private sector together would have lent Greece an extra €118 billion at low interest rates between 2011 and 2014. This exceeded the €70 billion financing gap calculated by the IMF in its July report by €38 billion corresponding to the collateral that the official sector was offering to lend to Greece in order to persuade the private sector to chip in its contribution. Hence, an extra €38 billion of official sector lending ‘bought’ €54 billion of private sector financing through 2011–14 but also implied postponing the repayment of most principal falling due between 2014 and 2020, hence giving Greece and its official creditors some leeway in case it remained shut off from capital market after the programme period.

From a financing perspective, the July 2011 proposal hence implied a significant contribution from the private sector. But did it also imply debt relief? The IIF claimed so in its July press release, which stated that the debt exchange implied a 21% net present value (NPV) loss for investors, based on an assumed discount rate of 9% (reflecting a guess as to what the yield of the new bonds might be following a successful exchange). However, there are several reasons to be sceptical of this claim.

First, the IIF's was referring to the fact that the value of the new instruments, applying a 9% discount rate on the risky portion of their cash flows (together with a lower interest rate on the collateralized portion) amounted to 79 cents per euro of old principal. Hence, investors opting for the new bonds would have suffered a loss of 21 cents on the euro compared to the alternative of receiving full and immediate repayment of their old bonds. This approach to computing creditor losses reflects widespread market convention, and makes sense in some settings (when either the outstanding bonds are of very short maturity; or when bonds are ‘accelerated’, i.e. become due and payable immediately), but not when creditors own bonds of longer maturity and do not have the right to immediate full repayment. In such a situation, the value of the new bonds should be compared not to 100 but rather a present value of the payment stream promised by the old bonds, evaluated at the same discount rate as the new bonds (see next section and Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2008, for details). Using the IIF's 9% discount rate, this implies much smaller creditor losses, namely, just 11.5% (see Table 1).6

Second, it is not clear that from the perspective of computing Greece's debt relief (as opposed to creditor losses), 9% was in fact the appropriate discount rate. Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2007b) argue that if the country is expected to return to capital markets over the medium term, the discount rate for the purposes of computing debt relief should be somewhere between the country's future expected borrowing rate and the international risk free rate, because the country will be using rates in this interval to transfer revenues across time (saving at the international risk-free rate, or borrowing against future revenues at a market rate).7 One rate which was surely within this interval from the perspective of mid-2011 was the 5% discount rate used by the IMF in its debt sustainability calculations (since ‘risk free’ German bonds yielded around 3–3.5% in July 2011, and on the assumption of a future Greek borrowing spread at least 200 basis points after re-entering capital markets). Using this 5% discount rate to compare old and proposed new debt flows, the debt relief implied by the July 2011 financing offer would have been approximately zero – indeed, slightly negative. Using the ‘risk free’ discount rate of about 3.5% (not shown in the table), would indicate an increase of Greece's debt burden by about 11–15% in July 2011.

In the event, the July 2011 financing offer was never implemented. The deepening recession in Greece and the difficulties of the EU and IMF to agree on a credible package of structural reforms with the Greek government lowered expectations of the growth path that Greece might realistically achieve and exacerbated worries about its debt servicing capacity. These worries were reflected in sharply rising secondary yields, making it much less likely that the largely voluntary debt exchange envisaged in July would succeed – not just in the sense of restoring Greece's solvency over the medium term, but even in the more pedestrian sense of attracting high participation.8 On 9 October 2011, German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, was quoted in Frankfurter Allgemeine as saying ‘the debt reduction we aimed at in July may have been too low’. This view was corroborated by a new IMF analysis prepared for the 26 October Euro summit in Brussels, which concluded that Greece's debt was no longer sustainable except ‘with much stronger PSI’.9

3. The March–April 2012 Bond Exchange

The Euro Summit statement of 26 October 2011 invited ‘Greece, private investors and all parties concerned to develop a voluntary bond exchange with a nominal discount of 50% on notional Greek debt held by private investors’ and pledged to ‘contribute to the PSI package up to 30 billion euro’ as well as additional lending to help with the recapitalization of Greek banks. This set the stage for a new round of PSI negotiations between Greece and a group of creditors led by a steering group of 12 banks, insurers and asset managers on behalf of a larger group of 32 creditors, which together held an estimated 30–40% of Greece's privately held debt (Table 2).

On 21 February 2012, Greece and the steering committee announced in parallel press releases that a deal had been agreed. A formal debt restructuring offer followed three days later. This turned out to look very different from the IIF's July ‘financing offer’. Investors were only offered one take-it-or-leave it package – referred to as the ‘PSI consideration’, not a menu of four alternatives. The promised official contribution was used not to collateralize principal repayments of the new bonds, but rather to finance large upfront cash payments. Most importantly, the new bonds offered for exchange involved both much lower face value and lower coupon rates. Specifically, the ‘PSI consideration’ comprised (see the Web Appendix for details):

One and two year notes issued by the EFSF, amounting to 15% of the old debt's face value; 20 new government bonds maturing between 2023 and 2042, amounting to 31.5% of the old debt's face value, with annual coupons between 2% and 4.3%. These bonds were issued under English law and governed by a ‘co-financing agreement’ with the EFSF which instituted a sharing provision for the private bondholders vis-à-vis the EFSF (see below); A GDP-linked security which could provide an extra payment stream of up to one percentage point of the face value of the outstanding new bonds if GDP exceeded a specified target path (roughly in line with the IMF's medium- and long-term growth projections for Greece). Compensation for any accrued interest still owed by the old bonds, in the form of 6-month EFSF notes.

Another important difference with respect to the July proposal was that the offer cast a much wider net. Whereas the July plan had envisaged exchanging only sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed railway bonds with less than 9 years of remaining maturity, the February 2012 offer was directed at all privately held sovereign bonds issued prior to 2012, with total face value of €195.7 billion, as well as 36 sovereign-guaranteed bonds issued by public enterprises (not just Hellenic Railways, but also of the Hellenic Defence Systems, and of Athens Public Transport). As a result, the total volume targeted in the February offer exceeded that of the July proposal by about €50 billion, in spite of the fact that Greece's bonded debt stock had shrunk by €10 billion in the meantime, as investors continued to be repaid in full and on time while negotiations dragged on.

Perhaps the only important sense which the February proposal did not differ from the July plan is that it excluded the bond holdings of the ECB – Greece's single largest bondholder by far, with €42.7 billion (16.3%) of holdings in February 2012 – national Central Banks (€13.5 billion of Greek bonds, about 5% of the total), and the EIB (€315 million). Just ahead of the publication of the offer, these were swapped into a new series with identical payment terms and maturity dates. As part of the February swap arrangement, the ECB committed to return any profits on Greek government bond holdings, most of which had been purchased significantly below par during 2010, to its shareholders. But this did not mean that they would be returned to Greece: the euro group agreed on such a return only in late November 2012.10

With some relatively minor exceptions,11 all bondholders that were offered the ‘PSI consideration’ also received a ‘consent solicitation’, in which they were asked to vote for an amendment of the bonds that permitted Greece to exchange the bonds for the new package of securities. Bondholders accepting the offer were considered to simultaneously have cast a vote in favour of the amendment. However, bondholders that ignored or rejected the exchange offer were deemed to have voted against the amendment only if they submitted a specific instruction to that effect.

The rules for accepting the amendment differed according to their governing law. About €20 billon of sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed bonds – just under 10% of eligible face value – had been issued under English law. For these bonds, the amendment rules were laid out in ‘collective action clauses’ (CACs) contained in the original bond contracts, and voted on bond-by-bond.12 In contrast, the large majority of Greece's sovereign bonds that had been issued under Greek law – €177.3 billion, over 86% of eligible debt – contained no such collective action clauses, meaning that these bonds could only be restructured with the unanimous consent of all bond holders. However, because they were issued under local law, the bond contracts themselves could be changed by passing a domestic law to that effect. In theory, Greece could have used this instrument to simply legislate different payment terms, or give itself the power to exchange the bonds for the new securities, but this might have been viewed as an expropriation of bondholders by legislative fiat, and could have been challenged under the Greek constitution, the European Convention of Human Rights and principles of customary international law.

Instead, the Greek legislature passed a law (Greek Bondholder Act, 4050/12, 23 February 2012) that allowed the restructuring of the Greek law bonds with the consent of a qualified majority, based on a quorum of votes representing 50% of face value and a consent threshold of two-thirds of the face value taking part in the vote.13 Importantly, this quorum and threshold applied across the totality of all Greek law sovereign bonds outstanding, rather than bond-by-bond. While this ‘retrofit CAC’ gave bondholders collectively a say over the restructuring which was roughly analogous to that afforded to English law bondholders, the sheer size of what it would have taken for bondholders to purchase a blocking position made it near impossible for individual bondholders (or coalitions of bondholders) to block the restructuring.

The offer was contingent on Greece obtaining the EFSF notes that were to be delivered to creditors in the exchange (which in turn depended on the completion of some prior actions under Greece's IMF and EU supported programme); and a ‘minimum participation condition’, according to which the proposed exchange and amendments would not go forward if this were to result in a restructuring of less than 75% of face value. Conditions of the type had been used in most debt exchange offers since the mid-1990s to reassure tendering bondholders that they would not be left out in the cold (i.e. holding a smaller, and potentially illiquid claim) in the event that most other bondholders chose not to accept the offer (Bi et al., 2011).

At the same time, Greece and the Troika decided to set a 90% minimum participation threshold as a precondition for unequivocally going forward with the exchange and amendments. This implied, in particular, that if Greece succeeded with its attempt to amend its domestic law sovereign bonds within the framework set out by the 23 February law, the exchange would likely go forward, since the Greek law sovereign bonds alone amounted to about 86% of the total eligible debt. Between the two thresholds Greece would allow itself discretion, ‘in consultation with its official sector creditors’ on whether or not to proceed with the exchange and amendments.

Greece gave its creditors just two weeks, until 8 March, to accept or reject the offer. This tight deadline was needed to complete at least the domestic law component of the exchange before 20 March, when a large Greek law bond issue was coming due for repayment.

3.1. Restructuring outcome

On 9 March, Greece announced that 82.5% of the €177.3 billion in sovereign bonds issued under domestic law had accepted the exchange offer and consent solicitation.14 Participation among the foreign-law bondholders was initially lower, at around 61%. But together, these participation levels implied that both thresholds that were critical for the success of the exchange – first the two-thirds threshold for amending all Greek-law bonds using the 23 February law, and subsequently the overall participation threshold of 90% – could be met by a wide margin. Since EFSF financing had also been made available in the meantime, the government announced that it would proceed with the exchange of the Greek law bonds. At the same time, the participation deadline for foreign law bondholders was extended twice, to early April.

Greece's new bonds started trading immediately, on 12 March, at yields in the range of just under 14 (longer bonds) to about 17.5% (shorter bonds, see Figure 1). Weighted by principal, the average ‘exit yield’ was 15.3% – higher than the sovereign yield of any other eurozone country at the time, and suggesting that even after the success of a very significant debt reduction operation seemed all but assured, private creditors remained sceptical about the future of Greece's programme and its longer-term ability to repay. At the same time, Greece's high exit yields were not unusually high compared to emerging market debt restructurings of the past.15

By the time the last of Greece's exchanged or amended foreign law bonds had settled on 25 April, Greece had achieved total participation of €199.2 billion, or 96.9%, resulting in a pay-out of €29.7 in short-term EFSF notes and €61.44 in new long sovereign bonds. Hence, the face value of Greece's debt declined by €108 billion as the result of the exchange, or 52.5% of the eligible debt.

Holders of €6.4 billion in face value held out. The holdouts were scattered across 25 sovereign or sovereign guaranteed bonds, of which 24 were foreign-law titles (for details see Appendix 2 and Zettelmeyer et al., 2013). The final participation rate among foreign law bondholders was 71%, slightly lower than the 76% achieved by Argentina in 2005. However, because of the large share of domestic law debt and the application of the Greek Bondholder Act to bind in the domestic law bondholders, the share of holdouts in total eligible debt was much smaller, just 3.1%. So far, Greece has repaid the holdouts in full. As of April 2013, five bonds involving holdouts have matured.16

Figure 2 shows how the debt exchange changed the payments expected by creditors. The series denoted ‘before’ the exchange refers to the payment flows promised by Greece's old bonds, both interest and amortization. The series ‘after’, which is decomposed in Figure 3, comprises both payment flows due to old bonds that were not exchanged (bonds in the hands of holdouts, national central banks and the ECB), payment flows promised by the new bonds, and payments flows associated with the short-term EFSF notes (both the 6-month notes that compensated investors for accrued interest, and the 1 and 2 year notes in the amount of 15% of the old face value).17

The main message from Figure 2 is that although the exchange significantly lowered the flows to investors as a whole, they did not significantly shift the payment profile into the future, as the longer maturities of Greece's new bonds (compared to most of the old ones) was offset by a bunching of payments due to the EFSF notes at the short end of the maturity profile. In addition, Greece's debts to non-participating investors – holdouts (€6.4 billion) and the ECB and national central banks (€56.7 billion) – were bunched at the short end (see Figure 3), and continued to exceed Greece's new long-term bonds (€61.44 billion) in face value.

3.1.1. Distributional implications

We now compute the distributional implications of the restructuring, from three angles: First, aggregate investor losses; second, distributional implications across investors, and third, total debt relief received by Greece.18

Investor losses in the aggregate

As already mentioned in the discussion of the July 2011 financing offer, there are several ways to compute the loss, or ‘haircut’, suffered by a representative investor holding sovereign bonds. Market practitioners define haircuts as 100 minus the present value of the new bonds offered. For the reasons explained above, this measure tends to exaggerate creditor losses, as it implies that so long as the value of the new bonds is below par, creditors suffer a haircut – even in an entirely voluntary debt management operation in which the new bonds have higher market value than the old bonds. We therefore take an alternative approach that follows our previous work (Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2008; Cruces and Trebesch, 2013), but also private sector economists such as Ghezzi et al. (2011) and Kopf (2011), namely, to compute present value haircuts as the percentage difference between the present value of the new and old bonds, both evaluated at the exit yield observable immediately after the exchange. This definition has two useful interpretations:

First, it measures the loss suffered by a participating creditor compared to a situation in which he or she had been allowed to keep the old bonds and have them serviced with the same probability as the new bonds that were issued in the exchange. In other words, it compares the value of the old and new bonds in a hypothetical situation in which there would have been no discrimination against the holders of the old bonds.

In actual fact, participating creditors of course chose the new bonds, suggesting that – if the haircut was positive – there must have been discrimination against holdouts in some form. Hence, the present value haircut can equivalently be interpreted as measuring the strength of the incentives that the debtor must have offered to prevent free riding – by threatening to default, or perhaps through other means. This leads to the question of what those incentives were in the case of Greece, and how they compare to previous exchanges. We take this up in the next section.

Although the present value haircut is conceptually simple, computing it in practice is not always straightforward. One problem is that the risk characteristics of the new bonds, and hence the exit yields, can be specific to the maturity of the new bonds (or more generally, the timing of the promised payment stream), which may differ from those of the old bonds. This was the case in Greece, where exit yields are available for bonds of 10-year maturity and up (Figure 1), but it is not clear what rate to use to discount old bonds of shorter maturity. Another problem is that the market on the first day of trading after a debt exchange may not be very liquid (for example, because some institutional investors are not yet in the market pending some rating action). Hence, the exit yield may not be entirely representative for the yield that establishes itself in the market shortly after the exchange, even if there is no new information about fundamentals in the intervening period.

We seek to address these problems by computing alternative aggregate haircut estimates based on three approaches (Table 3).

The first column of Table 3 calculates the value of the old bonds using the average discount rate corresponding to the prices of the new bonds (15.3%). For the purposes of discounting shorter old bonds, this is likely too low.

The second and third columns show the sensitivity of these results to using yields on two alternative dates: 19 March – one week after the first date of trading; which incidentally coincides with the date on which the result of the CDS settlement was announced (16.3%);19 and 25 April, the date on which the final exchange results were announced (18.7%).

Finally, the last column of Table 3 shows the average haircut using a different discount rate for each bond depending on its maturity. For this purpose, we construct a yield curve which is based on observed data at the longer end (for maturities 10 years and up, based on the exit yields of the newly issued bonds) as well as imputed yield curve values for the shorter end where no exit yields are observed, which are derived using a simple valuation model.20

The main result is that the present value haircut was in the range of 59–65%. Using a fixed discount rate for all of the old bonds leads to estimates close to 65% regardless of whether we use the exit yield of 15.3% or the somewhat higher rates at which yields stabilized in subsequent weeks (16.3%). However, the yield curve approach produces an average haircut that is notably lower; at around 59% (sensitivity analysis suggests a range from about 55% to 61%). The reason for this is that the valuation model used to construct discount rates for maturities of less than 10 years assumes that as of March 2012, much of the sovereign risk in Greece was concentrated in the period between the May 2012 election and mid-2015, as a result of election uncertainty, the continuing recession, and large debt repayment obligations to the ECB and (in 2014 and 2015) the IMF. As a result, the constructed discount rates in the maturity spectrum between 1 and 8 years, in which the bulk of Greece's old bonds were set to mature, are significantly higher than the average exit yield of 15.3%, resulting in a lower value of these bonds, and hence lower haircut estimates.

How did the losses suffered by Greek bondholders compare to previous debt restructurings? The answer is in Figure 4, which compares the current offer with virtually all debt restructuring cases involving private creditors since 1975, based on estimates by Cruces and Trebesch (2013). For the purposes of historical comparison, we stick to the 64.6% haircut that is obtained by using the average exit yield for discounting, since the same approach was also used by Cruces and Trebesch.

There are a number of cases of highly indebted poor countries, such as Yemen, Bolivia and Guyana, that imposed higher losses on their private creditors. However, the haircut exceeds those imposed in the Brady deals of the 1990s (the highest was Peru 1997, with 64%), and it is also higher than Russia's coercive 2000 exchange (51%). Within the class of high- and middle-income countries, only three restructuring cases were harsher on private creditors: Iraq in 2006 (91%), Argentina in 2005 (76%) and Serbia and Montenegro in 2004 (71%).

The figure also shows that the 2012 Greek exchange was exceptional in size, exceeding the next largest sovereign credit event in modern history, which to our knowledge was Russia's default on £1.7 billion in 1918, equivalent to just under 100 billion in 2011 euros. The Greek exchange also easily surpasses the German default of 1932–33, the largest depression-era default, comprising US$2.2 billion at the time, or approximately 26 billion in 2011 euros.

Bond-by-bond ‘haircuts’

An important characteristic of the Greek exchange was that every investor was offered exactly the same (and only one) package of new securities. At the same time, residual maturities across Greece's eligible bonds ranged from almost zero (20 March 2012 bond) to 45 years (Greece had issued a CPI-indexed 50-year bond in 2007). Because coupon rates were typically in the order of 4–6% – much lower than the exit yields – the present value of long bonds was much less than those of short bonds (for the same face value). As a consequence, there are large differences in haircuts across bonds. Short dated bonds – where investors were asked to give up full repayment that was almost within reach – suffered much higher haircuts (up to 80%) than longer dated bonds, whose face value would have been heavily discounted in the high yield environment prevailing in Greece after the debt exchange (Figure 5). This fact is robust to the discounting approaches compared in Table 3.21

We are not aware of a previous sovereign restructuring case with such a large variation in present value haircuts across instruments. There are a few examples of selective defaults, in which countries discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors as a group, or across types of debt instruments.22 But within these groups, sovereigns typically tried to limit the variation of haircuts across bondholders by adapting the terms of the new instruments to the terms of the old instruments.23 While there have been a number of previous exchanges with ‘one-size-fits-all’ offers – such as in Pakistan 1999, Moldova 2002 or Côte D'Ivoire 2010 – these tended to be simple operations directed at just a few outstanding instruments.

What explains the large variation in haircuts across bondholders? According to individuals close to the exchange, one motivation for the one-size-fits all approach was to keep it simple in order to get the deal done before 20 March 2012 when the next very large bond was coming due (€14.4 billion). It is also likely that the members of the creditor committee were mostly invested in longer-dated Greek instruments. Moreover, the Troika, Greece and the creditor committee may all have been sympathetic to taking a tough approach against short-term creditors, because many of these were distressed debt investors that had deliberately bought short-dated instruments at large discounts in the hope of still being repaid in full.

Debt relief

The present values and haircuts presented in Table 3 may not be a good estimate of the debt relief received by the Greek sovereign, for three reasons. First, as already discussed, from the perspective of a debtor country it may be appropriate to apply a discount rate that reflects expected future borrowing rates over the lifetime of the new bonds, rather than the yields prevailing immediately after a debt exchange. Second, Greece borrowed the quasi-cash portion of the ‘PSI consideration’ (€29.7 billion in short-term EFSF notes) from the EFSF. As a long-term liability with relatively low interest rates (namely, the funding costs of the EFSF plus a small mark-up), its present value can be expected to be lower than the value of the EFSF notes to investors (except at very low discount rates). Third, Greece borrowed at least €22 billion from the EFSF to compensate Greek banks for PSI related losses.24 The present value of this restructuring-related liability must be taken into account when computing the overall debt relief.

It is very difficult to say when, and at what rate, the government will be able to return to capital markets on a regular basis. While there are estimates for OECD countries linking debt, deficits and growth to borrowing rates (for example, Ardagna et al., 2007), these variables are themselves extremely difficult to forecast for Greece. We therefore compute debt relief based on three alternative assumptions about borrowing conditions in the long term.

The average nominal interest rate on public debt assumed by the IMF at the outer end (for 2030) of its March 2012 debt sustainability analysis, namely 5%. The expected long-run yield on the new Greek bonds implicit in the prices at which these bonds traded after issue, which is about 8%.25 A rate of 3.5%, which can be rationalized as corresponding roughly to Greece's expected borrowing rate from the official sector. This would be appropriate in a scenario in which Greece remains dependent on official sector support in the medium term.

For reference purposes, we also show the debt relief that would be implied by the exit yield of 15.3% (Table 4).

The first line of Table 4 shows the present value, at various discount rates, of Greece's €199.2 billion old bonds that were restructured in the exchange. The next two lines show the present values of the two new liabilities incurred by Greece as a result of the exchange – to the holders of the new bonds, and to the EFSF. The following line, ‘present value debt relief’ (%) is the mirror image of the ‘present value haircut’ line in Table 3. At a discount rate of 15.3%, this is much higher than the haircut computed for the same discount rate in Table 3, reflecting the fact that at this discount rate, Greece effectively obtained debt relief from two sources – the private bondholders, but also the EFSF, from which it had borrowed the €29.7 billion in quasi-cash given to investors at much more favourable rates than 15.3. However, at the lower discount rates that meant to reflect Greece's future borrowing costs, percentage debt relief – ignoring bank recapitalization costs – are about in line with the haircuts suffered by investors.

Next, the table computes debt relief net of bank recapitalization costs in both percentage and absolute terms. The main result is that the restructuring resulting in debt relief of €99–€106 billion in present value, or about 51–55% of GDP, very close to the face value reduction of €108 billion. This is very large in historical comparison. The next largest operation to restructure privately held debt, Argentina's 2005 debt exchange, achieved less than half that amount as a share of GDP, namely, about 22.5% of GDP, based on a discount rate of 7.7% (Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2007b).

3.1.2. How the free rider problem was overcome

Every holder of Greek bonds, even members of the steering committee that negotiated the terms of the exchange offer with Greece, was in principle free to accept or reject Greece's exchange offer. Furthermore, every creditor was a potential free rider in the sense that no individual creditor was large enough, assuming participation of all other creditors, to ‘sink’ the exchange on its own (in the sense that Greece would have missed the 90% participation threshold). This leads to the question of what ultimately induced the high creditor participation of almost 97%, notwithstanding a present value haircut of more than 50% for all but the most long-term creditors.

Creditor composition and political pressure are an important part of the answer. The majority of Greek bonds were in the hands of large Greek and European banks and insurance companies. This allowed Greece to negotiate its bond exchange offer ex ante, with a creditor committee that shared many features with the classic ‘London Club’ approach of restructuring of bank loans in the 1980s (see Rieffel, 2003). It also meant that European governments and regulators, that is, Greece's official creditors, were able to exert pressure on these banks to participate. As famously remarked by Commerzbank's Chief Executive Martin Blessing, the participation of large European banks in the restructuring was ‘as voluntary as a confession during the Spanish Inquisition’.26 The same is probably true for domestic Greek banks, which were asked by the Greek sovereign to participate. Hence, it is not surprising that on 6 March, just prior to the exchange deadline, the major members of the creditor committee released press statements reiterating their commitment to participate in the offer (Milne and Hope, 2012).

However, the members of the creditor committee held at most 40% of the debt eligible for the exchange. Additional debt may have been in the hands of other institutions amenable to official pressure, but according to market estimates in early 2012, these institutions together held at most €120 billion out of the almost €200 billion that were eventually exchanged. The problem was how to deal with the remaining €80 billion (at least) of potential free riders that might be tempted to ‘hold out’ in the hope of being repaid in full or receiving a better deal.

In solving this problem, Greece and its legal and financial advisors could look to the experience of previous distressed debt exchanges. Following the return to bonds as the predominant form of emerging market finance in the early 1990s, there was a widespread fear that the dispersion of these bonds in the hands of many creditors would make it virtually impossible to achieve orderly debt restructuring. Yet, history by and large proved these fears wrong: almost all debt exchange offers since the Brady deals of the 1990s have been successes in the sense that creditor participation has been high, and restructurings much quicker than in the era of bank finance (see Bi et al., 2011 and Das et al., 2012 for details). To deter free riding among dispersed bondholders, countries used a combination of three mechanisms:

Most frequently, by threatening potential holdouts with non-payment – an approach that is particularly credible when an exchange offer follows a default, as happened in Russia (2000), Argentina (2005) and a number of other cases – or undertaking actions to weaken their legal position in the event of litigation. In some exchanges, such as Ecuador (2000) and Uruguay (2003), countries used consent solicitations (‘exit consents’) to weaken the legal protections in the bonds of holdout creditors, taking advantage of the fact that the non-payment clauses of bond contracts can generally be changed with simple majority (Buchheit and Gulati, 2000).

Less frequently, by using ‘collective action clauses’ that allow a qualified majority of creditors to change the payment terms of the bonds against the opposition of a group of holdouts, if such clauses were present.27

Finally, through legal devices or financial enhancements that put tendering bondholders at advantage in future sovereign debt crises.28 This could be achieved through the already mentioned ‘exit consents’, which weaken the position of holdouts in absolute and relative terms, or by offering creditors cash, collateralized securities, securities issued by a more creditworthy borrower, or securities that are harder to restructure and hence de facto senior. Examples include the collateralized ‘Brady bonds’ offered to bank creditors that had suffered default in the 1980s and the Russian 2000 debt exchange, which replaced debt owed by a state-owned bank with Eurobonds owed directly by the Russian sovereign and issued under foreign law.

The July 2011 proposal was an attempt to deal with free riding only through the last mechanism, by offering an upgrade from Greek law to English law combined with collateralized principal. Even after the official creditors had decided on ‘stronger PSI’ in October 2011, the idea of undertaking a ‘purely voluntary’ debt exchange relying only on positive participation incentives lingered on. By January 2012, however, it became clear that there was a problem with this approach: offering a safer instrument will not, by itself, address the free rider incentive for creditors holding sufficiently short term bonds. Conditional on a successful voluntary exchange, short-term bondholders are very likely to be repaid in full even if the claim is junior to the new debt, as the chance of a new debt crisis in the (short) period between the exchange and the maturity date is very low. Based on this argument, it seemed unlikely that the holders of a €14.5 March bond, whose participation was considered essential, would agree to tender.

The end result was that Greece relied on all three of the above mechanisms, but with different emphasis, and in new ways (see Zettelmeyer et al., 2013 for more details).

First, and most importantly, it introduced a powerful collective action mechanism into domestic law bonds. In February 2012, the Greek parliament enacted the Greek Bondholder Act, which allowed it to impose the new payment terms on holdouts with the agreement of two-thirds of face value weighted votes. Unlike the English-law bonds, this threshold applied across bonds rather than just bond-by-bond, subject only to a participation quorum of at least 50% of face value. In the end, this aggregation feature turned out to be pivotal for the results of the debt exchange, as it allowed the restructuring of 100% of the Greek law sovereign bonds, which themselves made up over 86% of the bonds covered by the restructuring.

Second, the bundle of new securities was designed to be as attractive as possible, for a given haircut, to bondholders who feared (correctly) that Greek sovereign risk would remain high even after a successful debt exchange. Three features of the ‘PSI consideration’ made it particularly valuable to investors in these circumstances:

First and most importantly, bondholders were offered an exceptionally large cash sweetener, in the form of highly rated EFSF notes – worth 15% of the ‘old’ bond's face value and due to mature in 2013 and 2014.29 These notes turned out to be by far the most valuable component of the securities bundle offered to creditors, representing almost two-thirds of its value (15 out of 23; see Table 3). Regardless of what happened to Greece in the future, participating investors would have this ‘bird in hand’.

The new bonds were issued under English law, and included standard creditor protections such as pari passu, negative pledge and cross-default clauses. Greek-law sovereign bonds contained almost none of these protections. However, the contract provisions were arguably less important than the governing law itself. Greek-law bondholders who had just experienced the power of the local legislature to change contract provisions retroactively would find some comfort in the fact that English law bonds would preclude a change of their contractual rights through legislative fiat.

The new bonds were issued under a ‘co-financing agreement’ that created an exact symmetry between Greece's debt service to the new bondholders and its debt service to the EFSF related to the EFSF notes and bills that it had received for the purposes of the debt exchange. In the event of a shortfall in payments by Greece, a common paying agent committed to distributing this shortfall pro rata between the EFSF and the bondholders. Hence, the co-financing agreement made it difficult for Greece to default on its bondholders without also defaulting on the EFSF. The co-financing agreement also stipulates that the payment terms of the new bonds cannot be amended without the consent of the EFSF, and imposed a cap on new bond issues.

Apart from making the ‘PSI consideration’ more attractive to risk-averse investors, the implication of the last two features was to commit Greece to an aggressive stance vis-à-vis holdouts in the event of a future default. Faced with the choice of defaulting on ‘old’ Greek law bonds whose terms could be changed through an Act of Parliament or on new bonds that exposed the Greek sovereign to litigation in foreign courts and forced it to also default on the EFSF, Greece would surely opt for the latter.

Finally, although the Greek government went out of its way to appear non-coercive before and in the language of the exchange offer – for example, the 24 February invitation memorandum refers to the exchange as a ‘voluntary liability management transaction by way of a voluntary bond exchange’ – it did, at the last minute, adopt a harsher tone towards potential holdouts. On 5 March, three days before the expiry of the exchange deadline, Greece issued a press release stating that ‘Greece's economic programme does not contemplate the availability of funds to make payments to private sector creditors that decline to participate in PSI’. On the same day, Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos was quoted as saying that ‘Whoever thinks that they will hold out and be paid in full, is mistaken’ (Reuters, 2012a).30

Although it is impossible to say exactly how much either the upgrade in ‘safety’ or fear of discrimination contributed to the success of the exchange offer, it is clear that the safety upgrade was viewed as essential ex ante and that one or both played a significant role ex post. Even a solid commitment by members of the creditor committee would not have been enough to ensure that the two-thirds majority threshold specified by the Greek Bondholder Act would be met. With hindsight, we know that over 82% of Greek law bondholders exchanged their bonds and an additional 3.3% voted in favour of the amendment, far exceeding the holdings of the institutions that were either members of the creditor committee or otherwise susceptible to regulatory pressure. Thus, there must have been a significant contingent of potential free riders (perhaps 20–30% of old principal) that opted in favour of the offer or amendment as a result of some combination of sweeteners and fear of discrimination.

4. From Debt Exchange to Buyback

Despite the success of the debt exchange and the associated approval of a second official bailout programme for Greece on 14 March 2012, high yields on the new bonds signalled the market's view that a second default in Greece continued to be a clear and imminent danger. Part of this had to do with domestic political and social opposition to the adjustment programme, which materialized in the general elections in May with the unexpected rise of the anti-bailout party Syriza. The ensuing political deadlock receded only after a second election in June enabled a pro-bailout coalition government under a new Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras (Figure 6).

However, continued high default risk also had to do with the design of the March debt exchange and the associated second bailout programme itself. Greece had received a high degree of debt relief, but only at the price of promising more austerity and structural reform which – given its economic and social troubles – did not seem plausible to many outside observers. At the same time, debt service after the exchange continued to be surprisingly high in the short term. This reflected the compromise that had made the debt exchange possible in the first place: getting official Europe and the ECB to agree to a restructuring required exempting the ECB and national central banks from a haircut, and also taking a soft approach vis-à-vis free riders. At the same time disproportionately high haircuts discouraged particularly short-term bondholders from taking part in the exchange. As a result of all these factors, the debts to ECB, national central banks and holdouts implied payments of more than €10 billion in each year between 2012 and 2015 (see Figure 3). This meant that there was no room for slippage: if official disbursements under the programme stopped or were delayed, a default on the ECB, in particular, was very much in the cards, and with it, potential exit from the euro.

In the event, programme payments were delayed, as the programme ran off track almost immediately as a result of the May and June elections and protracted negotiations with the new government. An initial set of disbursements under the March programme – €75.6 billion in total, three-quarters of which was financing for the debt restructuring and the associated bank recapitalization – took place between March and June, but over €36 billion in additional EFSF and IMF payments promised for the second and third quarter were withheld. Greece coped by continuing to cut spending, accumulating arrears on other government liabilities and selling T-bills to its banks. A critical moment came on 20 August when Greece repaid over €3 billion to the ECB, using ad-hoc financing from the ECB through the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) mechanism.31

At the same time, the economic news was not encouraging, especially with respect to growth. As summarized by the IMF (2013, p. 11) ‘the deepening recession created further headwinds for fiscal adjustment, increased the burden of Greece's debt, and raised substantially the probability that Greece would get stuck in a weak-confidence, high-debt, low-growth trap’. The privatization programme came to a near-complete halt, yields on Greek bonds remained high even after the political crisis had been resolved, and by September 2012, it became clear that the budget shortfall was even larger than expected, up to €30 billion, thus substantially increasing the Greek Debt/GDP ratio for 2012.

Against this backdrop, the IMF began to demand further debt relief for Greece as a condition for further IMF disbursements. Given that by far the largest creditor of Greece at this point was the EU – both through the EFSF, and through the ‘Greek Loan Facility’ (GLF) that had financed the first bailout programme – meaningful debt relief could only come from the official sector. At the same time, unsurprisingly, eurozone leaders balked at the idea of large-scale debt relief so soon after large-scale official lending had been made available to Greece at terms that were already significantly more favourable than the first package. There was particular resistance against politically highly visible cuts in the face value of debt owed by Greece.

The result was a compromise within the Troika, involving four elements. First, longer maturities and lower interest rates on GLF and EFSF lending (but no face value reduction). Second, a commitment to return profits made in connection with ECB purchases of Greek bonds to Greece. Third, EFSF funding for a partial buyback of Greece's newly issued bonds, which were still trading at a large discount (prior to the announcement, about 28 cents for each euro of face value). Finally, a commitment by the Eurogroup to ‘consider further measures and assistance, including inter alia lower co-financing in structural funds and/or further interest rate reduction of the Greek Loan Facility, if necessary, for achieving a further credible and sustainable reduction of Greek debt-to-GDP ratio, when Greece reaches an annual primary surplus, as envisaged in the current MoU, conditional on full implementation of all conditions contained in the programme’.32 The latter was likely important to the IMF, which was concerned that the debt relief granted by the EU was not going far enough.33

4.1. The December buyback: a boondoggle?

The most controversial element of the November package, and the only one involving private creditors, was the proposed buyback of Greek sovereign bonds issued only 9 months earlier. From the perspective of eurozone leaders, the appeal of this proposal was that it allowed a face value reduction of Greek debt without requiring an unpopular nominal write down on the official debt. Indeed, when the buyback was carried out on 12 December 2012, it used €11.3 billion in EFSF financing to retire €31.9 billion of Greek bonds, hence reducing the face value of Greece's debt by €20.6 billion.34 On this basis, it was declared an important success in the quest to put Greece's debt on a sustainable path,35 and cleared the way for the next instalments of EFSF and IMF disbursements.

At the same time, the average price at which Greece had bought back its debt, 34 cents per euro of face value, had increased by over 20% since the buyback was announced in late November. This seemed to confirm a problem with voluntary buybacks that economists had been pointing out for some time, triggered by the experience of the Bolivian buyback of 1988:36 namely, that their benefits tend to be appropriated by the creditors, in the form of a higher market value of debt, rather than by the debtor country. The question is to what extent this is true for the case of Greece, and whether and to what extent Greece improved its debt sustainability as a result of the buy back.

To answer these questions, it is necessary to briefly recall the essence of the ‘buyback boondoggle’ argument – that is, the claim that voluntary debt buybacks are generally a waste of public funds. The argument consists of two parts.37

The first is that the reduction in debt service obligations expected from the buyback – and hence the increase in the probability that a distressed sovereign will actually be able to service the remaining debt – will also result in a secondary market increase of the debt, after the buyback is announced. The average buyback price will therefore be generally higher than the initial price of the debt. This result is an inescapable consequence of the voluntary nature of the buyback. If debtors expect the debt to decline as a result of the buyback, they will no longer be willing to sell at the initial price, because this no longer reflects the true value of the debt. As a result, ‘negotiated buybacks’, which cap the extent of the price rise (or try to lock in the pre-announcement price), are always preferable to voluntary buybacks, at least from the perspective of debt reduction.

Note, however, that the extent to which the price actually rises in a voluntary buyback will depend on the circumstances. For example, compare a situation where the cash used in the buyback is a gift from donors (as in the famous 1988 Bolivian case) with another where it is borrowed from a senior lender such as the IMF. In both cases, the expected net reduction in the face value of debt service obligations will tend to push the price up. But in the case of the IMF-financed buyback, there is a countervailing effect: private borrowers realize that if there is a debt problem, they will be last in line. This means that the buyback price will rise less compared to the pre-buyback price (and it is even possible to construct examples where it would fall).

The second part of the argument, which is more controversial,38 assumes that the benefits of the buyback to the country can be judged by the change in its net asset position as a result of the buyback, with debt measured at market prices. For example, the buyback critics of the late 1980s would feel that a situation in which the market value of the debt is unchanged after the buyback – because the reduction in face value is offset by an increase in the price of the debt, as happened in Bolivia – is clear waste of public money. Implicit in this view is the assumption that debt repayment involves a zero-sum game between a debtor country and external creditors in which the value of the debt reflects the expected resource flow from debtors to creditors.39 However, this may not be true in the situation in which a default has large domestic costs, or involves a deadweight loss. In such cases, a buyback that helps the country avoid default may well be welfare improving even when it leaves the market value of the debt unchanged (indeed, even if it increases the market value of the debt).

In the case of Greece, which had large domestic creditors and undertook the buyback in the context of a broader deal with its official creditors, it is almost surely wrong to use the change in the market value of its net assets as the yardstick for whether the buyback should be considered a success. Nonetheless, since the literature used this yardstick for other famous cases, it is interesting to see how the Greek exchange would fare by comparison. To do this, it is necessary to select a ‘pre-buyback price’. The most obvious candidate is the price on 23 November 2012, just before the official buyback announcement.40 Note that this could be wrong in either direction. In particular, the change in price between 23 November and 12 December could well overstate the impact of the buyback announcement because it was a reaction not just to the buyback but also to the other elements of the November package (including the resumption of EU–IMF disbursements, and official sector debt relief); but it is also possible that it understates the impact of the buyback, as the latter may have been priced in to some extent, following remarks by ECB Board member Jörg Asmussen in mid-October (see Reuters, 2012c). As an alternative, one can hence use the secondary market price of 11 October (just before Mr Asmussen's remarks became public); this would generate an upper bound on the price change that may have been driven by the buyback.

Based on the 23 November reference price (27.8 cents/euro), the market value of Greek bonds dropped by €7 billion as a result of the buyback: from €17.1 billion to €10.1 after the operation was completed on 12 December. To finance this debt reduction, Greece's debt to the EFSF went up by €11.3 billion in face value. There are, of course, no observable market prices for this debt; but it is a fair assumption that the default risk faced by the EFSF following the buyback is no longer very different from that of the private sector: given what little privately held debt Greece has left at this point (see below), it is hard to imagine a scenario where Greece would again restructure its debts to private creditors and not also to the EU. Using the average bond yield prevailing immediately after the buyback (11.75%) to discount debt service flows to the EFSF leads to a present value of just €2.7 billion – reflecting the low interest rates and very long maturity of this EFSF loan (it amortizes linearly between 2023 and 2042). Hence, the market value of Greece's net asset position would have improved by €7–€2.7 = €4.3 billion, a net return of 157% on the €2.7 billion value of extra borrowing from the EFSF.

What if the price of 11 October is used as the reference? In this case, the initial market value of the debt that was bought back would be much smaller, namely just €13.7 billion, but this would still imply a drop of €3.5 billion in market value as a result of the buyback, which exceeds the €2.7 billion increase in the value of the EFSF borrowing by €0.8 billion. The net return is 31%.

These calculations are obviously sensitive to the way in which the EFSF debt is discounted. If it is discounted at a sufficiently lower discount rate than the market yield of 11.75%, the improvement in Greece's net asset position due to the buyback goes away. Using the 23 November reference price, that threshold discount rate would be about 6%; using the 11 October reference price, it would be 10%. But the point here is merely that based on a market value yardstick, it is not possible to condemn this buyback unless one assumes that the risk of a Greek default to the EFSF is significantly lower than that of a new default to the private sector.

We next move to the question whether the buyback achieved any debt relief that made it easier for Greece to repay its remaining debt in full. Given that this was the stated purpose of the buyback, this strikes us as the key issue. To answer this question, we compute the impact of the buyback on the Greek debt burden by using the same discount rates as in the previous section – 3.5, 5 and 8% – to discount both the old flow (Greek bonds bought back) and the new one (new debt service to the EFSF). As explained before, the justification for using these rates is that they represent different guesses for the rates at which Greece might be able to transfer revenues over time, based on borrowing from either the market after it reopens or from the EFSF.

The main result, given in the bottom two rows of Table 5, is that in addition to a face value reduction of €20.6 billion, the buyback operation did in fact achieve a reasonable volume of present value debt relief, ranging from €12 billion for the highest of the three discount rates to just under €21 billion for the lowest discount rate, or 6.2–10.8% of 2012 GDP. These are not very large amounts, but respectable, given Greece's dire situation and the limited scale of the operation.41

The finding that the buyback did in fact reduce Greece's debt burden does not, of course, imply that this was the best way to use the extra EFSF financing. Leaving aside the fact that the EFSF money might have been better spent addressing social needs, preparing privatization or supporting structural reforms, there could have been more effective ways of using the EFSF financing even from the narrow vantage point of reducing Greece's debt burden.

Rather than conducting the buyback as an auction at a market price, it could have been conducted at a negotiated, pre-set price. For example, if the buyback would have happened at the price of 23 November 2012 (just before the buyback was officially announced), Greece would have obtained an extra 3–4% of GDP in debt relief (see Web Appendix, Table A7 for details). Had the issue price of 12 March been used – another defensible choice, as it would have meant no further losses for investors beyond those already sustained in the debt exchange – debt relief would have gone up by another 2% of GDP.42 Of course, achieving the same participation rate at these lower prices would likely have required some degree of coercion. The official sector faced a choice between sticking to the principle of a fully voluntary exchange and sticking to the aim of conducting the buyback at a price of 23 November 2012 or less, and it chose the former.

To conclude: the December buyback did lead to real debt relief. But more could have been provided if the buyback had been conducted differently.

Figure 7 shows the overall effect of the Greek restructuring on Greece's creditor structure. In less than a year, the structure of Greek government debt was turned upside down, with privately held debt (bonds and T-Bills) now accounting for only about 20% of the total. Most strikingly, there was a near elimination of privately held sovereign bonds. In mid-February 2012, banks and other investors still held almost €206 billion of Greek bonds. But after the March/April exchange and the subsequent buyback this figure had shrunk to a mere €35 billion (€29.5 billion in the form of new bonds and €5.5 billion of old GGBs held by holdouts). At the same time, official loans by other eurozone governments increased from €58 billion in early 2012 to more than €160 in late 2012, with a further €35 billion committed for 2013. We are not aware of any other similarly drastic case of ‘credit migration’ from private into official hands in the history of sovereign debt.

Finally, what was the combined effect of the debt exchange and buyback on Greece's creditors? A creditor participating in both would have received 15 cents in quasi-cash and 31.5 cents of new face value per old unit of face value of quasi-cash in March or April, followed by 34 cents per unit of new face value in December. This sums to 15 + 0.315 * 34 = 25.7 cents per original face value. The creditor's alternative was to keep the original debt. Discounted at the 11.75% yield prevailing in the market after the buyback, this would have been worth just under 74 cents on the euro, implying a haircut of (1 – 5.7/73.9) = 65% – almost exactly the same result as obtained in Table 3 using the exit yield of 15.3. We conclude that participating investors lost about 65% of the value of their claims on average as a result of both restructuring operations, with wide difference between holders of short maturities, who lost up to 74%, and of longer maturities, who lost far less, as indicated in Figure 5.

5. Discussion and Implications for Future Restructuring in Europe

For students of debt restructurings, there were many aspects of the Greek restructuring that were, to use the technical term, cool. The retrofit CACs, the size of the exchange and the size of the haircut have all received attention from the financial press. The Greek deal also hit firsts (or near firsts) in terms of the use of aggregation provisions, the attempt to link repayments of new bonds and repayments to a multilateral, and in giving official creditors a veto over changes in bond payment terms or new debt issues beyond a specified maximum.

For the people of Greece and Europe, however, it is not legal and financial pyrotechnics that count, but what the restructuring ultimately delivered. In the following sections, we therefore draw some normative implications from our case study. Was the decision to restructure Greek debt the right one? Could Greece have got a better deal? Will the restructuring make future debt restructuring in Europe easier or more difficult? And to what it extent does Greece's restructuring provide a template for other eurozone countries seeking to restructure their debts?

5.1. Was the Greek restructuring a good idea?

Economic theory answers the question of when it is optimal for countries to default roughly the same as common sense would. In the presence of default costs – financial disruptions and output costs – defaults should be rare events, but can be desirable when countries face high debt and large solvency shocks (see Adam and Grill, 2012, and references therein). The presence of collateral damage on other countries – contagion – changes the interpretation of default costs, but does not change the answer; except for one key complication: it implies that there may be a second instrument – transfers across countries – as an alternative to default. This may help ex post, but creates a moral hazard problem ex ante, since debtor countries have control over their debt levels, the contracts they enter into and ultimately, their resilience to shocks.

Deciding whether the Greek restructuring was the right decision hence involves two questions. First, had Greece reached the threshold level of distress and high debt which would justify a debt restructuring purely from a domestic standpoint, that is, abstracting from contagion? Second in light of the collateral damage that the Greek restructuring was likely to inflict on other countries – and arguably did inflict – was there a better alternative?

With respect to the first question, a first pass are the IMF's debt sustainability analyses (DSAs), conducted every 3–6 months since the beginning of the May 2010 programme. While for the first year or so IMF staff reluctantly concluded that Greek debt was sustainable (although it consistently refused to say that this was true ‘with high probability') the Fund gave up by October 2011, when its DSA noted a more severe drop in output than expected (projected at –5.5% in 2011 and 3% in 2012), a slower expected recovery, continued exclusion from capital markets, and lower privatization proceeds. Under the baseline scenario, the debt to GDP ratio would rise to 184% by 2014 and remain above 130% even in 2030, despite a continued primary surplus of at least 3.5%.

Was the IMF's take on Greece too pessimistic? In an analysis conducted a month earlier, William Cline (2011) argued that the July 2011 PSI agreement greatly helped debt sustainability and would suffice if Greece only stuck to its fiscal adjustment targets. In his baseline scenario the Greek debt ratio would peak at 175% in 2012 and then fall to 113% by 2020. Several reasons explain Cline's more favourable view. He assumed a more optimistic growth path (of +0.6% in 2012, and +2.1% in 2013), as well as higher privatization receipts than the IMF. He also predicted a primary surplus of 6–7% from 2014 onwards. With hindsight, these assumptions do not seem plausible, particularly for a country with a weak fiscal track record. Between 1990 and 2007, the average Greek primary surplus was 0.6% of GDP despite the economic prosperity of these two decades.

This leads to the second question: accepting that the debt was unsustainable; might a better approach have been to deal with the Greek debt problem through a mixture of conditionality and large transfers – genuine transfers, not just loans? The Greek PSI decision arguably contributed to the widening of the Eurozone crisis in the summer of 2011, when the crisis spread to Italy and Spain (see Ardagna and Caselli, 2012); and is threatening Europe again today, since the crisis in Cyprus is in part a consequence of the Greek default. Given the enormous costs of a eurozone break-up and disorderly defaults in larger countries, would it have been better to resolve the Greek crisis through official transfers rather than PSI?

We do not think so, for three reasons.

Even after a €100 billion transfer from the private sector and a maturity extension and interest reduction in its official loans, Moody's (2012) continues to consider the Greek debt unsustainable, and the IMF continues to suggest that further ‘official sector involvement’ in Greece might be needed. Hence, to both substitute for the private restructuring and address the Greek debt sustainability issue, the official transfer (not just loan) to Greece would have had to be enormous. Cross-country transfers of this magnitude should not occur outside a fiscal union which exercises centralized control.

Even though the decision to restructure was risky and quite possibly did contribute to the spread of the crisis in July 2011, the eurozone had instruments to contain these risks – primarily, vested in the European Central Bank – and eventually exercised them, albeit reluctantly and after an initial learning period.

Finally, the outcome of the March–April exchange itself proved many critics wrong, some of which had gone as far as arguing that there could be no such thing as an orderly debt restructuring (Bini Smaghi, 2011). Not only was it orderly, but it took place swiftly (within 6 months since the start of negotiations), with high participation and no significant legal disputes. The losses imposed by the restructuring did not trigger knock-on insolvencies of systemically important institutions. And the much-feared triggering of CDS contracts in March 2012 went by with not even a whimper (see Web Appendix 6).

We conclude that even if the alternative of a large-scale official transfer had been politically feasible – which it was not – the debt restructuring was the right thing to do. It was a necessary, albeit not sufficient, step towards ending the debt crisis.

5.2. Could the restructuring have been handled better?

We have so far argued that the Greek restructuring was both unavoidable and successful in the sense of being orderly, reasonably quick, and in providing significant debt relief. Unfortunately, it fell short in other critical respects. Most importantly; it failed to clearly restore Greece's debt sustainability; it perpetuated the mutual dependency between Greece and its official creditors by leaving large debt payments to the ECB and national central banks out of the restructuring; and it set precedents that probably made future restructurings in Europe more difficult. In the following, we briefly elaborate on these points.

The design and execution of the Greek restructuring can be interpreted as an attempt to make it as gentle as possible on European and Greek financial institutions – particularly long-term creditors – conditional on reaching the nominal debt reduction target set in October 2011 without restructuring the holdings of the ECB and other central banks. Granted, the exchange may not have felt very ‘gentle’ to bondholders suffering losses of 65% or more, particularly if they were among the majority whose bond contracts had been retroactively changed by the Greek parliament to make them easier to restructure. However, these features were the direct consequence of the Troika-imposed decisions to both exempt the ECB and achieve a given amount of debt relief. Subject to these constraints, the design and conduct of the exchange went out of its way to maximize carrots and minimize sticks. This is apparent in the exceptionally high reliance on cash ‘sweeteners’ as well as the seniority upgrade; the fact that domestic law was not used to change payment terms but merely introduced a collective action provision; the fact that unsuccessful holdouts received exactly the same bundle as participating creditors (as opposed to keeping their old bonds with modified payment terms, for example, which would have put them at a disadvantage); the fact that non-payment threats were almost entirely avoided; the auction-based (rather than negotiated) December buyback; and last but not least, the fact that all holdouts so far have been repaid in full and on time. In addition, Greek banks were compensated for restructuring related losses.

This approach by and large succeeded both in making the exchange comparatively non-coercive (see Web Appendix 5), and in avoiding a financial collapse in Greece and Europe (with one significant glitch: the large collateral damage inflicted on Cypriot banks, which unlike their Greek counterparts were not compensated for restructuring-related losses). However, not all ingredients of the restructuring can be justified in terms of these objectives, particularly the more favourable treatment of long-term creditors, and the fact that even ECB profits on Greek secondary market purchases were initially not returned to Greece. More importantly, the approach had significant costs, some of which have already become apparent, while others may come back to haunt Europe if it attempts additional debt restructurings.

First, from the perspective of the Greek taxpayer, the restructuring left money on the table and/or created new fiscal burdens. Other than the lack of ECB participation, the single two most costly decisions in this respect were the ‘one size fits all’ approach, which imposed far lower haircuts for longer term creditors than the 70–75% imposed on debt coming due before the end of 2015, and the decision to fully recapitalize the Greek banks using EFSF notes (rather than requiring a contribution from the creditors of these banks). In Zettelmeyer et al. (2013), we show that imposing a uniform haircut of 70% on all private creditors would have resulted in an additional reduction in the face value of Greek debt of €28 billion and present value of €21 billion. Additional debt relief could have been gained by requiring a somewhat higher haircut from Greek law creditors compared to English law creditors – in recognition of the fact that the former were offered an upgrade in governing law but not the latter;43 and from using legal techniques (such as exit amendments as used in Uruguay or Ecuador) to discourage foreign
