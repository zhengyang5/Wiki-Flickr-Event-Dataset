We just had another electoral earthquake in the euro area: Podemos-backed candidates have won local elections in Madrid and Barcelona.
The latter is dubious economics — the IMF’s own research doesn’t support enthusiasm about structural reforms, especially in the labor market.
What I would urge everyone to do is ask what happens if Greece is in fact pushed out of the euro.
(Yes, Grexit — ugly word, but we’re stuck with it.)
But the bigger question is what happens a year or two after Grexit, where the real risk to the euro is not that Greece will fail but that it will succeed.
