This blog is dedicated to the understanding of the current Greek (but also European) economic, political and institutional crisis.
It was created by Prof. Aristides Hatzis of the University of Athens , after many requests by his students who seek a source of reliable analysis on the Greek current affairs.
Its aim is to post commentary and reports published mainly in the major U.S. and European media and to encourage a rigorous discussion.
