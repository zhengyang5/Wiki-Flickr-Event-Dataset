I use red bars for the GIPSIs — Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Ireland Italy — and blue bars for everyone else.
There are basically three stories about the euro crisis in wide circulation: the Republican story, the German story, and the truth.
Well, let’s look at public social expenditures as a share of GDP in 2007, before the crisis, from the OECD Factbook:Hmm, only Italy is in the top five — and Germany’s welfare state was bigger.
You can slash the welfare state all you want (and the right wants to slash it down to bathtub-drowning size), but this has very little to do with export competitiveness.
But non-GIPSI European leaders should realize that what the GIPSIs really need is a general European reflation.
