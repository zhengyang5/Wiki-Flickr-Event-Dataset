Budget revenues were found to be lagging by a considerable 1 billion euros in the year?s first month, provisional January data compiled by the Finance Ministry showed on Tuesday.
Revenues posted a 7 percent decline compared with January 2011, while the target that had been set in the budget provided for an 8.9 percent annual increase.
At the same time the crisis is seriously hurting the competitiveness of Greece?s economy, resulting in a considerable drop in entrepreneurship.
Finance Ministry data showed that some 111,000 companies shut down in 2011, against just 75,000 new businesses being set up.
The consequence of that is the reduction of state revenues from corporate tax.
