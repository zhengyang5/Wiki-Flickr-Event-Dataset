Greece's debt managers agreed a huge deal with the savvy bankers of US investment bank Goldman Sachs at the start of 2002.
This credit disguised as a swap didn't show up in the Greek debt statistics.
In 2002 the Greek deficit amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP.
At some point Greece will have to pay up for its swap transactions, and that will impact its deficit.
Goldman Sachs charged a hefty commission for the deal and sold the swaps on to a Greek bank in 2005.
