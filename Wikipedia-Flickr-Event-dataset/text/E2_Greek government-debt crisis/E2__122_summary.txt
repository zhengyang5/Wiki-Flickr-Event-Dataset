The first message I would like to send, is that the euro is much, much stronger, the euro area is much, much stronger than people acknowledge today.
If you compare today the euro area member states with six months ago, you will see that the world is entirely different today, and for the better.
A Europe that is founded on four building blocks: a fiscal union, a financial union, an economic union and a political union.
Then in the banking union or financial markets union, we will have one supervisor for the whole euro area.
The short-term challenges in our view relate mostly to the financial fragmentation that has taken place in the euro area.
