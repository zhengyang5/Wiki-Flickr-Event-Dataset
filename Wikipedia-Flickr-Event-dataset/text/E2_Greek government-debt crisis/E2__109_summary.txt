But another country with a big gap between expected and actually collected tax revenues, Poland, is showing how a determined government can tap this huge resource to great effect.
A European Union study published in September, 2016, showed Poland and Greece with very similar gaps in value added tax collection: In 2014, Poland collected 24 percent less VAT than was due according to the rules in effect, and Greece took in some 28 percent less.
In European countries, the VAT, similar to the U.S. sales tax, is one of the biggest sources of government revenue.
The government has also stepped up efforts to collect corporate income tax, while lowering it for start-ups this year, and reformed tax administration.
Meanwhile, economic growth is expected to reach 3.7 percent this year, according to the Bloomberg consensus forecast.
