Germany is profiting from the debt crisis by saving billions of euros in interest on its government debt, which has enjoyed a steep drop in yields due to strong demand from investors seeking a safe haven.
According to figures made available by the Finance Ministry, Germany will save a total of 40.9 billion ($55 billion) in interest payments in the years 2010 to 2014.
Financial investors regard Germany as a particularly safe creditor because of its solid state finances.
The Finance Ministry is trying to maximize the benefits of the low interest rates by placing more longer-term bonds at favorable rates.
According to the Finance Ministry, the costs of the euro crisis for Germany have so far added up to 599 million.
