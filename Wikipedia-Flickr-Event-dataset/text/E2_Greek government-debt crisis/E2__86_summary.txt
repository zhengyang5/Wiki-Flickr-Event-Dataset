ATHENS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Investors exercised about 2.4 percent of Alpha Bank’s 1.23 billion outstanding warrants to buy shares in Greece’s fourth-largest lender from bank rescue fund HFSF, its major shareholder, an official at the bank said on Wednesday.
About 218 million Alpha Bank shares will be bought from the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) as a result of the exercise, meaning proceeds of about 100 million euros ($137.71 million) for the bank rescue fund, the official said.
Investors who took part in the bank’s recapitalisation in June were given warrants as an incentive to take part in Alpha’s share offering.
The warrants give holders the right to buy shares from the HFSF in semi-annual exercise periods up to December 2017.
Warrant holders had the right to acquire 7.41 Alpha Bank shares per warrant at 0.448 euros per share in the first exercise period.
