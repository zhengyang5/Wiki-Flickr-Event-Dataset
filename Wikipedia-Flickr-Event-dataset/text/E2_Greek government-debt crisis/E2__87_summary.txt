ATHENS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Investors exercised only a fraction of National Bank’s (NBG) warrants to buy shares in Greece’s largest lender from the country’s bank rescue fund because the current share price was too low.
These give holders the right to buy National Bank shares from the HFSF at a set price, known as the strike price.
That means they will buy 255,410 National Bank shares from the HFSF, which owns about 84 percent of the bank.
National Bank shares were changing hands at 3.96 euros early on Tuesday.
Warrant holders had the right to acquire 8.23 National Bank shares per warrant at 4.37 euros per share in the first exercise period, which ran from Dec. 19 to 27.
