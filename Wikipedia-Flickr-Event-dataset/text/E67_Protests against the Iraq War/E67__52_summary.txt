The protesters were part of a larger group that had assembled at the Washington National Cathedral for a service on the fourth anniversary of the start of the war.
The demonstration began a weekend of protest that is to include a march on the Pentagon today.
Those who were arrested had been among almost 3,000 people who assembled at the cathedral at 7 p.m. for a rousing, emotional service that lasted more than 90 minutes.
"I am here tonight as a witness to the true cost of war," she said, "the betrayal and madness that is the war in Iraq."
Organizers are tying the protest to the 40th anniversary of the 1967 march on the Pentagon against the Vietnam War, saying it represents similar public anger.
