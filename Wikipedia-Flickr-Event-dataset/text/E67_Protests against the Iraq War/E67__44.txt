Thousands protest the Iraq war / SF also crowded with Loveparade revelers

(09-24) 16:05 PDT San Francisco (SF Chronicle) --

Tens of thousands of people marched in San Francisco and the East Bay today to urge the U.S. government to pull out of Iraq, joining anti-war protests in Washington and other cities.

Elsewhere in the city, thousands of people grooved to the sound of electronic music along Market Street and at Civic Center Plaza. And tonight, thousands more are expected to rock-out at SBC Park to Green Day, the celebrity punk band born in Berkeley.

Police estimated 20,000 people marched today. Organizers pegged the crowd at 50,000. Either way, it was one of the largest anti-war protests since the U.S. invaded Iraq two years ago. Protesters gathered in San Franciscos Dolores Park this morning, then marched for two hours to Jefferson Square Park, where the park was jammed with a standing room only crowd of bodies.

As they marched, people carried signs expressing outrage at everything from the war in Iraq to President Bush to the treatment of Palestinians. One man, dressed as Uncle Sam, carried an American flag with a peace sign.

A sixth-grader from San Jose held a handmade sign that said No war ever more on one side and No war anymore on the other. I am going to be a conscientious objector, said Dominic Dello Bueno, 11, who was there with his father and younger sister. I vote for peace not war. Some participants said they have been actively protesting the war for months or years.

I write letters, said Isabelle Corkins, 47, of Alameda, who with her husband and 4-year-old daughter. This is the only thing left that gives me a sense of doing something.

A student from Laney College in Oakland prepared to help carry a procession of black coffins, built to represent Iraqi children who have died in the conflict.

The idea is that we will stop protesting just because the war is continuing, but we wont, said Maryjane Jota, 20. Just because its old news, doesnt mean that its old news to the people who are dying.

Douglas Fisher, 61, held a large rainbow flag that said Peace in Italian. He said he got the flag in Sicily, and has taken part in several peace marches to oppose the war.

Somebody said it was a great day for a march, he said. I was thinking it would be great if we didnt have to come down here anymore.

Along a grassy median on Dolores Street, people set up 40 large placards marking casualties from the war. Each poster carried 60 photos and drawings, representing American soldiers and Iraqi citizens who have been killed in the conflict. (The U.S. military estimates that at least 1,900 soliders have died, and thousands more have been wounded in Iraq.)

Jim Haber, 43, said the posters were designed to show the human cost of the war. At least a half dozen counter-protesters, including a group of college Republicans from San Francisco State University, turned out to the military effort in Iraq.

One held a handmade sign that said Hey, losers. Stop demoralizing the troops.

Another said he thinks the U.S. military will need to remain in Iraq for years to help the country establish a democracy. He said he thought most of the protesters were radicals who wanted to overthrow the U.S. government.

There is a different way to peace, said Leigh Wolf, a 19-year-old broadcast major. This work can come to an end with patriotism instead of a socialist revolution.

By late afternoon, the crowd at Jefferson Park had thinned considerably.

A smaller protest was also held in Walnut Creek, where about 250 to 300 people marched from the citys Bart station to Heather Farms Park.

The demonstration drew a wide range of people  from seniors to kids holding peace signs. Many drivers honked noisily as they drove by marchers on Ignacio Valley Road, though some gave a thumbs down sign or a middle finger.

A 52-year-old lawyer said he joined the protest because of her outrage at the federal governments sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina. Faith Brewer said she thought the problem was exacerbated because too many resources were diverted to Iraq.

Too many people died in New Orleans, because of the war in Iraq, she said.

Brewer said she was particularly motivated to march in Walnut Creek, her hometown, because its considered a more conservative city in the liberal region.

People tend to think that nobody here is against the war in Iraq  that all the leftist, peaceniks are in San Francisco, she said.

Others held signs supporting peace and a pull-out of Iraq. On said Moms against the War. Another read, Bring the troops home now. A third said Peace is Patriotic. Unlike some other war protests, the focus appeared to be squarely on Iraq.

Sondra Runyan, who has a daughter in the Coast Guard, said she worried that Americans have become inured to the news of soldiers dying in Iraq.

It seems when you turn on the radio, they mention we lost two or three soldiers, and then theyre off to the sports scores, said Runyan, 47, of Martinez. People are immune to the pain these families are going through. This is destroying families.

Contra Costa County Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier, who attended the rally, said he plans to propose a resolution next month in support of Congressional legislation to set a deadline to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.

I dont see this as being out of mainstream, DeSaulnier said, as he looked over the crowd . It may be the tip of the iceberg.

If enough local elected speak out, we could be saving lives, he added.

The Walnut Creek rally ended peacefully at about 2 p.m.

Meanwhile, thousands of electronic music lovers gathered along Market Street for the 1 p.m. start of the citys second annual Loveparade.

The parade, featuring 24 floats with more than 200 disc jockeys from as far away as Israel, was expected to head slowly along Market Street, ending in a massive dance party at City Hall and the surrounding Civic Center Plaza.

An estimated 30,000 to 35,000 people showed up for the festival last year, and organizers hope to double that tally this year.

Though precise crowd estimates werent available, the sidewalks were packed 12-people deep in some places along Market Street as dance party regulars mixed with tourists. Can you feel the love? Its contagious, said Brian Tene, 27, of Daly City, dressed in a Superman outfit, complete with a red cape and sculpted foam chest. Look at everyone being themselves and being free.

Loveparade was first launched in Berlin in 1989, with the idea that techno music would help bridge the cultures of East and West Berlin after the fall of the Berlin Wall. While the Berlin event is now defunct, other Loveparades had popped up around the globe, including Mexico City and Tel Aviv.

The San Francisco event  which includes not only Euro-inspired techno music but hip hop, house, jungle, funk, progressive and trance music  has continued the theme that music celebrates diversity, promotes tolerance and fosters community.

The music sort of joins everyone together, said parade spokeswoman Jennifer Manger. If we can put all the music in one place, we can join those subcultures together in a community of love.

The Green Day concert was expected to begin at 7 p.m., ensuring traffic snarls would continue throughout the day. A BART commuter reported trains were jammed.
