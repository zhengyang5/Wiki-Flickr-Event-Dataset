The protest marked the second anniversary of the war

About 1,000 people attended the rally in Glasgow on Saturday afternoon.

The names of some of those who have died during the conflict were read out, along with a "name and shame" list of Scottish MPs who backed the war.

Maxine Gentle, whose soldier brother Gordon was killed in Iraq, urged Tony Blair not to send any more troops.

"My brother died for no good reason," said the 15-year-old.

Her mother Rose has set up her own campaign to end the UK's involvement in Iraq.

Mrs Gentle, who was addressing a rally in London on Saturday, said: "Tony Blair lied to us about this war.

"I have spoken to many boys from the Army and they don't know why they are there either.

"If they are sending the boys to war like these then why don't they have the right equipment? It's time they were brought back home, enough is enough."

The march and rally were organised by the Scottish Coalition for Justice not War and the Justice for Gordon Gentle Campaign.

Nicola Sturgeon, deputy leader of the Scottish National Party, said the event had attracted a cross-section of the country's population.

Campaigners called for the troops to be brought home

"The people of Scotland now know the truth about the war in Iraq," she said.

"They know that Tony Blair and his crony George Bush lied about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and used this as the basis for taking us into an illegal and immoral war."

Scottish Socialist Party national convener Colin Fox said the announcement that 3,000 Italian troops are to leave Iraq showed that the "illegal occupation" was unravelling.

"No more blood must be spilled - bring the troops home now," he said.

Vigils for peace were also being held in Dumfries, Falkirk, Ullapool and Kirkwall.
