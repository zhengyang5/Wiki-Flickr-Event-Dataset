A majority of Americans support the idea of a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq. When asked, Americans seem to prefer keeping troops for only about another year, but they expect troops to be there longer than that. Since the summer of 2005, opponents of the war have tended to outnumber supporters.A majority of Americans believe the war was a mistake. Fine Print Opinions on the war have been sensitive to the news out of Iraq. Opinions grew more positive after Saddam Hussein's capture in December 2003 and after the first elections in Iraq in late January 2005. They grew more negative when George W. Bush asked for more money to fight the war in September 2003, after insurgents killed U.S. troops in Fallujah, and when U.S. troops were found to have abused Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib in the spring of 2004.

Context Roughly half of Americans believe the United States can win the war in Iraq, but less than half believe it will. That could be an indictment of Bush's handling of the war; his approval ratings on the Iraq issue have been below 30% in recent months. Though overall support for the war is somewhat divided, most Americans believe the war is not going well for the United States and believe the United States is not winning. This has been the view since September 2003, though there have been a few exceptions following positive news out of Iraq.



Urgency: Overall Importance as Political Issue Iraq ranks at the top of the list when Americans are asked to assess the importance of various issues to their votes. Iraq consistently ranks at the top of Gallup's open-ended "most important problem" question. Iraq is seen as the single most important issue that Congress and the administration should address.



Impact on 2008 Vote Given its high salience with the public, there is reason to believe Iraq will be a dominant issue in the 2008 elections unless something dramatically different happens in the coming months. Democrats are now seen as better on the issue of Iraq. Americans say they trust the Democrats in Congress more than the administration when it comes to decisions on Iraq.

Key Subgroup Differences Views of the Iraq war are extremely partisan. Republicans overwhelmingly support the war; Democrats overwhelmingly oppose it. Independents tend to be more opposed than in favor of the war. Support for past U.S. wars -- including Vietnam -- was not as polarized along party lines as the current war.

The Bottom Line The war is an extremely high-priority issue for Americans and is likely to be one of the top issues in next year's election. Americans are divided on the war, along partisan lines, but on most measures a majority say that the war was a mistake and not worth the costs. Despite sentiment that the war is not going well for the United States, only about one in five favors an immediate withdrawal of troops. Most do support a gradual withdrawal of troops, preferably within a year, and a majority supports a congressionally mandated timetable for withdrawal by next year. How important will a candidate's past and current positions on the war in Iraq be in determining your vote for president in 2008 -- extremely important, very important, somewhat important, or not that important? Extremely important Very important Somewhat important Not that important No
