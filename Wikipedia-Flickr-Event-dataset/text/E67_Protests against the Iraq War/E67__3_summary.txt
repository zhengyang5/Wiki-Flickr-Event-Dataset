One began about noon at Lafayette Square, across from the White House, and was organized by the antiwar ANSWER Coalition.
Their message: The Iraq war can be and is being won, and the troops need unqualified support.
The march opposing the war was led by about 50 veterans who served in Iraq, according to Iraq Veterans Against the War.
March organizers said Iraq war veterans were more involved and visible at yesterday's protest than in any other similar demonstration since the conflict began.
Vietnam veterans chatted with Iraq war veterans young enough to be their children.
