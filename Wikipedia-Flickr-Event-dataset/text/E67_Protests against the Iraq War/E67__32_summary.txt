More than 500 demonstrators marched from Cowley into the centre of Oxford on 29 March in protest at the war in Iraq.
It was organised by the Oxford branches of Stop the War Coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Palestine Solidarity Campaign.
Ian Hodgson, of the Stop the War Coalition, said: "The powerful anti-war movement has already delayed war since autumn, giving thousands of civilians a few extra months to live.
For every week, day or even hour that we can shorten this conflict by, fewer Iraqis and fewer British and American soldiers will die.
"We want this march to be a peaceful yet powerful protest against Tony Blair's support for George Bush.
