Demonstrators then prepared symbolic flag-draped coffins marking the presence of the U.S. military in different foreign countries.
Howard University mechanical engineering student Brian Menafee organized an anti-war dance demonstration, seeking more help for students and lower military spending.
Josh Stieber, an Iraq war veteran, explained his transformation from soldier to protester.
