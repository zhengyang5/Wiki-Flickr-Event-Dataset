Organisers said 400,000 people joined in the march from the Embankment to a rally in Hyde Park on Saturday.
Bloodshed warningAmong the rally speakers were London Mayor Ken Livingstone, ex-MP Tony Benn and former United Nations weapons inspector Scott Ritter .
Mayor Livingstone told the BBC more than 400,000 people had taken part in the rally on the eve of the Labour Party conference.
"This will have an electrifying effect on the Labour Party conference and on those MPs opposed to war."
And the Labour Party Conference delegates had a duty to take the "ignition keys" away from Mr Blair.
