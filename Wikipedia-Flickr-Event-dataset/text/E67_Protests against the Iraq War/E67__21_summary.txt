Bush, Saddam brace for possibility of warIraq takes steps 'to destroy any foreign aggression'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As President Bush told the American people "there is little reason to hope [Iraqi leader] Saddam Hussein will disarm" and braced them for the possibility of war, the Iraqi leader put his country on a war footing ahead of a possible invasion by the United States and its allies.
The Central region, which includes Baghdad, was put under the command of Qusay Hussein, one of Saddam Hussein's sons.
Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, as the summit's host, will also attend.
The president also telephoned Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who supports the Bush policy but will not attend the summit.
Italy is not a Security Council member.
