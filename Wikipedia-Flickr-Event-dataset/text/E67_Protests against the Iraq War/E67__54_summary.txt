The march began near the Vietnam War Memorial, just a few blocks from the White House, and proceeded across the Potomac River toward the Pentagon.
Bush announced in January he was sending 21,500 additional troops to Iraq, further stoking anger over the war.
The march marked the latest protest in Washington against the war in which more than 3,200 U.S. troops have died.
Warning that a U.S. withdrawal would worsen the violence in Iraq, Bush has labeled such proposals an attempt by lawmakers to “micromanage” the war and has threatened a veto.
