Chicago Dispatch: Vets Toss Medals of Honor, Call NATO Summit a DisgraceOn an intersection in Chicago on Sunday, a line of United States Army and Marine Corps veterans stood in uniform, preparing to discard their medals of honor.
One by one, the Iraq Veterans Against the War stepped up to the mic to explain, in a few sentences, why they had chosen to reject the accolades they garnered in the army.
Then, one by one, they turned towards the NATO Summit that loomed beyond.
Cops surrounded the marchers entirely: NATO police, Federal Protective Services, state police, Chicago cops and mercenaries from private military companies like Academi (formerly Blackwater).
“May 20, 2012 is a historic day.” And yet this was not the first time soldiers in the United States have rejected their medals of honor, Winant recalled.
