As they marched, people carried signs expressing outrage at everything from the war in Iraq to President Bush to the treatment of Palestinians.
I vote for peace not war. Some participants said they have been actively protesting the war for months or years.
People tend to think that nobody here is against the war in Iraq  that all the leftist, peaceniks are in San Francisco, she said.
Meanwhile, thousands of electronic music lovers gathered along Market Street for the 1 p.m. start of the citys second annual Loveparade.
