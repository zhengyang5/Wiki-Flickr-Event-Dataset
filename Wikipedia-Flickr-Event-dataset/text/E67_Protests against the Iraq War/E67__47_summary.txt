Marchers protesting the Iraq war tried to deliver a mock coffin to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Monday, but police kept them off Pentagon grounds during a largely peaceful demonstration marking the war’s third anniversary.
They were cited for “failure to obey lawful orders,” a misdemeanor, said Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
The coffin, draped in black bunting and decorated with photographs from the war, “represents the massive casualties we’re seeing in the war in Iraq,” said Gordon Clark, 45, of Silver Spring, Md., of the group Iraq Pledge of Resistance.
Sheehan, whose soldier son Casey died in Iraq in 2004, said protesters were representing “millions of people around the world” who opposed the U.S.-led war in Iraq.
He lost an eye and an arm as a result of an Oct. 15 roadside bomb attack near Samara, Iraq.
