The D.C. protests come in the wake of massive demonstrations in England this past Friday, where 400,000 protesters attended demonstrations organized by the Stop the War Coalition and the Muslim Association of Britain.
This trend of protests across the globe conform with the fact that public sentiment is in strong opposition to the war.

All I ever hear is the ill-informed right-winger whining about how big bad Saddam is tricking the poor old USA.
We have to do better than the ill-informed right-wingers out there, and we have to speak as frequently and in as many places--not just on indymedia.
