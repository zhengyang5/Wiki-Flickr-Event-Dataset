About the same time, a total of 150 Peking University students convened on campus, displaying photographs of wounded Iraqi civilians and passing out pamphlets criticizing the war, Xinhua reported.
Just after 9:00 am, the protesters set off from the park to protest outside the US embassy.
From a dozen countries including the United States, Britain, Germany, Spain, Egypt and Syria, they are either working for foreign businesses in China, or foreign students or members of non-governmental organizations.
After arriving at the US embassy, protesters shouted "Stop the war" and "No more war."
Zhou Si, vice-president of the students' association, said the protest was organized via the campus' online network on Saturday night.
