Yesterday, while I talked with a Kenyan family about the World Social Forum in their front room, the news came over the television that the US had spent a trillion dollars on the war in Iraq.
The European Social Forum (ESF) held in Florence in the autumn of 2002 was subjected to a sustained attack by the Berlosconi government before it assembled.
Europes first Social Forum was its most successful.
Registering for the event is problematic as it becomes clear that the organisers have seriously underestimated the amount of people who will be coming.
The slogan for the demonstration is "Another World is Possible - even for slum dwellers".
