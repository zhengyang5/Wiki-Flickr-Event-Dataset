Up to 500,000 in anti-war marchSmoke flares are used by antiwar demonstrators in Florence RELATED European Social ForumFLORENCE, Italy -- Almost half-a-million people have taken part in a march through Florence in what was promoted as the first Europe-wide anti-war rally.
But a police source, while not giving an official figure, told CNN the organisers' estimate was "quite realistic" and that the number "could be close to 500,000."
The demonstration is part of the European Social Forum -- a gathering of anti-globalisation groups which is trying to decide how the movement should progress.
Guy Taylor, an activist with Britain's Globalise Resistance, told Reuters: "This is the first Europe-wide anti-war demonstration and I think it's vital it has a real impact.
The four-day European Social Forum is the first attempt to unite the array of anti-globalisation movements scattered across Europe.
