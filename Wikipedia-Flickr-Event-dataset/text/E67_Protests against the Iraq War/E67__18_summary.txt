Organisers of the biggest public demonstration in British history yesterday criticised the Government's response to the protests across the world against war in Iraq.
Until Saturday's demonstration last September's Liberty and Livelihood march, which attracted more than 400,000, was officially the biggest protest staged in Britain.
In London the group is calling for a mass protest in Westminster and Whitehall which it hopes will amount to "an occupation".
The size of the London demonstration was reflected at rallies elsewhere.
"Whatever [the number] it's the biggest rally in Australian history," said Senator Bob Brown, leader of the Greens.
