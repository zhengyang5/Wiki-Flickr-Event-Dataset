OLYMPIA - A protest became a melee on Olympia's waterfront Tuesday as sheriff's deputies arrested 22 people who stormed the port's gate.
And war protesters were back on the line Wednesday night -- as are the deputies.
The protesters hope to disrupt shipments of war supplies heading to Iraq.
The military transport ship Pomeroy continues to load cargo bound for Iraq, including Stryker vehicles and other military supplies for the Stryker Brigade from Ft. Lewis.
As long as the Pomeroy is in port, protesters plan to camp out here.
