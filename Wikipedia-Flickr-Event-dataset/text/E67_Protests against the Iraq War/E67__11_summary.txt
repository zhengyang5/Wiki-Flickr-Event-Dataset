Stop Your City — Stop The War George Bush and Tony Blair are determined to attack Iraq.
It will not be a war for democracy — it will be a war to control the oil-rich and strategically vital Middle East.
It will not be a war to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, because Iraq does not possess such weapons.
There will be no vote on war in parliament and only public outcry forced Tony Blair to allow even a “consultative” meeting of the House of Commons.
Make Thursday 31 October the day we stop your city or town to stop the war.
