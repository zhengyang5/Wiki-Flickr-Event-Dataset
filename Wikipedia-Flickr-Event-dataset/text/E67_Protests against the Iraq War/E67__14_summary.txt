Over 500,000 march in Florence against Iraq warBy our own correspondent12 November 2002In one of the largest peace demonstrations ever held in post-war Europe, more than 500,000 people marched in Florence, Italy November 9 to protest US plans for war against Iraq.
The official police estimate of the crowd size was 450,000, itself enormous in a city with a population of 500,000.
Banners denounced the war drive against Iraq, proclaiming, “Stop the War Coalition” and “No War on Iraq.” Placards called for a “globalisation” of the resistance and opposition to increasing militarism and the destruction of living standards.
In advance of a US invasion of Iraq, a movement against war is developing that is largely independent of the existing trade unions and social democratic parties.
The groups involved in Saturday’s demonstration have announced plans for a European-wide day of protest against war on February 15, 2003.
