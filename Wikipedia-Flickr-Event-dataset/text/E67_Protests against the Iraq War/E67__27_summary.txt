The protesters received a mixed reaction from local residentsUp to one third of the students at Ilkley Grammar School took part in a demonstration against impeding military action against Iraq.
Teachers were unable to prevent the morning walk-out and the decision was taken to close the school.
One protester said: "We want the town to know that Ilkley Grammar School is against the war."
Another demonstrator insisted pupils were not simply using the Gulf conflict as reason to leave school for the day.
Calder High School, in Halifax, has suspended 13 pupils following demonstrations on Tuesday.
