The police gave dispersal warnings to our picket of women and men, old and young, holding signs and chanting peaceful slogans.
Some of us did not want to give up that quickly, feeling it was our democratic right to picket on Oakland property.
These were young people, elderly men and women, people of many colors and economic backgrounds, teachers and union workers.
We were in there because we have the right to peacefully protest in our democratic nation.
If what happened at a protest in Oakland can't be reported in the media, how can we know what happened to people in Iraq?
