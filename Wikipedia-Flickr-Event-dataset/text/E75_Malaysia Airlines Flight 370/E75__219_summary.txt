An American law firm said it expects to represent families of more than half of the passengers on board the missing Malaysian Airlines flight in a lawsuit against the carriers and Boeing, alleging the plane had crashed due to mechanical failure.
Chicago-based Ribbeck Law has filed a petition in Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois for discovery against Boeing, manufacturer of the aircraft, and the airline.
The petition was meant to secure evidence of possible design and manufacturing defects that may have contributed to the disaster, the law firm said.
Though both Boeing and Malaysian Airlines were named in the filing, the focus of the case wouldbe on Boeing, Ribbeck's lawyers said, as they believed that the incident was caused by mechanical failure.
The law firm said it expected to represent families of more than half of the 226 passengers on board the flight, but declined to give details on how many families had agreed to be represented in the case.
