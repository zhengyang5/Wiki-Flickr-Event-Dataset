Media Release4 April 2014The Royal Australian Navy and Royal Navy have today commenced a sub-surface search for emissions from the black-box pinger from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.
This will be the first time that a sub-surface search will have been conducted in the search, in an attempt to detect the signal from the black-box of MH370.
“While the preference for search operations is to use physical evidence and then drift modelling to determine a smaller sub-surface search area, the search track is considered to be the best estimate possible for an area likely to contain the crashed aircraft.
“The equipment on Australian Defence Vessel (ADV) Ocean Shield and HMS Echo can only operate effectively at reduced speed, around three knots.
All the acoustic sensors, GPS positioning, tracking and frequency systems and positioning of the equipment completed a functionality test.
