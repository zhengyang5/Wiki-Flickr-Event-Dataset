The Austrian and Italian passports were added to INTERPOL’s SLTD database after their theft in Thailand in 2012 and 2013 respectively.
INTERPOL is also conducting checks on all other passports used to board flight MH 370 which may have been reported stolen.
At this time, INTERPOL is therefore unable to determine on how many other occasions these passports were used to board flights or cross borders.
Last year passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times without having their passports screened against INTERPOL's databases.
We would know that stolen passports were not used by any of the passengers to board that flight,” said Secretary General Noble.
