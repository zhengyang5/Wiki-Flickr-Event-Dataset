Ten planes and nine ships are searching the southern Indian Ocean.
Flight MH370 disappeared on 8 March as it was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
He will visit the new Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), where the southern Indian Ocean search is being led.
The British submarine HMS Tireless has also arrived in the southern Indian Ocean.
Several floating objects have been found in recent days, but none is believed to belong to the missing plane.
