Malaysian authorities moved to reassert their role in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner over the weekend and announced the creation of an investigation team.

On Saturday, Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s defense and acting transport minister, noting that the search for Flight 370 has been “difficult, challenging, and complex,” said that the country will continue to lead the investigation.

In accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization standards, the country will appoint “an independent ‘investigator in charge’” to lead the investigation team.

Mr. Hussein said that the team will be comprised of three groups. An airworthiness group will examine issues including maintenance records, structures, and systems. The second group, an operations group, will review flight recorders, operations, and meteorology, while the third group will be in charge of medical and human factors, investigating psychology, pathology, and “survival factors.”

The team will also include “accredited countries” and Malaysia said it will invite Australia, China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries to participate.

The government also announced the creation of three ministerial committees relating “to streamline and strengthen on-going efforts” with respect to the Flight 370 search.

The first is the Next of Kin Committee, which will provide families with information on the search operation and offer support after it has ended. This committee will “complement the work already being done” by Malaysia Airlines.

The second committee is charged with overseeing the formation of the investigation team.

The third committee will be responsible for issues relating to the deployment of Malaysian assets for the search operation. It will work “closely” with the Australian Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, as well as with other governments involved in the search.
