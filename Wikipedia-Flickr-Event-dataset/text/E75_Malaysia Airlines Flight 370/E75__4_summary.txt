SYDNEY (Reuters) - The hunt for missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 is on track to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, becoming the most expensive search in aviation history with 26 countries contributing planes, ships, submarines and satellites to the international effort.
Britain dispatched a nuclear-powered submarine, HMS Tireless, to assist in the search, without disclosing the vesselâ€™s previous location.
A FINANCIAL RECKONINGAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, whose country is leading the search, and his Malaysian counterpart, Najib Razak, have repeatedly said the cost of the search is not an issue.
Australia has so far contributed around half of the cost, with ships and aircraft on duty for some three weeks.
An earlier search in the South China Sea by Vietnam was estimated by local media to cost $8 million, a figure that has not been verified by officials.
