Dozens of angry relatives of Chinese passengers aboard the missing flight MH370 have demanded that Malaysia apologise for its handling of the investigation as they arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Beijing on Sunday.
Around two-thirds of the 239 people on board the flight were Chinese.
Malaysia Airlines has said it will fly families to Australia if the wreckage of the plane is found.
Commodore Peter Leavy of the Australian navy said the teams needed to find items, establish they were from flight MH370 and then try to establish where the plane might have hit the water.
"The search area remains vast and this equipment can only be effectively employed when there is a high probability that the final location of flight MH370 is better known," Leavy said.
