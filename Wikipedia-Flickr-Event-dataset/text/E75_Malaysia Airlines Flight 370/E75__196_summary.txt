This ascent occurred at the edge of the detection range of Kuala Lumpurâ€™s ATC system.
We now know that the Flight Management System altered that course (at the command of the flight crew) within 20 minutes of takeoff.
On the day of his final flight, Shah attended the sentencing hearing of Ibrahim and was said to be deeply upset about the verdict.
This deviation was the result of an alternate flight plan being executed by the Flight Management System computer.
The plane began to deviate from that flight plan after 20 minutes in flight without such notice to Kuala Lumpur ATC.
