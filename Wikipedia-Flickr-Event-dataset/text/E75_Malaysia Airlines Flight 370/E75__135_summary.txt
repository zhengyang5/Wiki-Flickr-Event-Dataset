Malaysian authorities moved to reassert their role in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner over the weekend and announced the creation of an investigation team.
On Saturday, Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s defense and acting transport minister, noting that the search for Flight 370 has been “difficult, challenging, and complex,” said that the country will continue to lead the investigation.
In accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization standards, the country will appoint “an independent ‘investigator in charge’” to lead the investigation team.
The government also announced the creation of three ministerial committees relating “to streamline and strengthen on-going efforts” with respect to the Flight 370 search.
The second committee is charged with overseeing the formation of the investigation team.
