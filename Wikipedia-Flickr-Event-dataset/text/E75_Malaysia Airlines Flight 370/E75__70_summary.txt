SEPANG: There are indications on military radar that flight MH370 could have made a “turn-back”, RMAF chief Jeneral Tan Sri Rodzali Daud said.
He added recordings captured from the radar had shown a turn-back, which is an aviation term that refers to a flight which had deviated from its original route and into a reciprocal heading.
From the recording on the radar, we realised that there is a possibility that the aircraft had made a turn-back.
A senior airline pilot instructor said a turn-back is not unusual and is done due to medical emergency, technical problems or even security reasons.
“A turn-back by MH370 is very unusual as there was no official communication prior to the manoeuvre,” he said.
