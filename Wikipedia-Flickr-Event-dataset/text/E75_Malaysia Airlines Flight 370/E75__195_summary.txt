BEIJING (AP) â€” China on Friday urged Malaysia's government to release any information it has regarding the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner to help narrow the search area.
The Beijing-bound aircraft last communicated with air traffic base stations east of Malaysia over the South China Sea.
"China urgently appeals to Malaysia for all information they have regarding the search," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei.
"That will not only help China with its search, but also help all sides in the search to make their search more effective and accurately targeted."
Dunleavy said that he could not provide any new information, but that he would work on obtaining updates from search officials.
