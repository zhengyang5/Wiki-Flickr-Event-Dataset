Chinese boycott Malaysia over missing jetlinerEven a popular singer, Fish Leong — an ethnically Chinese Malaysian who is pregnant – has been beset by threats on her microblog, with angry Chinese cursing her unborn child.
Of 227 passengers on the ill-fated flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, 153 were Chinese nationals.

Chinese celebrities have jumped on the anti-Malaysia bandwagon, using their microblogs to drum up support for the boycott.
