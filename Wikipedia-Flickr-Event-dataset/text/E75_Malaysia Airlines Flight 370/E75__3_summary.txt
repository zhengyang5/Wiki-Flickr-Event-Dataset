A 55-page report released by the Australian government concluded that the underwater search for the plane should resume in the new 60,000 sq km area.
Expensive searchThe underwater search for the plane was put on hold to allow more time for survey vessels to map the ocean floor.
Several teams working independently of each other have reached similar conclusions relating to the new search area, the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos says.
The search for the missing airliner is already among most expensive in aviation history.
