A large gap in radar on Australia's western coast line could be the reason why no radar picked up the last movements of flight MH370.

More than two weeks after it went missing, the Malaysian PM confirmed the Malaysia Airlines flight crashed into the ocean off the West Australian coast.

But the announcement has raised questions about the security of Australia's radar system, and how an unidentified passenger jet, way off course, could travel the length of the west coast without being detected?

Mark Davis looks at the sophisticated surveillance systems that should have been able to spot MH370 heading our way and looks at the possible dangers the radar gaps have.
