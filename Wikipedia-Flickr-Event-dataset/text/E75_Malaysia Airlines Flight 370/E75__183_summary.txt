[Avionics Today March 19, 2014] Malaysia Airlines Prime Minister Najib Razak clarified a statement released over the weekend regarding the disablement of the missing flight MH370 jet's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS).
The transponder system that was reportedly switched off is used by Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) to track the aircraft with radar coverage.
Disabling that system is a little more complicated and would require the removal of the circuit breakers that correspond with the ACARS.
What occurred after the last known radar contact with MH370 will remain unknown until officials can access the missing aircraft's flight data recorder.
"It is also important to recognize that the precise time ACARS was disabled has no bearing on the search and rescue operation.
