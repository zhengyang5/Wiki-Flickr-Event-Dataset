Asked to comment on the privatization plan on Wednesday, a Khazanah official said the fund had nothing to add to its June statement.
Taking MAS private could enable Khazanah to restructure it with little interference from shareholders and the powerful airline union, analysts say.
The airlines’ profitable units include MAS Engineering, Airport Terminal Services and its budget airline unit Firefly.
Bankers said declaring MAS bankrupt was not a decision the government would likely favor as it could harm the airline’s chances of selling off the profitable units.
