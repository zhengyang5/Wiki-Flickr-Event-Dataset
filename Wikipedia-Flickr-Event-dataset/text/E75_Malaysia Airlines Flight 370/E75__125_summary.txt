Juanda (@mingalababya) Could this piece found in South Africa be from the engine cowling with the Rolls Royce logo of #MH370 ?
South African archaeologist Neels Kruger told how he found the piece while walking along a lagoon on Monday afternoon.
Kruger then alerted the South African Civil Aviation Authority and the Australian authorities who are searching for the plane in the Indian Ocean.
News of that discovery led a South African teenager to reveal he had found a metre-long piece of material on a beach in Mozambique while on holiday with his family in December.
Meanwhile a second piece from Reunion has been all but ruled out as wreckage from MH370.
