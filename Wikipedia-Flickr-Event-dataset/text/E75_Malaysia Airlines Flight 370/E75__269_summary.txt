Well, that didn’t take long.
Not even a month after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 captured the world’s attention when it disappeared on March 8, The Smithsonian Channel will air a special on the doomed aircraft.
The one-hour documentary, “Malaysia 370: The Plane That Vanished” — premiering Sunday at 9 p.m. — will take a detailed look at the Boeing 777, the technology involved in the still-ongoing search and how aviation procedures may be changed in the wake of the disaster.
The special will feature experts from the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum and the National Transportation Safety Board, among others, examining the evidence of the case.
