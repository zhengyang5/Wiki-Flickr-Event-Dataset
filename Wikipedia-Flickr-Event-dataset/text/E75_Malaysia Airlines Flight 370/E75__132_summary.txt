All debris thought to be from the plane has so far been found in East Africa.
But some relatives say there has been no systematic search for further wreckage and that some possible findings appear to have gone ignored.
Malaysia is in charge of co-ordinating collection of any suspected debris, most of which has been sent to Australia for examination.
So far, six pieces have been found that are considered certain or highly likely to have come from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.
