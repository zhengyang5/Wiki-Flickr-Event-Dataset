KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS) - Malaysian police are investigating a flight engineer who was among the passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as they focus on the pilots and anyone else on board who had technical flying knowledge, a senior police official said.
A flight engineer is responsible for overseeing systems on a plane during flights to confirm they are working correctly and to make repairs if necessary.
Mr Selamat said he and other family members were supposed to visit Mr Khairul's new house this month.
But Mr Khairul had told his father on Thursday he had to go for a job in Beijing and that they would reschedule.
He would come visit us at least once a month," Mr Selamat said.
