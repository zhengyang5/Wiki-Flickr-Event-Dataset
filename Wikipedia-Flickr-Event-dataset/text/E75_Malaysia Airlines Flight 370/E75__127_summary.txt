Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai says both pieces of debris are consistent with panels found on a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft.
PUTRAJAYA: The debris found in South Africa and the Mauritian island of Rodrigues were confirmed to be "almost certainly" from MH370, according to Malaysian transport minister Liow Tiong Lai on Thursday (May 12).
"As such, the team has confirmed that both pieces of debris from South Africa and Rodrigues Island are almost certainly from MH370," said Mr Liow.
The Malaysia Airlines flight vanished in March 2014 when en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with 239 people on board.
Given this, the ATSB concluded that "part no.3 was a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 engine cowling segment, almost certainly from the aircraft registered 9M-MRO", which operated as MH370.
