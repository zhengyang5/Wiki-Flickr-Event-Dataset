The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has released two new reports that analysed data gathered during the surface search for Malaysia Airlines MH370.
The area captured by the imagery was not searched from the air, but is close to the underwater search area for the missing aircraft, says the ATSB.
The images were taken just west of the seventh arc in the vicinity of the new search area proposed by ATSB in 2016.
Experts from Geoscience Australia examined the images and classified 12 out of 70 identified objects as "probably man-made".
The search for the missing aircraft concluded in January.
