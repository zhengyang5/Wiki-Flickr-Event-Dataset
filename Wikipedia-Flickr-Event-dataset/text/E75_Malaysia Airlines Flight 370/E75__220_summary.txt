Chicago-based Ribbeck Law, which also represents 115 passengers aboard the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 that crashed in San Francisco in July, has filed a petition on behalf of Januari Siregar, whose son was on the Malaysia Airlines flight.
“We believe that both defendants named are responsible for the disaster of Flight MH370,” said Monica Kelly, lead lawyer on the case.
Based on signals sent out by the aircraft, officials reached the conclusion that the crash site was in the Indian Ocean.
The search recommenced on Wednesday, after gale-force winds and heavy rain halted operations the day before.
The current search area is also located in an area with great underwater volcanic activity, making the seafloor extremely rugged.
