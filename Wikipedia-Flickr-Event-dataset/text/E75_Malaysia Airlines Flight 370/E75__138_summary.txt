I am pleased to announce that Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AC AFC will lead a new Joint Agency Coordination Centre (the JACC) that will be based in Perth to coordinate the Australian Government's support for the search into MH370.
A former Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Houston is an individual of enormous experience and great skill who has already served his country with distinction.
Australia is providing extensive logistical and other support to the Government of Malaysia in the investigation into MH370.
The new JACC will work with key Commonwealth, state and international stakeholders including the families, friends and international media.
The JACC will provide a single contact point for families to gain up-to-date information and travel assistance including visa services, accommodation advice, interpreter services and counselling.
