When Bad Things Happen To Planes, Flight Codes Get 'Retired'toggle caption Carlos Osorio/APMalaysia Airlines announced Thursday that it will stop using two flight numbers associated with the plane that disappeared over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8, following a long-standing practice of retiring codes after similar incidents.
