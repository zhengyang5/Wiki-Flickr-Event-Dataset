Relatives of Chinese passengers on board Flight MH370 scuffled with security personnel as they descended on Malaysia's embassy in a rare protest, weeping as they demanded answers on the crashed plane.
The Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines have been criticised on social media platforms, especially in China, over the lack of physical evidence to support the Prime Minister Najib Razak's somber announcement.
A Malaysia Airlines spokeswoman denied the texting had been insensitive, saying counsellors had been with relatives gathered at hotels in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing to offer support.
"My son, my son, return my son!"
China has demanded that Kuala Lumpur hand over the satellite data which led it to conclude that the Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines flight crashed at sea and that none of the people on board survived.
