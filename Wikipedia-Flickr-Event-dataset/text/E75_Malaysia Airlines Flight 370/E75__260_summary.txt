The ICAO Council adopted new provisions aimed at preventing the loss of commercial aircraft experiencing distress in remote locations.
ICAO announced new amendments to Annex 6 to the Chicago Convention (Operation of Aircraft) which will take effect between now and 2021.
They relate primarily to:The requirement for aircraft to carry autonomous distress tracking devices which can autonomously transmit location information at least once every minute in distress circumstances.
The requirement for aircraft to be equipped with a means to have flight recorder data recovered and made available in a timely manner.
