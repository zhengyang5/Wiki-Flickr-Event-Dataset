Despite the largest and most expensive underwater search in history, the plane’s location has remained a mystery.
On Tuesday, the agency that coordinated the underwater search, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), released its final report into MH370’s disappearance.
The report gives significant detail on the search but offers little in the way of new evidence about the plane’s location.
The suspension followed an unsuccessful underwater search 2,800km off the coast of Western Australia, which used an AU$160m deep-sea sonar search over 120,000sq km (46,000 sq miles).
The ATSB report said that meant the understanding of MH370’s location “is better now than it has ever been”.
