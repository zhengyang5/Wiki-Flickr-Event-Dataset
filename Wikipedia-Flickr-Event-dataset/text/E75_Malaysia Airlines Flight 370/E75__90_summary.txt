“The complexities surrounding the search cannot be understated,” the Transport Safety Bureau said in a recent search update.
They hope the next phase of the search, using side-scan sonar, synthetic aperture sonar, multibeam echo sounders and video cameras, will detect the plane’s wreckage on the seafloor.
The first phase of the search, an air and water-surface search that involved hundreds of surveillance flights covering about 1.7 million square miles, lasted 52 days.
Searchers then used towed and autonomous listening devices in the hope of detecting “pings” from the plane’s data recorders.
The new phase of the search involves towing sonar equipment that can detect wreckage miles underwater, but that search will be slow given the terrain.
