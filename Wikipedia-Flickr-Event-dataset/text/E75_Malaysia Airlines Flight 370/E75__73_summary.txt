Indian authorities said the country is still searching the areas Malaysia had instructed it to scan for the missing Boeing 777.
“We are ending our operations in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets, we are working with all relevant data including radar,” Mr. Razak said.
Because the search area now involved many countries, the relevant nations had been asked to attend a meeting at the Malaysian Foreign Ministry, he added.
India joined the search for the missing jet this week after a request from the Malaysian authorities.
