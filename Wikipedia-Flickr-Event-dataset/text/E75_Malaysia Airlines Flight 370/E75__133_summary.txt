Australian ship Ocean Shield is first investigating a possible third signal elsewhere in the massive search zone.
None has been confirmed as coming from the flight recorders of MH370.
However he said these signals were "fleeting encounters" that could not be verified until the arrival of British naval ship HMS Echo and Australian defence vessel Ocean Shield.
The signal reportedly had a frequency of 37.5kHz - the same as that emitted by the flight recorders.
Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March.
