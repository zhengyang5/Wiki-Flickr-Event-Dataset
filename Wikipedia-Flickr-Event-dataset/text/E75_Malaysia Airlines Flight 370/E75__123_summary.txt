The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) concluded that two items of debris found on the Mozambique coast were almost certainly from Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, the Boeing 777 aircraft, registered 9M-MRO that went missing on March 8, 2014.
On 27 December 2015 and 27 February 2016, two items of debris were independently found, approximately 220km apart, on the Mozambique coast.
Both items were investigated by the ATSB to determine the origin.
All measurable dimensions, materials, construction and other identifiable features conformed to the applicable Boeing drawings for the identified fairing.
