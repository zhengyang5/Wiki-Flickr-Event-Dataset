The last words spoken by one of the pilots of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane to the control tower were "Good night Malaysian three seven zero", Malaysia's civil aviation authority said, changing its previous account of the last message as being a more casual "All right, good night".
Malaysia's ambassador to China told Chinese families in Beijing as early as March 12, four days after the flight went missing, that the last words had been "All right, good night."
"Good night Malaysian three seven zero" would be a more formal, standard sign-off from the cockpit of the Boeing 777, which was just leaving Malaysia-controlled airspace on its route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
The statement said authorities were still conducting a "forensic investigation" to determine whether the last words from the cockpit were by the pilot or the co-pilot.
Previously, Malaysia Airlines said the words were believed to have come from the co-pilot.
