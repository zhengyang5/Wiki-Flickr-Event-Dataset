There are actually two boxes - a cockpit voice recorder and a data recorder.
But it's not that simple even if the black box is found.
US firm Honeywell Aerospace says the black box on the missing airliner - which it provided - only retains two hours of recording.
On the other hand, Steve Buzdygan, a former BA 777 pilot, says the data recorder would provide a wealth of useful information.
