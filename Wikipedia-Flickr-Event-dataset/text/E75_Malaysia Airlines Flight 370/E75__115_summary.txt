A tattered suitcase also washed ashore today near where the airplane debris was found, according to a newspaper in Reunion Island.
"The families who have been involved with this long, long, long, long wait, for them to have some degree of closure would be great comfort."
The debris appeared to be from the same plane as MH370, a Boeing 777, a source familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Malaysian authorities said a team was headed to Reunion Island to determine whether the debris belonged to MH370.
