Investigators traced the fire aboard a UPS plane, which crashed in Dubai on Sept. 3, 2010, to lithium batteries in the cargo.
The crash highlighted the risks of lithium batteries, which are being investigated in more recent incidents.
Lithium batteries are allowed on cargo planes, but they face some restrictions in the cargo of passenger planes.
The president of the Independent Pilots Association, the union representing UPS pilots, encouraged the FAA and UPS to quickly implement technology for suppressing and containing fires.
"As UPS pilots, we are determined to do everything in our power to minimize the risk associated with on-board smoke and fire events."
