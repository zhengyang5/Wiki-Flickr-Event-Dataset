Australia's scientific agency says it believes with "unprecedented precision and certainty" that a missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft crashed into the sea northeast of an area scoured in a fruitless two-year search.
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's assertion on Wednesday is based on satellite pictures taken two weeks after Flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014.
The CSIRO has previously raised doubts about the main 120,000-sq-km underwater search zone, saying it believed the plane went down to the north of it.
"We think it is possible to identify a most-likely location of the aircraft, with unprecedented precision and certainty," the CSIRO said.
Relatives of passengers aboard the missing flight have called on Malaysia to accept the offer.
