MH370’s ACARS system was switched off at 1.21am on March 8, two minutes after the pilots’ last verbal communication with the ground.
Even then, it would be another three days before the Malaysians shared the information with the passengers’ families and the public.
And while international experts would normally be told within 24 hours about ACARS data the Malaysians withheld it for several days.
The most likely explanation for the delays appears to be distrust between Malaysia and the other countries involved in the search operation.
On March 19, Malaysia Airlines told SITA to use the AAIB as the main analyst of the Inmarsat data.
