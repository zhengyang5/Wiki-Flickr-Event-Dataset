The United Nations aviation agency will propose a new standard that requires commercial aircraft to report their position every 15 minutes as part of a global tracking initiative in the aftermath of the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner.
Airline industry group International Air Transport Association (IATA) promised to lead an industry task force last year on the issue and to voluntarily improve tracking while ICAO developed its standard.
In December, that industry task force recommended that airlines start tracking planes in at least 15 minute intervals within 12 months, but IATA itself balked, saying the deadline was not practical.
ICAO spokesman Anthony Philbin called the ICAO scheme a "foundational flight tracking standard."
ICAO could effectively force airlines to act because the standards it sets typically become regulatory requirements in its 191 member states.
