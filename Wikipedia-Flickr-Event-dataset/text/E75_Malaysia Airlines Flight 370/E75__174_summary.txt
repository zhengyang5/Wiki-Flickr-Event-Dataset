with disastrous consequencesUnited Airlines has become the second major US airline to announce it will no longer carry bulk shipments of lithium-ion batteries.
In its tests, the FAA filled a cargo container with 5,000 lithium-ion batteries and a cartridge heater, which was added to simulate a single battery overheating.
In the subsequent investigation, the FAA highlighted the fact that a large quantity of lithium-ion batteries had been on board.
And back in 2006, a UPS cargo plane made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport, following a fire.
The UN banned shipments of these batteries on passenger planes last year, and the ban came into effect in January.
