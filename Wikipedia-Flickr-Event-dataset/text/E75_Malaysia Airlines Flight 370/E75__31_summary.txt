PETALING JAYA: Whether it is a local or international mission, going off at a momentâ€™s notice is normal for a Taiwan Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation Malaysian volunteer.
It was just passed noon on March 8 when news that flight MH370 had gone missing.
Immediately, Tzu Chi started assembling a group of volunteers to board a special flight to Beijing later that day, at 5.30pm.
Last weekend, Tzu Chi sent a second batch of volunteers to Beijing for the same purpose.
A memorandum of understanding on emergency response support services was signed by Tzu Chi and Malaysia Airlines in 2007, enabling Tzu Chi to provide support for family members of victims in times of crisis.
