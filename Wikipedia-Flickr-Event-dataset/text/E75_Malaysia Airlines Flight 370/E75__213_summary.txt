Khazanah, which owns 69.37 percent of MAS, said it would will take six to 12 months to complete its restructuring of MAS after it has secured approval from shareholders.
Khazanah said it will need cooperation from all parties to undertake the restructuring, covering the airline's operations, business model, finances, staff and the regulatory environment.
The incident sped up efforts for the government to restructure the airline, sources said.
"This is the sensible way forward given that massive surgery is required," said Christopher Wong, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia.
Hampered by strong trade union resistance to any restructuring, MAS has struggled to cut costs and improve productivity.
