French authorities said Friday that a week-long operation had begun on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion to search for debris from Flight MH370 after part of a Boeing 777 wing was found on the island last week.
Bad weather forced the suspension of operations on Friday evening with the search set to begin again on Sunday morning.
"It is with a very heavy heart that I must tell you that an international team of experts has conclusively confirmed that the aircraft debris found on Reunion island is indeed from MH370," Najib said earlier Thursday.
The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8 last year, inexplicably veering off course en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
Sara Weeks, the sister of MH370 passenger Paul Weeks of New Zealand, said the confirmation ended "a week of turmoil".
