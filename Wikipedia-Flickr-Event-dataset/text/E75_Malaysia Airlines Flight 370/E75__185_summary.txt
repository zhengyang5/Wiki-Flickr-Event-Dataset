Around 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems was also shut down.
The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane’s disappearance was deliberate.
On Sunday, Malaysian Defense Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit — “All right, good night” — were spoken to air traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off.
Malaysian police were also investigating engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.
The last “ping” was sent out at 8:11 a.m. — 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off.
