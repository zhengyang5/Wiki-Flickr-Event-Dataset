MH370 and the Secrets of the Deep, Dark Southern Indian OceanIn 1900, Jules Verne published The Castaway of the Flag, an adventure novel in the shipwreck fantasy subgenre.
The southern Indian Ocean is not only remote, but it has worse weather than just about any other place on the planet.
That these are some of the deepest parts of the Indian Ocean, with a rugged and volcanic ocean floor, decreases the likelihood that the black boxes would be retrievable.
The mystery of Flight 370 will be added to the slim corpus of stories set in the southern Indian Ocean.
Until it gives up the answer, the southern Indian Ocean remains part of the mystery.
