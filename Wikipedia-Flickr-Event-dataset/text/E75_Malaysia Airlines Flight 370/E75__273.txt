Tonight at 9 pm Eastern time, NOVA presents a documentary by Emmy Award winning producer and journalist Miles O’Brien exploring how the Malaysia Airlines flight 370 could have vanished on what should have been a routine red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. The documentary can be viewed on PBS stations.

The documentary details what we know occurred on that fateful flight, examines in depth what could have happened but most likely did not happen and explores what may have in fact occurred. Mr. O’Brien, a long-time aviation reporter and pilot, does an outstanding job of producing a film for aviation enthusiasts of all levels of aeronautical knowledge. He does a particularly good job of explaining highly technical information on airline systems, radar and the now-famous Immarsat satellites to a general audience.

The documentary interviews a number of aviation experts (full disclosure, I am interviewed in the show) including two long-time Boeing 777 pilots, a former FAA radar engineer, David Gallo, the oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute who was instrumental in searching and finding Air France Flight 447 and the Immarsat engineers who performed never-before-done analyses of data from their satellites.

Why Planes Vanish should be viewed by all aviation regulators and policy makers around the world. As is clear from the documentary, there is much that can and should be done to prevent an airliner from ever vanishing again. As Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General for the US Department of Transportation, states in the film there is no reason to wait for some of these changes for the missing flight to be found.
