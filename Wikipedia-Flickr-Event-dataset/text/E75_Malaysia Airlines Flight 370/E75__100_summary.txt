MH370 vanished three years ago somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people aboard.
Liow was commenting on media reports from Australia that said Malaysia could resume the search as early as this week.
Australia, Malaysia and China called off a A$200m ($159.16m), two-year search for the plane in January, amid protests from families of those onboard.
Liow said the proposals would eventually be presented to the other countries in the tripartite committee – China and Australia – before a decision was taken.
Representatives for Ocean Infinity have said the company would only want to be paid if the aircraft was found.
