Police are investigating whether the food served on board the missing Malaysian airliner was poisoned.
They are also retracing every piece of cargo that was loaded on to the Boeing 777, including tonnes of mangosteens, a tropical Asian fruit with a leathery shell surrounding fragrant white flesh.
The search for the missing plane continues off the coast of Perth.

Inspector-General Khalid said every possible angle had to be investigated to rule out sabotage.
