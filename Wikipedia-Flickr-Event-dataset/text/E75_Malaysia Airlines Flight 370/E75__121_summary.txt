But whether the debris can provide any clues into exactly what happened to the aircraft and why is uncertain.
One of the parts in Mozambique was discovered by American lawyer and part-time adventurer Blaine Gibson, of Seattle.
If approved, a Malaysian team will be sent to conduct the search along the coast of South Africa and Mozambique, Liow said.
