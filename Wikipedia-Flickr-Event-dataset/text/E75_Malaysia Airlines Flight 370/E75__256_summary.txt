TORONTO (Reuters) - An airline industry-led task force looking at ways to improve plane tracking after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines’ flight MH370 has delayed its recommendations, possibly until December.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in May called for the body to adopt real-time tracking of civilian aircraft and other measures.
In May, members of the U.N.’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) governing council agreed on the need for global tracking.
IATA was to put together tracking proposals that its members would implement voluntarily before ICAO set industry standards, which can take several years.
Airline industry leaders have said keeping track of their aircraft in real time could push up ticket prices for passengers.
