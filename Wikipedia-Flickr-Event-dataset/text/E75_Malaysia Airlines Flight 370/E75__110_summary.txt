The search, which is concentrated on the South China Sea area, intensifies after images of objects floating in the water are picked by a satellite.
After examination of 'pings' picked up by satellite for four hours after the plane vanished, the investigation re-focuses on a new potential search area in the Indian Ocean.
The signals indicate the plane was capable of communication, but the data would be unlikely to include a precise location.
Satellite imagery reveals possible debris, approximately 2,500km south west of Perth, western Australia.
More possible debris is picked up by Chinese satellites - an object is spotted about 120km south of where an Australian satellite captured similar images two days earlier.
