'INTERFERENCE': Pilot in another plane was flying 30 minutes ahead of MH370SEPANG: A BOEING 777 pilot, who was flying 30 minutes ahead of the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft, said he established contact with MH370 minutes after he was asked to do so by Vietnamese air traffic control.
"We managed to establish contact with MH370 just after 1.30am and asked them if they have transferred into Vietnamese airspace.
He said he thought nothing of it, as the occurrence (of losing contact) was normal, until it was established that MH370 never landed.
For Fariq's brother, Afiq, the bond they had was beyond sharing a last name.
The chemical engineering student, from Universiti Teknologi Petronas, had earlier tweeted: "Pray for my brother #MH370."
