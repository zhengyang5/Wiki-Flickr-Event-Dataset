A+ A-MH370 When any unidentified aircraft flies over the country, the natural reaction is to scramble jets to intercept the possible threat.
In fact, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 flew westwards after making a turn back over the Gulf of Thailand, undetected by the military, across Peninsular Malaysia and the countryâ€™s second largest city in Penang, according to a report by the New York Times .
This failure was not only a breach in air space security, which would make Malaysia vulnerable to attacks, but it also meant the country lost a precious opportunity to intercept Flight MH370 which had then flown into the vast unknown.
The new locations were established based on military radar data and satellite pings which MH370 had automatically sent despite its communication systems being mysteriously turned off, on purpose.
As the loss of MH370 enters the 10th day today, the new search area includes vast tracks of lands across 11 countries and remote parts of the Indian Ocean.
