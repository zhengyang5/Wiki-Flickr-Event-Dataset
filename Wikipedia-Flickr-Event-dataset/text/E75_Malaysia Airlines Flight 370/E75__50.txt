MH370 Flight Incident

Monday, March 17, 05:40 PM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - MH370 Press Briefing by Hishammuddin Hussein, Minister of Defence and Acting Minister of Transport

Introductory statement Before answering your questions I would like to give a brief statement, starting with an operational update. 1. Diplomatic efforts During the last 24 hours, the Prime Minister has spoken to the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of China. Malaysia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent diplomatic notes to all countries involved in the search and rescue operation. This includes two groups: first, countries in the search corridors; and second, countries from which we are seeking assistance and expertise. For countries in the search corridors, we are requesting radar and satellite information, as well as specific assets for the search and rescue operation. We are asking them to share their land, sea and aerial search and rescue action plans with the Rescue Co-ordination Centre here in Malaysia, so that we can co-ordinate the search effort. We have asked for regular updates, including daily reports on both search activities, and details of any information required from Malaysia. We are not at liberty to reveal information from specific countries. As the co-ordinating authority we are gathering all information as part of the on-going search and rescue operation. 2. Search and rescue operations Over the past 48 hours, Malaysia has been working on the diplomatic, technical and logistical requirements of the search for MH370. The number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation has increased to 26. Malaysia continues to lead the overall co-ordination of the search effort. The southern corridor has been divided into two sections, according to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) demarcations. These demarcations were agreed by the ICAO – of which Malaysia is a council member – before MH370 went missing. Australia and Indonesia have agreed to lead search and rescue operations in their respective regions as demarcated by the ICAO. Today, I can confirm that search and rescue operations in the northern and southern corridors have already begun. Countries including Malaysia, Australia, China, Indonesia and Kazakhstan have already initiated search and rescue operations. The Royal Malaysian Air Force and the Royal Malaysian Navy have deployed assets to the southern corridor. Two Malaysian ships have been deployed: the offshore patrol vessels KD Kelantan and KD Selangor. This deployment also includes a Super Lynx helicopter, which can operate from either ship. Australia has already moved a P-3 Orion aircraft to region of the Cocos and Christmas Islands. Today, the Prime Minister of Australia confirmed that Australia will send an additional two P-3 Orions and a C-130 Hercules. A US P-8 Poseidon aircraft will be travelling to Perth today to help with the search. 3. Expert involvement Malaysia has been working with international investigators and aviation authorities since day one. Yesterday, experts from Civil Aviation Administration of China joined the investigations team. Today, officials from the French Office of Investigations and Analysis for the Safety of Civil Aviation also joined the team. These authorities are working with Malaysia Airlines and the DCA to refine data that can help with the search. 4. Police investigation On Saturday 8 March, the Royal Malaysia Police started investigations into all crew members on board MH370, including the pilot and co-pilot, as well as all ground staff handling the aircraft. On Sunday 9 March, police officers visited the homes of the pilot and co-pilot. Officers also spoke to family members of the pilot and co-pilot. Police visited the homes of the pilot and co-pilot again on Saturday 15 March. The pilot’s flight simulator was taken from his house with the assistance of his family. The simulator was re-assembled at police headquarters. At this point, I would like to stress that Malaysia has been co-operating with the FBI, Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities since day one. 5. Malaysia’s response I would also like to address the speculation that Malaysia has held back information about MH370’s movements. For the families, I understand that every day prolongs the anguish. I understand because Malaysia, too, is missing its sons and daughters. There were 50 Malaysians on board the plane. Our priority has always been to find the aircraft. We would not withhold any information that could help. But we also have a responsibility not to release information until it has been verified by the international investigations team. This responsibility is not only to the families and to the investigation, but also the search and rescue operation. It would be irresponsible to deploy substantial assets merely on the basis of unverified and uncorroborated information. As soon as the possibility emerged that the plane had carried out an air turn back to the Straits of Malacca, we expanded our search to that area. I would like to reiterate the US investigating team’s statement about that decision: based on the information and data given by the Malaysian authorities, the US team was of the view that there were reasonable grounds for the Malaysian authorities to deploy resources to conduct search on the western side of peninsular Malaysia. As soon as we verified and corroborated the new satellite information as to the possible last known whereabouts of the aircraft, we recalibrated our search efforts to the northern and southern corridors as announced by the Prime Minister. After my statement we will release a more detailed map of the northern and southern corridors. 6. Malaysia Airlines Malaysia Airlines has set up operations centres in both Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, to care for the families of the crew members and passengers. MAS has allocated each family a caregiver, who will be on 24hours duty. They have sent more than 100 staff and caregivers to Beijing. The airline gives daily briefings to the families. They provide counselling sessions. And they contact families that have elected not to come to Malaysia between two and three times a day. 7. Concluding remarks Over the past two days, we have been recalibrating the search for MH370. It remains a significant diplomatic, technical and logistical challenge. Malaysia is encouraged by the progress made during such a short period of time. We are grateful for the response by the heads of government that we have spoken to, all of whom have expressed a commitment of assistance. With support from our many international partners, this new phase of the search is underway. Assets are being deployed, and search and rescue operations have begun. I wish to thank our partners from around the world for their continued support.

马来西亚航空公司MH370航空事件 新闻发布会 2014年03月17日 引言： 在回答各位的提问之前，我首先向大家介绍搜救工作的最新进展： 1.外交努力 在过去的24小时中，马来西亚总理与中国总理和澳大利亚首相进行了沟通。马来西亚外交部已将相关外交文件发给了参与搜查与营救的各个国家。 这些参与搜救的国家分为两组：第一，搜索走廊相关的国家；第二，马来西亚寻求专业知识协助的国家。 对于搜索走廊相关的国家，我们请求雷达以及卫星信号方面的信息，同时也包括其他对搜救有利的各种资源。我们请求这些国家与马来西亚救援指挥中心分享他们获取的地面、海洋以及空中搜救行动计划，以便我们能够协调搜救工作。我们已向他们要求规范的提供更新信息，包括每日搜救报告以及马来西亚要求的任何信息详情。 2.搜救措施 在过去48小时中，马来西亚在外交、技术以及后勤方面总协调MH370的搜救工作。参与搜救工作的国家增长到了26个。 马来西亚将继续是此次搜救工作的总体协调方。而根据国际民航组织的划分标准，南部走廊可被分为两个区域。 这样的区域划分在MH370飞机失联前已经得到国际民航组织的认同。马来西亚是国际民航组织委员会的一员。澳大利亚和印度尼西亚两国已经同意在国际民航组织划分的各自区域内带头进行搜救。 在这里，我可以确认我们在南北走廊的搜救工作已经展开。 马来西亚、澳大利亚、中国、印度尼西亚以及哈萨克斯坦已经开始了搜救工作。 马来西亚皇家空军以及马来西亚皇家海军已经向南部走廊部署了搜救力量，包括两艘马来西亚军舰：近海巡逻舰KD KELANTAN以及KD Selangor, 同时还包括一架超级山猫（SuperLynx）直升飞机，该飞机可以在两艘巡逻舰上进行飞行操作。 3.专业力量参与搜救 从搜救工作开始的第一天，马来西亚便与国际调查员以及航空领域的权威专家保持着紧密的合作。 昨天，来自中国民用航空总局的专家也加入了调查小组。 今天，来自法国民航安全调查分析局的官员也加入到了搜救小组。这些权威机构与马来西亚航空公司以及马来西亚民航局共同工作，提炼并分析对搜救工作有帮助的数据。 4.警方调查 3月8日星期六，马来西亚皇家警察即开始了包括机长以及副机长在内的MH370机组成员的调查工作，同时还包括涉及该飞机此次飞行的所有地勤人员。 3月9日星期日，警方前往了机长以及副机长的住所，同时与他们的家人进行了沟通。 3月15星期六，警方再次前往机长与副机长的住所。机长的飞行模拟器已经在其家人的协助下带走并重新安装放在警察总局。 在这里，我想再次强调，马来西亚从搜救工作展开的第一天开始，便与美国联邦调查局、国际刑事警察组织以及其他相关国际执法当局紧密合作。 5.马方回应 在这里，我就马来西亚没有揭露MH370航班行动信息这一猜测做出相关回应。 对于机上乘客的亲属们，我理解每一天的等待都是你们痛苦的延长。我能够深刻的理解，是因为失联飞机上有50名乘客，也是马来西亚的子女。 我们搜救的首要任务一直都是寻找失联的飞机。我们不会隐瞒任何有助于搜救的信息。但是我们也有义务保证，在国际调查小组没有证实的情况下，不擅自发布信息。 这一义务不仅仅是保护失联乘客的亲属以及事件的调查，同时也是为了保障搜救工作的有序进行。在信息没有得到验证与核实的情况下就去部署大量的资源，是不负责任的表现。 当失联飞机有掉头飞往马六甲海峡的可能性被提出之后，我们便将搜索范围扩大到了这一区域。在这里，我想重申美国调查小组针对这一决定做出的声明：根据马来西亚当局提供的信息及数据，美国搜救小组认为马来西亚当局有合理理由部署资源前往马来半岛西侧海域进行搜索。 当我们核实了最新卫星信息，确定失联飞机可能的最终失联地点之后，我们重新部署了搜救力量前往马来西亚首相所公布南部和北部走廊。在我的讲话之后，我们将会发布一张更加详细的南部和北部走廊的地图。 6.马来西亚航空公司 马来西亚航空公司在吉隆坡与北京分别设立了行动中心，以照顾失联乘客以及机组人员的家属。 马来西亚航空公司为每位失联乘客家庭配备一名24小时服务的护理人员，同时马来西亚航空公司已经派遣超过100名员工及护理员前往北京。 马来西亚航空公司每日为失联者家属提供沟通会，告知家属最新的搜救情况。同时针对那些没有前往马来西亚的家属，马来西亚航空公司每天会与他们进行两到三次的电话沟通。 7.结语 在过去两天中，我们重新部署了MH370航班的搜救工作。此次搜救工作仍然是对外交、技术以及后勤三方面的严峻考验。能在这么短的时间取得进步，马来西亚深受鼓舞。同时，我们也十分感激与我们沟通的各国政府首脑，他们都承诺将协助搜救行动。 在许多国际合作伙伴的支持下，新的搜救阶段正在展开。我们部署了新的资源，开始了新的搜救工作。在此，我诚挚的感谢来自全世界各地的合作伙伴一如既往的支持。

Sunday, March 16, 05:30 PM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - MH370 Press Briefing by Hishammuddin Hussein, Minister of Defence and Acting Minister of Transport

I know many of you have submitted questions, and I will try to answer some of those questions in my statement today. Every day brings new angles, especially as we are refocusing and expanding the search area – and as always, we have a responsibility to release only information that has been corroborated and verified. The airline has deployed a team of 94 caregivers consisting of well-trained staff and also Tzu Chi Foundation members to provide emotional support to the families. The airline will also be deploying another set of caregivers to Beijing later today. We cannot respond to every request immediately, so I ask you to bear with us. 1. Search area As the Prime Minister said yesterday, the operation has entered a new phase. The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort. It has now become even more difficult. The search area has been significantly expanded. And the nature of the search has changed. From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans. The number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation has increased from 14 to 25, which brings new challenges of co-ordination and diplomacy to the search effort. This is a significant recalibration of the search. The search and rescue operation continues to be a multi-national effort, one led and co-ordinated by Malaysia. In the last 24 hours, the Prime Minister has spoken to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the President of Turkmenistan, the President of Kazakhstan and Prime Minister of India. Yesterday the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia briefed representatives from countries along the northern and southern corridors. At 2pm today, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia briefed representatives from 22 countries, including those along the northern and southern search corridors, as well other countries that may be able to help. These include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia. Malaysian officials are requesting support from these countries – as well as others. This support includes general satellite data, radar playback – both primary and secondary – provisions for ground, sea and aerial search, and assets as appropriate. We are currently discussing with all partners how best to deploy assets along the two search corridors. At this stage, both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance. We are asking countries that have satellite assets, including the US, China and France amongst others, to provide further satellite data. And we are contacting additional countries who may be able to contribute specific assets relevant to the search and rescue operation. Surveillance aircraft are required, and maritime vessels are needed, particularly for the southern corridor. 2. Police investigation As the Prime Minister said yesterday, up until the time the aircraft left military primary radar coverage, its movements were consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane. I cannot comment on speculative theories as to what might have caused the deviation from the original flight path, as I do not wish to prejudice the on-going investigation. I understand the hunger for new details. But we do not want to jump to conclusions. Out of respect to the families, and the process itself, we must wait for the investigation to run its course. The Malaysian authorities are refocusing their investigation on all crew and passengers on board MH370, as well as all ground staff handling the aircraft. Yesterday, officers from the Royal Malaysia Police visited the home of the pilot. They spoke to family members of the pilot and experts are examining the pilot’s flight simulator. The police also visited the home of the co-pilot. According to Malaysia Airlines, the pilot and co-pilot did not ask to fly together on MH370. I would like to stress that Malaysia has been working with international law enforcement agencies since day one. 3. Aircraft maintenance Malaysia Airlines has confirmed that the aircraft was subjected to the required maintenance program: the Boeing Maintenance Planning Document. Checks are done according to this program. The aircraft had been fully serviced and was fit to fly. 4. New involvement The Inmarsat team arrived yesterday and will support the investigations team, which includes the Malaysian authorities, and the UK and US teams. 5. Concluding remarks I would like to conclude by reiterating that the search for MH370 has entered a new phase. The information released yesterday has provided new leads, and given new direction to the search process. We will provide more detail on the redeployment of assets when it becomes available. Facts must be corroborated and verified before being released. When possible, we will keep the media fully briefed, but our priority remains the search and rescue operation. To that end, we have been engaged in diplomatic and investigative efforts over the past 24 hours.

Saturday, March 15, 05:45 PM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 19th Media Statement

Further to the statement by the Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak earlier today into the ongoing search for Flight MH370, Malaysia Airlines has shared all available information with the relevant authorities since the moment we learned that the aircraft had disappeared, in the early hours of Saturday 8th March. This includes the very first indications that MH370 may have remained airborne for several hours after contact was lost, which the Prime Minister referred to today. This is truly an unprecedented situation, for Malaysia Airlines and for the entire aviation industry. There has never been a case in which information gleaned from satellite signals alone could potentially be used to identify the location of a missing commercial airliner. Given the nature of the situation and its extreme sensitivity, it was critical that the raw satellite signals were verified and analysed by the relevant authorities so that their significance could be properly understood. This naturally took some time, during which we were unable to publicly confirm their existence. We were well aware of the ongoing media speculation during this period, and its effect on the families of those on board. Their anguish and distress increases with each passing day, with each fresh rumour, and with each false or misleading media report. Our absolute priority at all times has been to support the authorities leading the multinational search for MH370, so that we can finally provide the answers which the families and the wider community are waiting for. We remain absolutely committed to sharing confirmed information with family members and the wider public in a fully open and transparent manner. However given the nature of the situation, the importance of validating new information before it is released into the public domain is paramount. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families of the 227 passengers and our 12 Malaysia Airlines colleagues and friends on board flight MH370. They will remain at the centre of every action we take as a company, as they have been since MH370 first disappeared.

马来西亚航空公司MH370航空事件 媒体声明19 (2014年3月15日下午5时55分发布) 关于马来西亚首相拿督斯里纳吉敦拉萨今天较早时对于正在搜寻马来西亚航空公司MH370航班的工作所发表的声明， 马来西亚航空公司自获悉该班机于3 月8 日凌晨失踪后，便与各有关当局互通得到的一切信息。 这包括首相今天所提及的最初显示MH370 航班可能在失去联络后继续在空中飞行数小时迹象的信息。 原始的卫星讯号必须由有关当局加以核实和分析，以充分地了解这些讯号的意义。由于核实和分析工作需要一些时间，因此我们在此期间无法公开证实这些讯号的存在。 我们很清楚在此期间，媒体持续所作的各种猜测， 以及这些猜测对航班上乘客家属的影响。随着失联时间的增加以及不断出现的谣言、虚假或误导性的报导，都会加深他们的痛苦和忧伤。我们的当务之急是协助有关当局组织多国搜寻MH370航班 ， 以便我们可以最终为家属们及公众提供他们所期待的答案。 我们绝对承诺以完全透明的方式向家属及公众公开已被证实的信息。然而，鉴于事态的性质，我们向公众发布任何新信息之前必须先核实信息的真实性。 我们继续与MH370 航班上227 名乘客及12 位马航同事的家属一起祈祷。MH370航班失联以来，他们便是马航的工作重心。

Friday, March 14, 12:13 PM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 18th Media Statement

Malaysia Airlines will continue to provide regular updates to the general public via the media and our website on all matters affecting MH370.

马来西亚航空公司MH370航空事件 媒体声明十八 （2014年3月14日下午12时13分发布） 马来西亚航空公司再次郑重声明，公司将继续与马来西亚民航局紧密合作，全力支持该局在马来西亚交通部权限范围下所进行的搜索和救援任务。 对于各方媒体持续不断的各种猜测，马来西亚航空重声我们已将所掌握的一切信息全面地提供与发表，故暂无补充。 马航此时的首要任务乃尽全力关注及照顾MH370航班的乘客与机组人员的家属，为他们提供及时信息、安排交通、食宿、医疗服务及心灵关怀辅导。 马来西亚航空将继续通过媒体及网站向公众发布所有关于MH370事件的最新消息。 媒体咨询请联络+603 8777 5698 / +603 8787 1276。

Thursday, March 13, 11:10 AM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 17th Media Statement

As a mark of respect to the passengers and crew of MH370 on 8 March 2014, the MH370 and MH371 flight codes will be retired from the Malaysia Airlines’ Kuala Lumpur- Beijing-Kuala Lumpur route. With effect from 14 March 2014, the new flight number to replace MH370 and MH371 will be:- MH 318 – Kuala Lumpur - Beijing MH 319 – Beijing - Kuala Lumpur There are no changes to the frequency of our services and we will continue to operate double daily services to Beijing. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families of our colleagues and passengers of MH 370.

Thursday, March 13, 12:45 AM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 16th Media Statement

Malaysia Airlines wishes to clarify the claims that some families of the passengers were flown to India instead of Malaysia. This is not true. Malaysia Airlines flies directly from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur without a transit. There are also no Malaysia Airlines' direct flights from Hong Kong to Mumbai or any part of India. The welfare of both the crew and passenger’s families remain our focus. At the same time, the security and safety of our passengers is of the utmost importance to us.

Wednesday, March 12, 11:30 PM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 15th Media Statement

Similar to the situation in Kuala Lumpur, the focus of Malaysia Airlines team in Beijing is to provide care for the families of passengers. Malaysia Airlines has to-date deployed a team of 112 caregivers to provide assistance to the family members during this trying time. Once the news of the incident became known, a total of 94 caregivers including the Senior Management members of Malaysia Airlines were deployed to Beijing immediately. In the days that followed, an additional 18 caregivers were deployed. The caregiver’s primary role is to provide family members with emotional support and ensure their basic needs are met to try and make this difficult time relatively bearable. Malaysia Airlines also provided equal amount of initial financial assistance to all families of passengers, over and above meeting their basic needs. All travel arrangements, accommodation, meals, and medical support are also absorbed by the Airline. Regular briefings are conducted to update the families on current progress. During these briefings, the team also takes questions from the families to clear any doubt that they may have. We have arranged a team of translators to convey our messages in Mandarin. We also continue to keep the Chinese media informed and updated via regular press conferences. Malaysia Airlines also received support from the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia (DCAM), who deployed two of their officers to join the team in Beijing. This was to facilitate questions and provide information on the search and rescue mission which is coordinated by the DCAM. The Airline continues to work closely with the authorities and we appreciate the help we are receiving from all local and international agencies during this critical period. Our top priority remains to provide any and all assistance to the families of the passengers and crew. Malaysia Airlines reiterates that it continues to be transparent in communicating with the general public via the media on all matters affecting MH370.

Wednesday, March 12, 01:00 PM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 14th Media Statement

Malaysia Airlines' primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families of the passengers and crew of MH370. This means providing them with timely information, travel facilities, accommodation, meals, medical and emotional support. All these costs are borne by Malaysia Airlines. We have deployed teams of caregivers consisting of trained MAS staff and volunteers from Mercy Malaysia and Tzu Chi Foundation. These caregivers are stationed at five different locations at Beijing and four different locations in Kuala Lumpur. As of now, we have 115 family members in Kuala Lumpur and they are taken care of by 72 different caregivers. At least one caregiver is assigned to each family together with a Mandarin translator for the families from China. The caregivers have been keeping the families updated on the search and rescue efforts as well as provide emotional support. Equal amount of initial financial assistance are being given out to all families of passengers and crew over and above their basic needs. This amount is extended to families of all crew and passengers in Malaysia as well those from other nations. We regret and empathise with the families and we will do whatever we can to ease their burden. We are as anxious as the families to know the status of their loved ones.

Tuesday, March 11, 11:15 AM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 11th Media Statement

As we enter into Day 4, the aircraft is yet to be found. The search and rescue teams (SAR) have expanded the scope beyond the flight path to the West Peninsular of Malaysia at the Straits of Malacca. The authorities are looking at a possibility of an attempt made by MH370 to turn back to Subang. All angles are being looked at. We are not ruling out any possibilities. The mission is aided by various countries namely Australia, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines and the United States of America. The assets deployed to cover the search and rescue is extensive. In total there are nine aircraft and 24 vessels deployed on this mission. Apart from the search in the sea, search on land in between these areas is also conducted. The search and rescue teams have analysed debris and oil slick found in the waters. It is confirmed that it does not belong to MH370. The B777-200 aircraft that operated MH370 underwent maintenance on 23 February 2014, 12 days before this particular flight on 8 March 2014. The next check is due on 19 June 2014. The maintenance was conducted at the KLIA hangar and there were no issues on the health of the aircraft. The aircraft was delivered to Malaysia Airlines in 2002 and have since recorded 53,465.21 hours with a total of 7525 cycles. All Malaysia Airlines aircraft are equipped with continuous data monitoring system called the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) which transmits data automatically. Nevertheless, there were no distress calls and no information was relayed. Malaysia Airlines has a special task force to take care of families. Mercy Malaysia and Tzu Chi and others are also helping Malaysia Airlines by providing special psychological counseling to families and also the MH crew. The Chinese government officials in Malaysia are also working closely with Malaysia Airlines. A representative from the embassy is stationed at the Emergency Operations Centre to assist with the emergency management and matters related to families in Kuala Lumpur. In Beijing, the Prime Minister’s special envoy to China, Tan Sri Ong Ka Ting is there to assist and coordinate all operational matters with Malaysia Airlines. We regret and empathise with the families and we will do whatever we can to ensure that all basic needs, comfort, psychological support are delivered. We are as anxious as the families to know the status of their loved ones. To the families of the crew on-board MH370, we share your pain and anxiety. They are of the MAS family and we are deeply affected by this unfortunate incident. Malaysia Airlines reiterates that it will continue to be transparent in communicating with the general public via the media on all matters affecting MH370.

Monday, March 10, 05:30 PM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 10th Media Statement

The purpose of this statement is to update on emergency response activities at Malaysia Airlines. On notification of the incident the following steps have been taken:- The EOC:- 1. Activation of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in the early morning of 8 March 2014. The EOC is the central command and control facility responsible for carrying out emergency management functions at the strategic level during a disaster. 2. In addition to the EOC, various departments of Malaysia Airlines are also addressing to all the different needs during this crisis. Family Management 1. Malaysia Airlines is working closely with the government of China to expedite the issuance of passports for the families intending to travel to Malaysia, as well as with the immigration of Malaysia on the issuance of their visas into Malaysia. 2. Malaysia Airlines is deploying an additional aircraft to bring the families from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur on 11 March 2014. 3. When the aircraft is located, a Response Coordination Centre (RCC) will be established within the vicinity to support the needs of the families. This has been communicated specifically to the families. 4. Once the Response Coordination Centre is operational, we will provide transport and accommodation to the designated areas for the family members. 5. Our oneworld partners have been engaged to help bring family members in other countries aside from China into Kuala Lumpur. Search and Rescue 1. Malaysia Airlines has been actively cooperating with the search and rescue authorities coordinated by the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia (DCA) and the Ministry of Transport 2. DCA has confirmed that search and rescue teams from Australia, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines, New Zealand and the United States of America have come forward to assist. We are grateful for these efforts. We also want to address a few common queries from the media. We are receiving many queries about how the passengers with the stolen passports purchased their tickets. We are unable to comment on this matter as this is a security issue. We can however confirm that we have given all the flight details to the authorities for further investigation. We also confirm that we are making necessary arrangements for MH370 passengers' families from Beijing to travel to Kuala Lumpur. However, flight details of the families’ arrival are highly confidential. This is to protect the privacy and well-being of the families during this difficult time and to respect their space. Our position is not to reveal any information on the flight or movements of the families. Malaysia Airlines' primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families of the passengers and crew of MH370. This means providing them with timely information, travel facilities, accommodation, meals, medical and emotional support. The costs for these are all borne by Malaysia Airlines. All other Malaysia Airlines’ flights are as per schedule. The safety of our passengers and crew has always been and will continue to be of utmost importance to us. The airline continues to work with the authorities and we appreciate the help we are receiving from all local and international parties and agencies during this critical and difficult time. Malaysia Airlines reiterates that it will continue to be transparent in communicating with the general public via the media on all matters affecting MH370.

Monday, March 10, 10:00 AM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - 9th Media Statement

It has been more than 48 hours since we lost contact with our flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite not being able to establish any positive findings on the whereabouts of the aircraft, Malaysia Airlines has been actively cooperating with the search and rescue authorities coordinated by the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia (DCA). DCA has confirmed that search and rescue teams from Australia, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines and the United States of America have come forward to assist. We are grateful for these efforts. Malaysia Airlines' primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families. This means providing them with timely information, travel facilities, accommodation, meals, medical and emotional support. The costs for these are all borne by Malaysia Airlines. Initial financial assistance has been given out to all families over and above their basic needs. At least one caregiver is assigned to each family. These caregivers are well-trained staff and volunteers from Malaysia and other organisations. As of now, there are more than 150 "Go Team" members consisting of senior management and caregivers at Beijing to attend to these families. In Kuala Lumpur, a different group of caregivers are attending to the families’ needs. Families from other nations apart from China have been arriving at Kuala Lumpur since early yesterday.
