Very few details have been released by the re/insurance industry related to the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which has caused some minor confusion as to the re/insurers providing coverage for claims.
Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty has been identified as both the lead insurer and the lead reinsurer.
Malaysia’s Etiqa Insurance & Takaful, along with other local insurers, is the lead insurer covering the aircraft.
The vast majority, if not in fact all of it, was placed through the London re/insurance company market and/or Lloyd’s.
At this point further details concerning potential liability, policy limits and details, and the companies involved remain confidential.
