From the ground station log it was established that after ACARS stopped sending messages, 6 complete handshakes took place.
MH370 measured data against predicted tracksThe blue line is the burst frequency offset measured at the ground station for MH370.
The red line is the predicted burst frequency offset for the northern route, which over the last 6 handshakes does not correlate with the measured values for MH370.
Example southern tracksThis shows the southern tracks for a ground speed of 400 and 450 knots ground speed.
It should be noted that further work is required to determine the aircraft speed and final position.
