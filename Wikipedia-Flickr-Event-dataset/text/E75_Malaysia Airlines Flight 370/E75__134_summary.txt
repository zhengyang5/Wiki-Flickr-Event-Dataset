With 26 nations hovering over disputed waters and fragile security zones, the search for MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean seems like a giant game of Risk.
A United Nation's agency is in charge of multi-national search and rescue operations.
MH370's search effort, involving ships and planes from many nations, on the surface looks likes an harmonious exercise.
At stake is the effectiveness of the 70-year-old United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation, which defines the protocols of air traffic investigations.
David Newbery, an accredited accident investigator with the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Association, said while the search was "politically tricky", the ICAO framework was sufficient.
