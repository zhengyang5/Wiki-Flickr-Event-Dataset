KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia kicked off a new search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 on Monday, its civil aviation department said.
This month, the southeast Asian nation agreed to pay U.S. firm Ocean Infinity up to US$70 million if it finds the plane within 90 days.
The search vessel, the Seabed Constructor, set off from Durban, South Africa, on Jan. 3.
Australia, Malaysia and China called off their two-year search for the plane a year ago after finding nothing in a 120,000-sq-km underwater search zone.
