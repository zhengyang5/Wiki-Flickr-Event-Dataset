To prevent another MH370 from happening, tracking and control systems must change.
MH370 also carried an ADS-B, an automatic dependency system that broadcasts location information via radio frequency, was also deactivated.
Flight crews on long-haul commercial flights over oceans or desolate and remote land mass report their position using either high-frequency radio or using satellite communications.
Whoever was flying the aircraft was either unable to report its position using satellite communications or chose not to.
Otherwise, it could take years before we can really reduce the chances of a disaster like MH370 from happening again.
