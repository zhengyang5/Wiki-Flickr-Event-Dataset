Island authorities to maintain ‘air of vigilance’ after scouring of territory’s eastern coastline and 10,000 sq km of sea surface turns up no resultsFrench officials have said they are calling off the hunt for wreckage from missing flight MH370, after 10 days of air and sea searches off its Indian Ocean territory of Réunion yielded nothing.
The island’s top authority said on Monday that its search teams would maintain an attitude of vigilance.
A wing part washed up on the island on 29 July and was confirmed by the Malaysian prime minister to be part of the Boeing 777 which went missing on 8 March 2014 with 239 people on board.
The discovery raised hopes of finally solving the mystery of what happened to the plane and prompted investigators to search a maritime surface of 10,000 sq km and scour the island’s eastern coastline.
Those efforts will now come to an end after the French state’s representative on the island, Dominique Sorain, said in a statement that the searches “have not led to the identification of anything that could have a link with a plane”
