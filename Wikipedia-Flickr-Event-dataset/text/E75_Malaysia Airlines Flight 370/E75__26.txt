SHAH ALAM: The family of the co-pilot of the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) aircraft which went missing enroute to Beijing this morning, is waiting at home for news on Flight MH370.

A close relative of Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who declined to be identified said the airlines had asked the next-of-kin of passengers and crew to wait at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) but they preferred to wait at home.

"MAS has informed all next-of-kin of passengers and crew members to be present at KLIA but so long as we are not getting the latest news from MAS, we will just wait at home.

"We obtained some information on the missing plane this morning," he said when met at Fariq's house in Jalan Platinum 7/56, Section 7 here today.

Fariq, the youngest son of Selangor Public Works Department deputy director Abdul Hamid Mad Daud, has recorded more than 2,763 hours of flying time. He began his career with MAS in 2007.

Meanwhile, Abdul Hamid declined to meet the media which had gathered in front of his house for comments.

The aircraft flown by Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, left Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am and was scheduled to land at the Beijing International Airport at 6.30am (Beijing time) with 239 people onboard, including 12 crew members. -- BERNAMA
