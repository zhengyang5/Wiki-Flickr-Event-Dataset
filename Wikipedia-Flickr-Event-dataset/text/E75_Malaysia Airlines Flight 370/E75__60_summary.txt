SYDNEY (Reuters) - Dutch engineering firm Fugro will lead the search of the Indian Ocean seafloor where missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is believed to have crashed, hoping to unlock the greatest mystery in modern aviation.
Australian Transport Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said Fugro was selected after "offering the best value-for-money technical solution" for the seafloor search.
"I remain cautiously optimistic that we will locate the missing aircraft within the priority search area," he told reporters in Canberra.
The Dutch company is already conducting a detailed underwater mapping of the search area, along with a Chinese naval vessel.
Malaysia will provide four vessels and gear to aid seafloor mapping and the search of the storm-lashed and isolated area.
