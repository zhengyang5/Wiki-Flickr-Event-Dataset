But if MH370 had been fitted with technology that made use of the cloud it may never have been lost in the first place.
We still don't know if MH370 disappeared because of a technical failure or a malicious security breach.
They would be in a much better position than they are in the case of MH370.
The mystery surrounding flight MH370 should galvanise authorities to help find the resources and enough good will to have it fully developed and implemented.
