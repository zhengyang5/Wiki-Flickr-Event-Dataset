The defence and acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said on Sunday that 15 countries have been contacted for assistance, including China, Burma, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.
Assistance will include satellite data and analysis, ground-search capabilities, radar data, and maritime and air deployment, Hishammuddin tweeted.
Australia and France have also been asked for help, he added, after authorities announced they would abandon their search-and-rescue missions in the South China Sea and Malacca strait and focus instead on the two corridors.
Malaysian police had spent the weekend investigating the crew, passengers and engineers who may have had contact with MH370 before takeoff last Saturday at 12.41am, Hishammuddin confirmed.
Further announcements were expected on Sunday afternoon, when Malaysia's police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, was due to speak to reporters in Kuala Lumpur.
