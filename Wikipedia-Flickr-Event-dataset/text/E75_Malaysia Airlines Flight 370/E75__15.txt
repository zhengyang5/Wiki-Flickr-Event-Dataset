Malaysia Airlines (MAS) says its missing Boeing 777-200 aircraft last underwent maintenance less than two weeks ago, and that no issues were identified during the routine check.

A spokeswoman for the carrier tells Flightglobal that the aircraft, registered 9M-MRO, last had an A-check on 23 February performed at a hangar at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. No issues were identified during the maintenance, she adds.

The MAS 777 has so far clocked over 53,400 hours and 7,525 flight cycles, she says.

The aircraft, which was performing flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, lost contact with the Subang Air Traffic Control at around 02:40 local time on 8 March. Its last reported position was over an area of sea between Malaysia and Vietnam.

Malaysia has since said that the aircraft could have performed an air turn back and has expanded the area of search. It is also looking closely at four names on the passenger manifest and working with terrorism units from various countries.
