(AP Photo/Andy Wong) The first comprehensive report into the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 revealed Sunday that the battery of the locator beacon for the plane's data recorder had expired more than a year before the jet vanished on March 8, 2014.
In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared the incident an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead.
However, the report said the battery in the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working.
Even though the beacon's battery had expired, the instrument itself was functioning properly and would have in theory captured all the flight information.
There were 99 shipments of lithium ion batteries on Malaysia Airlines flights to Beijing from January to May last year, it added.
