By Joanne ChiuMalaysia Airlines will retire flight number 370 on its busy service between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, days after the disappearance of one of its widebody jets on that route.
Malaysia Airlines will replace the northbound flight from Friday with new flight number 318, with the return flight to Kuala Lumpur changing to flight 319 from flight 371.
The carrier, which operates double daily services to Beijing from its Kuala Lumpur hub, said it has no plans to change its frequencies on the route.
Airlines often retire flight numbers following fatal crashes so as not to evoke negative emotions among other passengers and crew.
In 2011, United Airlines apologized for inadvertently reactivating the flight numbers of two of its planes that crashed after being hijacked by terrorists on Sept. 11, 2001.
