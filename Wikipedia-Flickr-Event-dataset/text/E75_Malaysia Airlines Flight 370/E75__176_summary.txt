Malaysian police have expanded an investigation into the missing Malaysia Airlines plane to include ground crew, caterers and the farmers who picked four tons of mangosteens - a tropical fruit - that were in the hold.
"Imagine how many people we must interview to rule out sabotage - and that is just for mangosteens," he said.
"Then, we had to see who was to receive them in China and who paid for it, and how much."
A source close to the investigation told The Telegraph that reassessment - which concluded the plane had flown faster and run out of fuel earlier than previously thought - was based on data from Malaysian military radar.
Najib Razak, Malaysia's prime minister, visited the operation's base near Perth to meet the search teams and described the effort as a "Herculean task".
