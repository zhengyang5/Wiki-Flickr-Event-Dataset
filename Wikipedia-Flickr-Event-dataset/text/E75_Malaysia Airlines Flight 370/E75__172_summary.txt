Flight MH370: modelling shows debris may be further north, say scientists Read moreThe Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which is leading the search for the plane off Australia’s west coast, told the Guardian on Thursday that “the MH370 captain’s flight simulator showed someone had plotted a course to the southern Indian Ocean”.
It is not known whether the simulation was made by Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, but the simulator was in his home.
The ATSB said confirmation of the plotted course did not prove theories that the captain planned a deliberate murder-suicide.
The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (Jacc), which oversees the Australian government’s response to MH370, said the same in its operational update on Wednesday.
