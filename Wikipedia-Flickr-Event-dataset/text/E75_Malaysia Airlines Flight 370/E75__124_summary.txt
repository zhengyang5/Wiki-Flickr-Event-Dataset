KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The suspected new debris found in French overseas Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean could be from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight according to the drifting calculation, a Malaysian official said Monday.
The debris could be from the missing MH370 flight, as calculations of the drift of all debris expect that they would be around that area, said Ab Aziz Kaprawi, Malaysia's deputy transport minister.
A wing part identified as flaperon was found on the island last year, the first debris confirmed to be from the missing flight.
Both Malaysian and Australian authorities, which coordinate search in the South Indian Ocean, have sent team to verify the debris.
Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, most of them being Chinese nationals.
