In undertaking the role of coordinating whole-of-Australian Government information, messaging and activities, the JACC works with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, Geoscience Australia, Department of Defence, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as many other Commonwealth and state government agencies. The JACC is engaged with all countries involved in the search.

JACC

On 30 March 2014, the former Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Tony Abbott MP, established the JACC to coordinate the Australian Government's support for the search into missing flight MH370.

Originally based in Perth, on 5 May 2014, the former Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Warren Truss MP, announced that the JACC would relocate to Canberra to ensure ongoing close communication with high level representatives from Malaysia and the People's Republic of China.

On the retirement of the Hon Warren Truss in 2016, portfolio responsibility for the search for MH370 was assumed by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Hon Darren Chester MP.

Despite the suspension of the search, the JACC is still currently operational at its Canberra base in the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities.

Cost of the Search

The Australian Government has provided around $90 million as part of Australia's contribution to the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, including $60 million towards the cost of the underwater search effort.

The total cost of the search is around $200 million.

The People's Republic of China contributed around $20 million in the form of funding and equipment.

Malaysia agreed to fund the balance of the costs, of around $120 million, associated with searching the 120,000 square kilometre search area.
