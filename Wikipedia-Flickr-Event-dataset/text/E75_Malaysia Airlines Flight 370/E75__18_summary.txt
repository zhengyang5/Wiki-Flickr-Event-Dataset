But the inquiry suggests a possible short-circuit or other fault resulted in electrical heating of the first officer's oxygen system hose, stored beneath the right-hand cockpit window.
"It is not yet known whether the oxygen system breach occurred first, providing a flammable environment, or whether the oxygen system breach occurred as a result of the fire."
A short-circuit might have resulted from contact between oxygen system components and aircraft wiring, if multiple wiring clamps were missing, or fractured, or if wires were incorrectly installed.
Routine checks by the crew, in preparation for the 29 July 2011 flight, revealed the oxygen system pressure was normal.
US investigators attributed the fire to a "lack of positive separation" between electrical wiring and conductive oxygen system components.
