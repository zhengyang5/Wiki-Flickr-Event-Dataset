Despite an extensive deep water search, led by Australia, the plane and all its passengers remain missing.
Malaysia's transport minister Liow Tiong Lai said on Twitter that based on early reports, there was a "high possibility debris found in Mozambique belongs to a B777".
But he said: "I urge everyone to avoid undue speculation as we are not able to conclude that the debris belongs to MH370 at this time."
