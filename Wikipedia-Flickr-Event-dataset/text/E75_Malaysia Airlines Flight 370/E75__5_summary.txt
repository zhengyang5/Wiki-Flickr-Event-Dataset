The search will now shift to a slow and uncertain 12-month hunt across a broad stretch of the Indian Ocean.
Analysts said the search — already the most expensive and extensive in aviation history — could cost “at least” hundreds of millions of pounds.
Malaysia and China will continue to conduct the search with Australia but the two countries are planning to hire private contractors to run the underwater search.
The search authority plans to hire private contractors to operate underwater search equipment when the underwater maps are complete.
“The underwater search will aim to locate the aircraft and any evidence (such as aircraft debris and flight recorders),” it said.
