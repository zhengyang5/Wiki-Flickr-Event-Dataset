Malaysia Airlines has already been handed $110 million (Â£67 million) by insurers over the loss of its missing Boeing 777 on flight MH370 that is the subject of an international search after disappearing more than two weeks ago.
The payment was made in accordance with standard air travel industry policy which says that if a plane has been missing for more than two days then it is assumed it has been destroyed.
The policy was originally taken out in Malaysia but, as is common practice in the industry, it was reinsured with a group of large international financial groups lead by Allianz.
If terrorism or negligence is found to have played a role it could alter the size and liability of the payouts and insurers are watching closely the hunt for the missing jet.
The Boeing 777 went missing in the early hours of the morning of March 8 on a flight between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing.
