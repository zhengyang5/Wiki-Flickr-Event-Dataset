The elusive black box of missing Malaysia Airlines jet MH370 would still be transmitting its location if the aviation industry had swiftly adopted recommendations to extend the battery life of the devices to 90 days.
The recommendations to increase the capability of the batteries from the current limit of 30 days were made in the aftermath of the probe into Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.
Investigators urged regulators to require planes to carry the long-life batteries in their black boxes as "rapidly as possible", as well as giving them a more powerful signal range, currently limited to as little as one nautical mile.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation, a UN agency, took until this year to recommend the longer battery life, but delayed implementation until 2018.
