German insurer Allianz had allocated several millions of dollars as the lead insurer of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.
The company has taken a $30m (Â£17.88m) hit or about 9% of the insured market loss on the plane that went missing in March, Allianz Chief Financial Officer Dieter Wemmer told journalists at a conference call.
The amount is higher than initially expected as the costs for searching have to be added to the loss.
A Boeing 777 operated by Malaysia Airlines went missing less than one hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.
Since it went missing, more than two dozen countries have been involved in the hunt for the plane.
