The Malaysia Transport Ministry’s first report on the probe of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370), released today, adds few relevant details to the little already known about why the flight disappeared, while recommending that industry explore real-time tracking of aircraft.
The report, dated April 9 but made public today, confirms MH370 departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 00:41:43 local time March 8 en route to Beijing.
At 01:19:24, Kuala Lumpur control handed MH370 off to controllers in Ho Chi Minh, and somebody on MH370’s flight deck acknowledged the request.
After about a half hour of attempting to locate the flight, Kuala Lumpur controllers at 02:15 contacted the airline’s operations center, which determined that it could “exchange signals with the flight” and that it was in Cambodian airspace.
It is not clear how the publicly released report compares to the one provided to ICAO.
