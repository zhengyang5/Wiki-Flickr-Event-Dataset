Yet questions over the use and sharing of information during the hunt for MH370 have revealed the continuing suspicions between them.
How much they are disclosing to Malaysia – and to China, which had more than 150 passengers aboard the flight – is unclear.
Malaysia has criticised China for releasing satellite images which it had not passed to Kuala Lumpur.
As Malaysia sought to confirm whether radar sightings were, as it thought, of MH370, one obvious question was whether neighbouring countries could help.
"Actually, this is not a multinational search; each country has searched by themselves," added Hong Nong, a professor at China's National Institute for South China Sea Studies.
