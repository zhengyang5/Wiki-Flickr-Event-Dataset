While the search for the missing Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines flight continues, the mystery surrounding the two passengers who used stolen passports to board flight MH370 intensifies.
The Financial Times exclusively reported that the Thai travel agency that booked the tickets for the men had been asked to by an Iranian middleman.
the passports were reported missing a year ago by Luigi Maraldi and Christian Kozel respectively.
The one-way tickets under those names were issued by a travel agency in Pattaya, eastern Thailand.
She added that it was quite common for people to book tickets through middlemen who then retake a commission.
