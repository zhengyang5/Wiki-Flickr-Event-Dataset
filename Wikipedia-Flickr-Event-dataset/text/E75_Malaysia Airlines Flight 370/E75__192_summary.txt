Bickering between Malaysia, China and others involved in trying to solve the baffling weekend disappearance of the jet has exposed longstanding tensions and prevented a coordinated response, they said.
Since then, there have been frustrating delays and much confusion in the release of scarce but essential information, such as radar data and satellite imagery.
It then appeared to surprise the Malaysians by releasing the satellite data.
Highlighting the lack of cooperation, Vietnam Civil Aviation Authority deputy director Dinh Viet Thang earlier said Vietnamese officials had only learnt of the Chinese satellite sighting on the Internet, not from official channels.
But again Hussein defended his country, saying Malaysia was releasing sensitive radar data that would normally be kept confidential.
