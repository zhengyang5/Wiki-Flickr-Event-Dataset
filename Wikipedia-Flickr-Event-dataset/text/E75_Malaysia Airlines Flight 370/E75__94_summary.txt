Fugro Discovery is docked in the Western Australian port of Fremantle to be fitted with a towfish and other equipment.
Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesThe deep-sea hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 resumed Monday in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean as the first search ship began sonar sweeps of the ocean floor.
A third vessel that will take part in the search, Fugro Equator, is completing a bathymetric survey of a long but narrow arc of sea floor where the search has been concentrated.
An initial underwater search also failed to find any trace of Flight 370.
The ship GO Phoenix and equipment and a crew provided by Phoenix International was sent by Malaysia’s government to assist Fugro’s vessels.
