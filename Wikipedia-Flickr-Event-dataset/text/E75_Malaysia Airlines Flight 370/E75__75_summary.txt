Political NewsAustralia is taking charge of the search in the Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane and has promised to commit more resources to finding the aircraft.
In a significant deepening of Australia's responsibility, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament on Monday afternoon that Australia would co-ordinate operations in the vast search area to its west.
The Indian Ocean lies on one of two ''vectors'' that authorities have identified as paths the mystery flight might have taken.
Mr Abbott said he spoke to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak early Monday afternoon and was asked to take over the Indian Ocean search.
I offered the Malaysian Prime Minister additional maritime surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted.''
