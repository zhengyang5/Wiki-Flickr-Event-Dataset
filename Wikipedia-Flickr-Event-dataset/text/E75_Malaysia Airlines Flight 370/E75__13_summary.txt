The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER bearing registration 9M-MRO had a history free of major incidents prior to its disappearance on 8 March.
However the aircraft was reportedly involved in a minor ground collision two years ago which resulted in significant damage to a wingtip.
According to Flightglobalâ€™s Ascend Online Fleets database, 9M- MRO bears manufacturer serial number 28420 and its line number is 404.
The aircraft reportedly suffered a ground incident in August 2012 when its wingtip collided with the tail of a China Eastern Airlines Airbus A340 while taxiing in Shanghai.
According to Ascend, the 777's minor variant is 777-2H6ER.
