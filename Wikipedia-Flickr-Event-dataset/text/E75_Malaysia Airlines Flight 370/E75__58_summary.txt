The JACC is engaged with all countries involved in the search.
On the retirement of the Hon Warren Truss in 2016, portfolio responsibility for the search for MH370 was assumed by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Hon Darren Chester MP.
Despite the suspension of the search, the JACC is still currently operational at its Canberra base in the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities.
The People's Republic of China contributed around $20 million in the form of funding and equipment.
Malaysia agreed to fund the balance of the costs, of around $120 million, associated with searching the 120,000 square kilometre search area.
