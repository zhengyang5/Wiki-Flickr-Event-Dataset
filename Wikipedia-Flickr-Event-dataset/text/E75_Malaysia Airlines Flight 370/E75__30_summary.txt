SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Employees of Freescale Semiconductor who were on a Malaysia Airlines flight presumed to have crashed were doing sophisticated work at the U.S. chipmaker, a company spokesman said on Sunday.
The 20 Freescale employees, among 239 people on flight MH370, were mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice president, global communications and investor relations.
While the employees on the flight account for less than 1 percent of Freescale’s global workforce of 16,800 people, they were working toward the same goals and their loss will reverberate throughout Freescale, Haws said.
They had been streamlining facilities in Tianjin and Kuala Lumpur that Freescale uses for testing and packaging microchips used in automobiles, consumer products, telecommunications infrastructure and industrial equipment.
One of the chipmaker’s long-time competitors, Texas Instruments, tweeted on Saturday: “We extend our condolences to the families and coworkers of the @Freescale employees aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.”
