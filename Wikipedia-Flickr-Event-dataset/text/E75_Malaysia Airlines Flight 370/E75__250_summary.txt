The tragic disappearance of MH370 in March put the spotlight on aircraft surveillance like never before.
The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the last moments and whereabouts of MH370 has left many people surprised at the realities of current aircraft tracking and surveillance technologies.
IATA has launched the Aircraft Tracking Task Force (ATTF) focused on identifying near-term options for global tracking of aircraft.
Aircraft surveillance is an ATC function for the purpose of providing a separation service, whereas tracking is about being able to independently locate an aircraft at any given point.
Space based ADS-B has the potential to provide near global aircraft surveillance.
