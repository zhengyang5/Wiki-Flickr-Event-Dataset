According to satellite and radar evidence, he said, the plane then changed course and could have continued flying for a further seven hours.
Only four weeks ago an Ethiopian Airlines co-pilot hijacked his own plane to seek political asylum in Switzerland.
The pilot of this Malaysian plane had a commendable record but the authorities have still raided his home.
An extensive search of the seas around Malaysia - involving 14 countries, 43 ships and 58 aircraft - since the plane disappeared had proved fruitless.
