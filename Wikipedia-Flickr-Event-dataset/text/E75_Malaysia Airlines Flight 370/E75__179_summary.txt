KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS) - Malaysia's air force chief denied a media report that the military last tracked a missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner over the Strait of Malacca, far from where it last made contact with civilian air traffic control when it disappeared four days ago.
"I wish to state that I did not make any such statements," air force chief Rodzali Daud said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Strait of Malacca, one of the world's busiest shipping channels, runs along Malaysia's west coast.
However all ongoing search operations are at the moment being conducted to cover all possible areas where the aircraft could have gone down in order to ensure no possibility is overlooked.
