SAINTE-MARIE (France): Active air and sea searches for fragments of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 off Reunion island will stop on Monday after just over a week, the local authorities said.
This has been handed over to investigators but there is nothing the size of the Boeing 777 wing part found on Reunion last month that Malaysian authorities have said comes from MH370.
The searches, which began last Friday, have covered nearly 10,000 sq km (almost 3,900 sq miles) of ocean, Sorain said.
Police have spent 200 hours searching for debris, added Sorain, who gave no indication of the missionâ€™s cost.
The tiny Indian Ocean island of Reunion has been in the global media spotlight since the large wing part called a flaperon was discovered on its shores last month.
