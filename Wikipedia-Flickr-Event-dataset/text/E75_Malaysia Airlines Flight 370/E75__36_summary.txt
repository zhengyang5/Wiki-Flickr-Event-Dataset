BEIJING : Relatives of Chinese passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight were holding onto a “thin ray of hope” their loved ones were alive, a psychologist told AFP Monday.
Flight MH370 disappeared an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early on Saturday, leaving families of more than 150 Chinese on board facing the grim reality that their loved ones could have perished.
He had been supporting other families by telephone soon after the plane was lost, he said.
Many of the families would not want to travel to Malaysia, he added, despite transport being offered by the airline.
It was important not to “overstate the hopes” to families that their relatives could have survived, he emphasised.
