The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it has determined a search area of about 83,800 square miles of the Indian Ocean, about 657 miles northwest of Perth, Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre reported.
A total of 10 military planes, four civil jets and nine ships will be assisting the search Friday when weather conditions are expected to hold up.
The plane’s data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by equipment called pinger locators, which will be towed by a ship from the U.S. Navy and the British navy’s HMS Echo, covering a 150-mile long track.
“The area of highest probability as to where the aircraft might have entered the water is the area where the underwater search will commence,” Angus Houston, the head of a joint agency coordinating the search, reportedly said.
On Thursday, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, described the search as "the most difficult in human history" and warned there was no guarantee the missing plane would be found.
