Arrangements in AustraliaThe arrangements for search and rescue (SAR) in Australia have been influenced by the physical size of the island continent, the large size of the search and rescue region, Australia's relatively small population and the nature of governmental processes.
In 1999 a shift in perspective saw the group renamed the National Search and Rescue Council with the role of formulating, discussing and ratifying national search and rescue policies.
The parties to the Arrangements agreed that the National SAR Council will continue to be the national coordinating body for search and rescue operations by overseeing search and rescue arrangements in Australia's search and rescue region, sponsoring the National SAR Manual, and overseeing the ongoing effectiveness of the cooperative arrangements between Australian search and rescue authorities.
