Kelly IpThursday, March 13, 2014Relatives of mainland passengers on flight MH370 have accepted "comfort money" of 31,000 yuan (HK$39,174) for each person on board.
About a dozen relatives who traveled to Kuala Lumpur to be closer to search efforts will receive the grant there.
Media there reported a big difference in the grants, with Malaysian families only getting about HK$15,000.
In a meeting with the Malaysia Civil Aviation Department, families demanded details of how the aircraft signal suddenly disappeared.
In Kuala Lumpur, the tension took its toll on a 60-year-old father.
