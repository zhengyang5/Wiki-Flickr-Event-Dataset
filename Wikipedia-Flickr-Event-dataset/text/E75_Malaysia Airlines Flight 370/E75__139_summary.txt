Angus Houston will head a joint agency coordination centre in Perth to oversee efforts to find debris from Malaysia Airlines flightFormer Australian defence force chief Angus Houston will co-ordinate international efforts to find the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, ahead of a fresh attempt to locate the aircraftâ€™s debris.
Tony Abbott said Houston, a retired Air Chief Marshal, will head a new joint agency coordination centre, based in Perth, which will oversee the efforts to find the plane.
The agency will help co-ordinate Australian and international efforts to locate the flight, which went missing more than three weeks ago, carrying 239 passengers and crew.
Objects already retrieved from the ocean by a Chinese ship off Western Australia are not part of the missing plane, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has confirmed.
A total of eight ships will also be deployed in the search for the plane amid an unfavourable weather forecast.
