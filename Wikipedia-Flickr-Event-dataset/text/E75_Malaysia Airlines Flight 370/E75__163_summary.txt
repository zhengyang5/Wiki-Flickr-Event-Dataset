Mother-of-three Faizah Khan faces questioning in an investigation supported by the FBI as the search for the plane enters its third week.
The insider said: “There seems to be nothing in the life of Fariq Hamid to suggest a motive for hijacking.

Australian maritime officials involved in the search confirmed yesterday that they were studying the new satellite information from the French.
