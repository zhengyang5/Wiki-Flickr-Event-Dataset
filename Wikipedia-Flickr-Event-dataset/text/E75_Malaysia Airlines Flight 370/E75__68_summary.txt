The governments of Malaysia, China and Australia called off the nearly three-year official search last January.
"That means they are willing to search the area of 25,000 square kilometers, about 9,653 square miles, pointed out by the expert group near the Australian waters," he said.
In the initial search for the plane, a 52-day surface search covered an area of several million square kilometers (square miles) in the Indian Ocean west of Australia, before an underwater search mapped 710,000 square kilometers (274,000 square miles) of seabed at depths of up to 6,000 meters, about 20,000 feet.
The search team also looked back at satellite imagery that showed objects in the ocean that may have been MH370 debris.
The search was extremely difficult because no transmissions were received from the aircraft after its first 38 minutes of flight.
