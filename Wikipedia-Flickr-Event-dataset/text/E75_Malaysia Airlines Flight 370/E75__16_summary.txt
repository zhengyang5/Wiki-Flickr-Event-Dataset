Aviation experts have expressed surprise at the sudden loss of contact with the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, which has an almost flawless safety record.
Mohan Ranganathan, an aviation safety consultant who serves on India’s Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Committee, said it was “very, very rare” for an aircraft to lose contact completely without any previous indication of problems.
Malaysia Airlines did have an incident in August 2005 with a 777 flying from Perth to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.
Malaysia Airlines has 15 Boeing 777-200ER jets in its fleet of about 100 planes.
Saturday’s Malaysia Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing was scheduled to take five and a half hours, one of the shorter routes worldwide for the 777.
