Earlier it was announced the search would now focus on an area 1,100km (700 miles) north-east of the previous zone.
The Chinese patrol ship Haixun 01 is in the search area and will be despatched to relocate the objects on Saturday, Amsa said.
This would reduce the possible distance the aircraft travelled south into the Indian Ocean, officials said.
Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south.
