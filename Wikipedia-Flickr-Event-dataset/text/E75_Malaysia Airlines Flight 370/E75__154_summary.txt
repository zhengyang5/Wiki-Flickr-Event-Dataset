Investigators are trying to uncover the true identities of the passengers who used the stolen passports of Italian Luigi Maraldi, 37 and Austrian Christian Kozel whose passports were stolen on the Thai resort island of Phuket.
Tickets bought by two passengers using false passports in the names of Christian Kozel and Luigi Maraldi.
