BackgroundAt the request of the Malaysian Government, Australia is leading the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the Indian Ocean.
The search is a complex operation that involves vast areas with only limited data and aircraft flight information available.
Given the relative accuracy of the aircraft’s last known position, a circular search area of 40 NM was defined (17,240 km²).
HydrophonesLow frequency hydroacoustic signals present in the Indian Ocean are being examined to determine whether they can provide any information to help define the search area.
This provides a reasonable limitation for the size of the search area across the arc.
