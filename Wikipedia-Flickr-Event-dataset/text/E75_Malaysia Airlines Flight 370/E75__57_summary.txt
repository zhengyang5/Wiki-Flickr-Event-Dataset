A British woman sailing with her husband across the Indian Ocean from India to Thailand has claimed she may have seen the missing Malaysia Airlines plane on fire.
“I looked back through our GPS logs and lo and behold, what we saw was consistent with the confirmed contact which the authorities had from MH370,” she told Thailand’s Phuket Gazette .
Ms Tee said she saw other planes nearby and thought they would have reported the burning plane.
“I saw something that looked like a plane on fire,” she said.
I was looking at what appeared to be an elongated plane glowing bright orange, with a trail of black smoke behind it.
