Last month, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.
The airline faces competition on its home turf from AirAsia, a privately owned low-cost airline that has grown rapidly since beginning operations more than a decade ago.
Malaysia Airlines’ response in recent years has been to sell discounted tickets as well as to add capacity, in part using Airbus A380 double-decker planes.
But analysts said that the airline would have to drastically reduce the number of its destinations to survive.
After independence, the government used the airline as a tool to raise the country’s profile in Asia and around the world.
