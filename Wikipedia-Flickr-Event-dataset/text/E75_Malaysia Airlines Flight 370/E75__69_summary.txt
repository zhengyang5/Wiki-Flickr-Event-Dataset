She is a Norwegian research vessel, built in 2014 and owned by Swire Seabed, a dredging and surveying firm in Bergen.
The plan is for Ocean Infinity’s search to be paid for, on a “no find, no fee” basis, by Malaysia alone.
Once underwater, the robot craft will communicate with the ship using an acoustic modem.
The HUGINs’ search patterns are set by people, but the craft will actually navigate with little reference to their mother ship.
A follow-up trip to examine the wreckage, and even bring it to the surface, would require further authorisation from the Malaysian government.
