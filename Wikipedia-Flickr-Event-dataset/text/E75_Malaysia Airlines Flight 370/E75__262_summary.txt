The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is raising new questions about the tracking technology inside airplane cockpits.
The primary transponder on board Flight 370 was turned off, preventing air traffic controllers from tracking the plane, CBS News' Jeff Pegues reports.
In the case of Flight 370, after the primary transponder was powered down, the backup didn't activate, and the plane disappeared from radar.
Once a plane is on the ground and within vision of air traffic control, a transponder in the "on" position could clutter radar.
Transponders offer air traffic controllers a location of a plane by calculating airspeed and altitude.
