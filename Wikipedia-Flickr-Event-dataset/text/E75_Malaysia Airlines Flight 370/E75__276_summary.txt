The data behind the search for MH370: Phase One data releasedGeoscience Australia is today releasing the sea floor mapping data collected during the first phase of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.
The search was conducted in two phases - the first phase was a survey to collect bathymetry data, or data of the sea floor topography, to develop maps of the sea floor in the search area.
Geoscience Australia is delivering the data on behalf of the Australian Government, with Phase One released today and Phase Two being released in mid-2018.
We have also been responsible for the processing and analysis of the two phases of search data," Dr Minchin said.
For more experienced users, the Phase One data is available through two data visualisation platforms on our website to interrogate the data in different ways.
