The hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was called off Tuesday after almost three years of fruitless toil.
Australian investigators put the cost of the operation at A$180 million ($135 million).
The scouring for the jet is the longest search for a missing plane in modern aviation history.
Search teams had battled ferocious winter weather and waves more than five stories high as they dragged sonar devices across the seabed.
Air-traffic controllers lost contact with MH370 less than an hour after takeoff as it approached Vietnam.
