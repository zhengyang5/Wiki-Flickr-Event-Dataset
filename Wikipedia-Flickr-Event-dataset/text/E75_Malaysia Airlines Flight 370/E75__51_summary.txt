Malaysia Airlines has now confirmed that its missing Boeing 777-200ER operating flight MH370 did not send out a distress call or any Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System Messages (ACARS) before it disappeared.
While the initial search was focused on the expected flight path of the aircraft between Malaysia and Vietnam heading principally north, the search and rescue effort now includes a much broader area.
“The authorities are looking at the possibility of an attempt made by MH370 to turn back to Subang,” the airline says.
The search scope has been expanded to include the sea off Malaysia’s West Coast and the Straits of Malacca.
The aircraft underwent scheduled maintenance on February 23, 2014, 12 days before the March 8 flight as MH370.
