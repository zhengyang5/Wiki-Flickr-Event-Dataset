The terrorism theory weakened after Malaysian authorities determined that one of the two men was an Iranian asylum seeker.
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters the 19-year-old Iranian man was believed to be planning to enter Germany to seek asylum.
He said she contacted Malaysian authorities to inform them of her concern when her son didnâ€™t get in touch with her.
Khalid said the other man traveling with the Iranian had arrived in Malaysia on the same day, and had yet to be identified.
The new statement said authorities are looking at a possibility that MH370 attempted to turn back toward Kuala Lumpur.
