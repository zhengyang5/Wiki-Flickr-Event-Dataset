Malaysian officials said Sunday that they would seek help from territories near the island where a suspected piece of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet was discovered to try to find more plane debris.
A wing flap suspected to be from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was found Wednesday on Reunion.
Flight 370 is the only missing 777 and many are convinced the flap comes from the ill-fated jet.
The new piece of debris found on a beach near the town of Saint-Denis on Sunday morning had nothing to do with the investigation involving the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Rahman said.
About two-thirds of those aboard Flight 370 were Chinese.
