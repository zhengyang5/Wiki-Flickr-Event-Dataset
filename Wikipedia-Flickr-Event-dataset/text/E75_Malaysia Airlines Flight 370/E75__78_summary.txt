Search teams hunting for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have spotted hundreds of objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean.
Australian satellite spots objects on 16 MarchObject 24m in lengthImage copyright Australian GovernmentAustralian officials released images last week showing two whitish objects on or just under the surface of the ocean.
The images, taken by the Thaichote satellite on 24 March, show objects about 200km (120 miles) from the French satellite sighting.
Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south.
"Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week," Mr Hishammuddin said.
