When Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared on a clear Saturday night from radar screens, no one could explain how the Boeing 777 had seemingly vanished into thin air.
Seven days later, there is far more confusion and misinformation circulating than solid evidence, and the aircraft with 239 people on board is still missing.
At 1am, the plane was scheduled to enter Vietnamese air space while flying between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh City and did not.
Twelve hours after the plane vanished, search-and-rescue teams from Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam began looking for debris or wreckage off Vietnam.
