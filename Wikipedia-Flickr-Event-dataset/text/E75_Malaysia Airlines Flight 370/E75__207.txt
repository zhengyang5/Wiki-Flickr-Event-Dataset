KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia Airlines on Thursday reported a 75 percent wider loss in second-quarter earnings as passenger bookings continued to fall in response to the loss of two aircraft in separate disasters this year.

The airline said its net loss in the quarter ended in June grew to 307.04 million Malaysian ringgit, or $97.6 million, from $55.9 million a year earlier, though the result was an improvement from the net loss of $140.8 million in the first quarter.

The second-quarter earnings are the first to fully reflect the effect on sales of the unexplained disappearance of Flight MH370 in March. The airline also warned of poor second-half earnings, saying that average weekly bookings had declined 33 percent, with numerous flight cancellations immediately after the shooting down of Flight MH17 over Ukraine in July.

The airline is set to be taken private by its majority shareholder, the state fund Khazanah Nasional, in a move to revamp its business — effectively giving the government full control. An announcement of a reorganization plan was expected this week.

Malaysia Airlines said the MH17 incident had derailed “all the hard work and effort” to regain market confidence it had put in after the loss of MH370. “The fact that both incidents have occurred within such a short span of time had exacerbated the situation and severely damaged the airline’s brand and business reputation, accelerating the need to restructure the company,” it said.
