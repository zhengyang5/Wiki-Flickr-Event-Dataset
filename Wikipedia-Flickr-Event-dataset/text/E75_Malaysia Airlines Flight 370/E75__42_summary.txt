Some 72 hours after contact with the Boeing 777 flying over the Gulf of Thailand was lost, what really happened to Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight remains a mystery.
Facts:Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has disappeared from radars about 40 minutes after take off from Kuala Lumpur.
However, the change in heading was probably performed in accordance with the FPL (Flight Plane) as the plane did the same, at the same position, on Mar.
What we don’t know yet:Since no debris was found yet, we don’t know what happened aboard MH370.
Or the hijacking attempt may have been conducted by the pilot or copilot (as happened for recent Ethiopian airlines flight).
