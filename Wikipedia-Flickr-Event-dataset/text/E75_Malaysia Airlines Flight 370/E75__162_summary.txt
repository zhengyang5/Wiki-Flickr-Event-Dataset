Transport Minister Warren Truss said it was “highly, highly likely” the missing Malaysian Airlines flight was on autopilot when it crashed into the southern Indian Ocean on March 8, becoming the “greatest aviation mystery in global history”.
And investigators had yet another revelation, telling reporters it is believed the missing jet likely plunged into the ocean further south than the current search area.
This came as Mr Truss announced the hunt for MH370 would return to the original search area, but would this time scour underwater.
Meanwhile Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has replaced Hishammuddin Hussein as transport minister.
Hishammuddin, who is also defence minister, provisionally held the transport portfolio after the post was left vacant following elections a year ago.
