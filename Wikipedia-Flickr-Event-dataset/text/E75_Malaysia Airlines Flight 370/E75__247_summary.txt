Malaysia is set to lose RM4.2 billion in tourism revenue as tourists from China look elsewhere following the MH370 incident, the South China Morning Post said today.
"If each tourist spent an average of 10,000 yuan (RM5,300) during their stay, the total loss could rise to between 4 billion (RM2.1 billion) and 8 billion yuan (RM4.2 billion).
The controversy surrounding missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has prompted many Chinese tourists to shun Malaysia.
SCMP reported that China International Travel Service, China Youth Travel Service, and BTG International Travel and Tours have reported decreasing numbers.
According to Tourism Malaysia, 1.79 million Chinese visited the country last year, a nearly 15% annual increase.
