Relatives of mainland passengers on flight MH370 have accepted "comfort money" of 31,000 yuan (HK$39,174) for each person on board.

The money was handed out to family members in Beijing about 6pm yesterday.

About a dozen relatives who traveled to Kuala Lumpur to be closer to search efforts will receive the grant there.

Media there reported a big difference in the grants, with Malaysian families only getting about HK$15,000.

An airline spokesman made clear the grant is separate from compensation.

A task force set up by Beijing submitted a list of demands by families. In a meeting with the Malaysia Civil Aviation Department, families demanded details of how the aircraft signal suddenly disappeared.

Families asked whether authorities were trying to hide anything and demanded the Malaysian government make a full disclosure.

A family representative also demanded an apology from the Malaysian ambassador Iskandar Sarudin but other families rejected it.

They said it was more important to look for the plane.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Malaysia should be held accountable.

In Kuala Lumpur, the tension took its toll on a 60-year-old father.

Selamat Omar said life since his youngest son went missing five days ago has been very tough. "I will pretend he is on a business trip, only that I don't know when he will come back," he said, breaking down. Another Malaysian father said his son and daughter- in-law were on their way to Beijing for their honeymoon.

"They were supposed to be home today."
