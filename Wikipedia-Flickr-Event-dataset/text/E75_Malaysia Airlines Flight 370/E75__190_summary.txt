“We are in contact with his mother,” Mr. Khalid said at a news conference.
Interpol confirmed the identity of the other Iranian, Mr. Mehrdad, but gave his age as 18.
Mr. Khalid said that the two men had arrived in Malaysia on the same day, Feb. 28.
He added that the two men had traveled to Kuala Lumpur on Iranian passports before using the stolen Italian and Austrian passports to board the flight.
The stolen passports used to board the flight had been taken during the past two years in Phuket, another Thai beach resort.
