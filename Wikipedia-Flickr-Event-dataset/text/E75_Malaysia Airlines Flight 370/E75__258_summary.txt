Now, the aviation industry is grappling with another question: Where are the promised flight tracking systems that would prevent this from ever happening again?
The IATA just released a study from its Aircraft Tracking Task Force, which, after the disappearance of MH370, was charged with developing tracking options for planes.
Thanks to the modernization of air traffic control systems, that tracking is already improving, but that alone won't be enough to track all planes if airlines don't make their own upgrades.
The IATA report is supposed to contain information about how many airlines are already equipped for real-time tracking, but the details have not yet been made public.
Plus, there's the question of authority: The IATA can't make the airlines fall in line and add new tracking tech.
