The Australian government released several photos of a wing flap believed to belong to the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.
The debris was discovered on Pemba Island near Tanzania in late-June and was transported to Australia for examination, according to a report released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).
ATSB"Malaysia and Australia have worked with Tanzanian officials to assume responsibility for the item, believed to be an outboard wing flap," the ATSB said in a joint statement.
"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is working with Malaysian investigators to ascertain whether it is from a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777," the statement added.
MH370 went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 while carrying 239 passengers and crew.
