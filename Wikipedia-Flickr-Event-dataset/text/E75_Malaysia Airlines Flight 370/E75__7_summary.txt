One of the parts retrieved in Mozambique was found on a sandbank by an amateur US investigator in late February.
Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai later told a news conference that paint samples from the debris indicated they were parts of the missing plane.
Secondly, from the paint and the stencils of these two pieces, it is similar to MAS (Malaysian Airlines) airlines paint.
Malaysia says it is awaiting permission from South Africa to conduct a search of its coast for more debris.
