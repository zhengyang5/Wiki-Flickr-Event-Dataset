SYDNEY: Australia will take responsibility for the "southern vector" of the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, with 25 countries now involved in a huge operation to locate the plane, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday.
"He asked that Australia take responsibility for the search on the southern vector, which the Malaysian authorities now think was one possible flight path for this ill-fated aircraft," Abbott told parliament.
I offered the Malaysian prime minister additional maritime surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted."
It will do our duty to ensure that our search and rescue responsibilities are maintained and upheld," he said.
Australia has two Orion surveillance aircraft assisting with the search for the plane, which was en route to Beijing when it disappeared.
