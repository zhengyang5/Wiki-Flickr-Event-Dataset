At least four Chinese travel booking platforms said they will no longer book flights on Malaysia Airlines.
The strained relationship between the countries comes in the year intended to be a “year of friendship”Chinese travel booking websites ELong, LY.com, Qunar and Mango recently announced that they would no longer be booking flights on Malaysia Airlines due to the plane that went missing earlier this month.
Since the plane went missing, the two countries have been making numerous accusations against each other.
Protesters in China have also accused Malaysia of deception and delays in solving the mystery of the missing plane.
With the animosity between the countries, we’re guessing there won’t be much tourism or business for the travel sites on Malaysia Airlines anyway.
