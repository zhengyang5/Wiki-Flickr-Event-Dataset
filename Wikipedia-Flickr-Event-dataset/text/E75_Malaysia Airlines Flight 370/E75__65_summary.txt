The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's (ATSB) final report into Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 calls for flight tracking that is even more precise than the 15-minute position tracking interval called for by ICAO.
"While there has been significant enhancements in the tracking of commercial aircraft in recent years there are some limitations to the improvements," says ATSB.
"The ICAO mandated 15-minute position tracking interval for existing aircraft may not reduce a potential search area enough to ensure that survivors and wreckage are located within a reasonable timeframe."
The ATSB adds that the underwater search for the aircraft, as of 30 June 2017, came to A$198 million ($155 million).
Of this, the underwater search cost A$170 million, bathymetry A$20 million, programme management A$7 million, and other items A$1 million.
