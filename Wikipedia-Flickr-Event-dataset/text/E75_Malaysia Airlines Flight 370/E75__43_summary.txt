But the Malaysian military radar data, which local authorities have declined to provide to the public, added significant information about the flight immediately after ground controllers lost contact with it.
Malaysian officials have acknowledged that military radar may have detected the plane, but have said they took no action because it did not appear hostile.
“It’s gotten better and better every day,” the official said, referring to information from the plane’s manufacturer, satellites and military radar.
A senior aircraft industry executive in the United States said the account of Flight 370’s movements that was emerging from the Malaysian military radar information matched what their officials were told.
Military radar last recorded the aircraft flying at an altitude of 29,500 feet, about 200 miles northwest of Penang and headed toward India’s Andaman Islands.
