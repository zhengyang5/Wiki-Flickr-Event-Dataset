(Reuters)Hong Kong protests have simmered, but students are calling for more demonstrations in response to the government calling off talks.
Demonstrators burn incense in front of a makeshift altar on a road blocked by protesters at the Mongkok shopping district in Hong Kong on Oct. 10 after Hong Kong called off talks with protesting students.
Those rules effectively gave Beijing and its loyalists in Hong Kong the power to choose who can be a candidate in those elections.
“I think it’s a big blunder again,” said Michael Davis, a law professor at Hong Kong University.
