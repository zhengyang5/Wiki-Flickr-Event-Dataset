VideoThe new elements injected on Friday were the gangs of attackers, who entered the fray a day after the Communist Party warned that there would be “chaos” in Hong Kong if the protests did not end.
Several protesters said the attackers groped and sexually harassed female protesters, and Amnesty International alleged that police officers watched and did nothing.
The mayhem derailed proposed talks between the Hong Kong government and student protesters, who are demanding democratic elections for the city’s leader, the chief executive.
The Hong Kong Federation of Students and one of the main protest groups, Occupy Central With Love and Peace, said Friday night that they would not participate in the talks and blamed the government for the violence.
“I hope everybody can persist in the spirit of peaceful resistance,” said Benny Tai, an associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong and a founder of Occupy Central With Love and Peace.
