The chairwoman of the Financial Services Development Council, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, has spelled out her stand on pushing for election reform.

She says be patient.

"American slaves were liberated in 1861 but did not get voting rights until 107 years later, so why can't Hong Kong wait for a while?"

The decision of the National People's Congress has expanded the voting rights to five million people from the 1,200 members in the nominating committee, said Cha, pictured, adding she can't see the decision is really that terrible.

The Hong Kong deputy to the NPC said democracy cannot be reached in just one step, and no one knows whether democracy will be achieved after 2017. So why not accept the current policy and wait longer?

It is meaningless to hold promotions should the Occupy protest continue, she added.

Cha, who is in Paris promoting Hong Kong in a roadshow, said investors' confidence is at a critical point, and once hurt it would be difficult to rebuild.
