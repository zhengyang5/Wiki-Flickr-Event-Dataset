Hong Kong's last governor Chris Patten has become the latest apparent convert to the "umbrella movement" in support of the pro-democracy protests.
"I can finally be photographed holding an umbrella just like President Xi Jinping ," Patten reportedly said, according to a tweet by Oxford China Forum.
He was referring to a photograph of Xi with an umbrella during his trip to Wuhan , Hubei province, in July last year.
Coinciding as it did with the "umbrella movement", the photo went viral along with numerous parodies created by protesters.
The forum further tweeted that Patten was "really impressed by the dignity, decency and seriousness of the protesters" and said "their mums and dads should be very proud".
