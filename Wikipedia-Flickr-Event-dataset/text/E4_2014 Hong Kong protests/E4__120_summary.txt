Thursday, November 13, 2014Occupy Central marshals yesterday made citizen's arrests on three men who pelted Next Media owner Jimmy Lai Chee-ying with bags containing rotten animal intestines at Admiralty.
The three men were handed over to the police but they are likely to be released after Lai said he would not press charges.
Alex Kwok, one of the volunteer marshals who "guards" protesters at the Admiralty site, said Lai was the prime target.
"It was evident Lai was the target of the three men ... [the bags] hit his head and his body," he said.
The media tycoon appeared shaken after the incident, but said he "would be back tomorrow."
