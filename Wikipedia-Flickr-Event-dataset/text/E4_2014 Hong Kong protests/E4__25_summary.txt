Dozens of students from universities and secondary schools joined the Hong Kong Army Cadets group at a ceremony yesterday in the Ngong Shuen Chau Naval Base in the city, the state-run China Daily reported today.
The newly created cadet group highlights China’s rising concern with Hong Kong students, who led the unprecedented protests last quarter seeking to remove Chinese limits on the city’s election.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying last week criticized a university publication in his annual policy address for advocating self-determination, and said young people need to be guided better.
Leung’s wife, Regina, is the cadet group’s commander, while former Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa is its honorary chairman, the China Daily reported.
Other than pledging to care for others and to build Hong Kong, the students also agreed to serve the country, the newspaper said.
