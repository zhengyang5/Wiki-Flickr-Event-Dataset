Heavy scrutiny of the 37,000-member department began eight days ago when police deployed tear gas on Hong Kong Island to push back demonstrators.
It was the first time tear gas had been used in Hong Kong since 2005, when protesters amassed against a World Trade Organization summit.
Many Hong Kong residents were stunned by what they thought was excessive force for a department that rarely has to deal with violent crime in a city of 7 million.
