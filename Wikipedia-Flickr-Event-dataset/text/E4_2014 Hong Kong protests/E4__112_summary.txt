Questions have been raised about the credibility of an anti-Occupy Central group's plan to collect signatures from those who oppose the civil disobedience movement after it admitted there were no measures in place to prevent repeat signatures.
"We want to find out how many people object to Occupy Central and want to avoid chaos," group spokesman Robert Chow Yung said yesterday.
There is no measure in place to prevent repeat signatures as people who sign will be asked for only the letter and first four digits of their ID cards.
At least 11 stations will be set up - mostly at the Federation of Trade Unions' branch offices - from July 19 to August 17 to collect signatures against Occupy Central.
Meanwhile, Tourism Board chairman Peter Lam Kin-ngok warned that Occupy Central could harm tourism in the city.
