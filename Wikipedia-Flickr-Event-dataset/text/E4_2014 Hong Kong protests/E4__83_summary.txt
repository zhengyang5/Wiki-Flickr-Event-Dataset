Ken Tsang, a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, is taken away by police.
Li, Asia’s richest man, said that if Hong Kong’s rule of law broke down it would be the city’s “greatest sorrow”.
Hong Kong police officers moved in on pro-democracy protesters who blockaded a road near the city government’s headquarters.
“It is stomach-churning to think there are Hong Kong police officers that feel they are above the law,” Mabel Au, the director of Amnesty Hong Kong, said in a statement.
Professor Joseph Cheng, from the department of politics at Hong Kong’s City University, said the police operation was being seen as the start of a move to end the demonstrations.
