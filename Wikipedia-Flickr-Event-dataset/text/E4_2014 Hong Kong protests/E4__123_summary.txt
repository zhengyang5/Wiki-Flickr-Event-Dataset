Bailiffs successfully cleared a section of the Occupy Central camp in Admiralty this morning as protesters put up little resistance to the enactment of a court order to remove barricades blocking access to Citic Tower.
Watch: Occupy Central protesters show little resistance as bailiffs remove barriers in Admiralty“People should immediately pack their stuff and leave,” the bailiff said, via megaphone.
Anyone who violated the court order could face contempt of court, she added.
They then carried the metal barriers to the main Occupy site on Tim Mei Avenue.
Justice Au reasoned that the protesters had blocked the car park entrance to Citic Tower and two fire exits.
