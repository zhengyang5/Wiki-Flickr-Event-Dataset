PhotoHONG KONG — A Hong Kong lawmaker from a pro-business party that supports Beijing said Friday that the city’s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, should consider resigning.
James Tien, the leader of the conservative Liberal Party, said in an interview with Commercial Radio Hong Kong that under Mr. Leung, the government’s relations with the city’s legislature had deteriorated.
Mr. Leung’s leadership has been poor, and he should consider asking the central government in Beijing if he can resign, Mr. Tien said.
Mr. Leung took office in 2012 for a five-year term.
Mr. Tien could not be reached for comment to elaborate on his position.
