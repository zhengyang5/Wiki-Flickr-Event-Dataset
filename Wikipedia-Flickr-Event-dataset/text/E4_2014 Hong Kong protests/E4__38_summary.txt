Scholarism announced it will organise a one-day class boycott in secondary schools on September 26.
The decision by the student group was to support the class boycott organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Students.
"The federation's class boycott will start on Monday and end on September 26.
Chow stressed that the class boycott is not to encourage students to quit school.
There is a huge amount of pressure on secondary school students to decide whether they should participate in the class boycott, and Chow hopes students will discuss the issue with their parents.
