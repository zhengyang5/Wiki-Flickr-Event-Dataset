HONG KONG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A Chinese official told foreign media in Hong Kong on Wednesday that China has seen interference in the city’s pro-democracy protests from outside forces and called on international journalists to report “objectively”.
It was the first time since the demonstrations, which China and the Hong Kong government have called illegal, that an official from the central government has met foreign media in Hong Kong and made such a request.
Hong Kong is officially a Special Administrative Region of China.
The official added that the central government “firmly supports” Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying, after Hong Kong lawmakers asked the city’s anti-graft agency to investigate Leung over a $6.4 million payment he got from an Australian engineering company while he was in office.
“As for the specific case you have mentioned, the chief executive has made an explanation on that,” the official said.
