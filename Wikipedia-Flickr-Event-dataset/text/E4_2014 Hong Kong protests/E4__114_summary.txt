A top court judge has questioned the "curious" handling of applications for injunctions to clear the Occupy protest site in Mong Kok, and described the orders themselves as "extremely odd".
The Court of First Instance on Monday renewed a temporary injunction granted three weeks earlier against pro-democracy protesters in Nathan Road.
He eventually found the court order, soaked, in a plastic container.
Given their insistence on urgency, Litton said he was "mystified" as to why the plaintiffs had not acted immediately.
Litton said an injunction granted to the owners of an Admiralty tower was different, as it sought to protect property rights.
