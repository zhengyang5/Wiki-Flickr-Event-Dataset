Laura Cha plays ‘black slave’ card against protestersExecutive Council member Laura Cha is comparing the long fight for democracy to the struggle of black slaves who took a hundred years before they won the right to vote.
Tear gas is the simplest and most peaceful deterrent against protesters and is commonly used in many countries, she said.
Explaining her black slave example, Cha said she is not suggesting that Hong Kong wait a hundred years for true democracy.
Civic Party lawmaker Kenneth Chan said Cha insulted Hong Kong people by comparing them with black slaves.
Dixon Sing, an associate professor in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said Cha’s analogy is wrong because Hong Kong people enjoy economic freedom unlike the black slaves.
