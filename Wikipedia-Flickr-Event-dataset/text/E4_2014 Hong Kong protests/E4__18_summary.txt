A boss at HSBC bank has caused fury among Hong Kong democracy protesters after she claimed they should wait to get the right to vote, just like U.S. slaves did.
The chairwoman of the Financial Services Development Council, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, made her incendiary comments, denounced by thousands, at an event in Paris, reports the Hong Kong Standard newspaper.
She said: "American slaves were liberated in 1861 but did not get voting rights until 107 years later.
So why can't Hong Kong wait for a while?"
She added that democracy takes time and Hong Kong needed the confidence of investors.
