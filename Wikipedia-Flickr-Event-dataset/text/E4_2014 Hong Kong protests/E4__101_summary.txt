On Thursday, protesters unfurled a yellow banner saying “I want real universal suffrage” on a mountain known as Lion Rock.
This is the true Lion Rock spirit,” said the man in the video.
Hong Kong protesters have been occupying major parts of Hong Kong for almost one month as they fight for universal suffrage in the 2017 chief executive elections.
Lion Rock, which sits between Kowloon and the New Territories, was named for its resemblance to a lion.
In Hong Kong, the rock is now synonymous with the tenacity and can-do attitude associated with Hong Kong people.
