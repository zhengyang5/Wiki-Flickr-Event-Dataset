TVB footage of ‘police beating protester’ wins journalism awardTVB, Hong Kong’s largest television broadcaster, has won another broadcast journalism award for its exclusive news video footage of police officers apparently beating a pro-democracy protester during last year’s Occupy Movement.
In April this year, the same video won an award in the hard news category at the 2015 Edward E. Murrow Awards.
On the latest award, TVB said the video won against other entries, including those from Britain’s BBC and Canada’s CBC, in view of its “comprehensive, objective and professional” report.
Yuen’s action also led some TVB reporters to quit their jobs, including the reporter who did the voice-over.
TVB assistant news director Wong Suk-ming, who supported Yuen’s move to edit the voice-over report, received the award in Monaco.
