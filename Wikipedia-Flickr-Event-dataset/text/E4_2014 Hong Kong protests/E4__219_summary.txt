BEIJING (Reuters) - China rebuffed a U.N. call for full political rights for Hong Kong on Friday, saying that an international covenant on such rights was not a “measure for reform” in the Chinese-ruled territory.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying acknowledged that the covenant applied to Hong Kong, but said the treaty had no weight in China, adding that China’s decision on Hong Kong elections had “unshakable legal status and effect”.
“The covenant is not a measure for Hong Kong’s political reform,” she added, without elaborating.
It was not immediately clear how, if the covenant applied to Hong Kong, it could have no bearing on its political reform.
Since the protests began, China has consistently decried what it calls outside interference in Hong Kong, saying that as a part of China its politics are a purely internal matter.
