The flags of China (front R) and Hong Kong are seen in front of a large banner that was hung by pro-democracy protesters at Lion Rock, in Hong Kong October 23, 2014.
Thousands have taken to the streets of Hong Kong in protest against central government plans to allow only Beijing loyalists to stand in 2017 elections in which Hong Kong people will vote for their own leader.
The experts were following up on their recommendations made in March 2013 regarding the need for universal and equal suffrage in Hong Kong for all elections.
The problem is that Beijing wants to vet candidates ... We have now put some pressure, but not too heavily, as we absolutely need China’s cooperation.”Emily Lau, a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and chair of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong who attended the Geneva session, welcomed the U.N. watchdog’s stance.
Law Yuk Kai, director of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, an activist group in Hong Kong, said: “The committee rightly pointed to the right to stand and the problem of scrutiny by a vetting committee, which is not representative of the Hong Kong population.”
