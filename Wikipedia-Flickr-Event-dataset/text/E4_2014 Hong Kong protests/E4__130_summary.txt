HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands of pro-democracy activists clashed with police in running scuffles in Hong Kong’s gritty Mong Kok district early on Saturday in a bid to reclaim part of one of the city’s largest and most volatile protest sites.
Several reporters were also roughed up, prompting the Hong Kong Journalists Association to lodge a formal complaint and plan a Saturday protest.

The protests, which have lasted well beyond many people’s expectations, drew more than 100,000 on to the streets of Hong Kong at the peak.
