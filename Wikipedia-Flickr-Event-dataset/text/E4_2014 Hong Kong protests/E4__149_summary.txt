Occupy protests had little impact on HK economy: reportHong Kong’s broader economy doesn’t seem to have suffered any significant damage due to the Occupy protests, although the street blockades may have hurt some retailers, Apple Daily reported Tuesday.
Francis Lui, director of Economics department at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, had estimated that the Occupy movement could lead to a daily economic loss of HK$1.6 billion for Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong Retail Management Association, meanwhile, said in a report that most of their member retailers recorded a single or even double-digit growth in turnover in November.
Economist Andy Kwan Cheuk Chiu was quoted as saying that Occupy had a short-term impact on economy due to traffic blockades, but it was absorbed by the market quickly.
However, the core factor behind instability will be Hong Kong government’s poor governance, and popular discontent stemming from wealth disparity and lack of political reforms, he added.
