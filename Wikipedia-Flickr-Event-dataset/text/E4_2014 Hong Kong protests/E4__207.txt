Mainland activists held for backing HK protesters

At least five activists have been detained in the mainland for supporting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters, the BBC Chinese website reported Tuesday.

One of them was Ding Ding, a Beijing-based artist, who was picked up at his home by a dozen policemen in a midnight raid.

Ding was questioned for his role in organizing an artists’ gathering last week.

The group had planned a poetry reading and a poster exhibit to express their support for events in Hong Kong, the report said.

Police confiscated computers and a camera memory card from the group. They told Ding’s wife to stay on call for 24 hours after his arrest.

Ding is being held in Beijing’s No. 1 Police Detention Center where he has been prevented from seeing his wife.

Four others including poet Wang Zang, artist Cui Guangxia and journalist Zhang Miao are under police custody.

Cui had planned a concert to support Occupy Central but the police shut down the venue before the event could start, the report said.

Meanwhile, 10 people have been charged by Beijing authorities with “disturbing the peace and provoking trouble” after taking photos to support the Hong Kong civil disobedience movement.
