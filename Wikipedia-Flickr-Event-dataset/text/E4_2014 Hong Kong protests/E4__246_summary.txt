HONG KONG: A Hong Kong court ruled Monday (Jan 19) that a 14-year-old girl who was arrested for drawing on a wall used to post pro-democracy messages, could remain in her family's care.
She was later allowed to return to her family on bail and under curfew.
Prominent pro-democracy veteran Martin Lee, who represented the girl, said the teenager, who was not available for comment after the hearing, "should be happy today."
The case sparked outcry from pro-democracy campaigners, and the teen became known as "Chalk Girl" in local media.
Police had also sought a care and protection order for another teenager, a 14-year-old boy who was arrested during the clearance of one of the protest camps in November.
