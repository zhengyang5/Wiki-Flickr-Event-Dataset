The annual rally, marking the day Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, was to demand full electoral freedom.
Amnesty International has called on the Hong Kong authorities to release all who have been detained.
The human rights organisation's Hong Kong director Mabel Au said the protest was a "peaceful and legitimate protest under international law".
Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 following a 1984 agreement between China and Britain.
As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected.
