By 1am, police had pulled back from the crowd and formed a cordon at the junction of Argyle Street and Nathan Road.
Meanwhile, other groups of protesters advanced towards Argyle Street from Sai Yeung Choi South Street, Portland Street and Shanghai Street.
As Mong Kok was plunged into chaos, crowds also started to mill around the edge of Lung Wo Road in Admiralty late on Friday.
Police were forced to close both the north and southbound lanes on a section of Nathan Road in Mong Kok.
Civic Passion founder Wong Yeung-tat said the media had misreported the police operation in Mong Kok this morning.
