But it brought forward the start after tens of thousands of people gathered outside government headquarters to support pro-democracy student activists involved in a tense two-day stand-off with police.
It said in a statement that "The two nights of occupation of Civic Square in Admiralty have completely embodied the awakening of Hong Kong people's desire to decide their own lives.
"The courage of the students and members of the public in their spontaneous decision to stay has touched many Hong Kong people.
Following an all-night stand-off, police arrested 61 people at 1.30pm on Saturday for "forcible entry into government premises and unlawful assembly".
On Friday evening, they arrested several activists, including Joshua Wong, the 17-year-old leader of the pro-democracy Scholarism group.
