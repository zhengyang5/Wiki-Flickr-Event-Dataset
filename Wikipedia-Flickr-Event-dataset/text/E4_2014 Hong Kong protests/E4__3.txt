The group had planned to start its "banquet" – the code name for the protest – on Wednesday. But it brought forward the start after tens of thousands of people gathered outside government headquarters to support pro-democracy student activists involved in a tense two-day stand-off with police.



It said in a statement that "The two nights of occupation of Civic Square in Admiralty have completely embodied the awakening of Hong Kong people's desire to decide their own lives.



"The courage of the students and members of the public in their spontaneous decision to stay has touched many Hong Kong people. Yet the government remained unmoved. As the wheel of time has reached this point, we have decided to arise and act. "



Benny Tai, a co-founder of Occupy Central, shouted "Cheers" in Chinese to the masses of protesters as he announced the start of the so-called banquet.

The move came after crowds streamed into Admiralty, the central district that houses government offices and many five-star hotels, all day ahead of a planned second night of student protests.



Earlier on Saturday, Hong Kong police had arrested dozens of students after two hundred democracy activists stormed government headquarters on Friday evening to protest against a controversial electoral reform plan announced by Beijing last month.



Following an all-night stand-off, police arrested 61 people at 1.30pm on Saturday for "forcible entry into government premises and unlawful assembly". On Friday evening, they arrested several activists, including Joshua Wong, the 17-year-old leader of the pro-democracy Scholarism group.



Police have reportedly searched the home of Mr Wong who has been denied bail. Several other student leaders have also been detained.



Some protesters placed clingfilm over their faces to protect themselves against pepper spray, which police have been using to try to disperse the crowds.
