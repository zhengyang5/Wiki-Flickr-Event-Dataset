Hong Kong’s commuters are sharing crowded subway cars with some rarefied company these days: movie stars.
There’s television star Jessica Hsuan stepping out of the small screen and through the subway doors.
“This has proven you can lock down the city and we can still live our lives,” said Paul Zimmerman, a district counselor who has campaigned for making Hong Kong more pedestrian friendly.
While Zimmerman’s constituents on western Hong Kong Island don’t yet have convenient subway access, he noted that three-quarters of city residents live within a 10-minute walk of an MTR station.
“It’s better to take the subway today,” Hsuan said.
