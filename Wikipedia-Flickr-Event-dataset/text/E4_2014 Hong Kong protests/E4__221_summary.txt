Russian state television has claimed the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are being organised by Britain and the United States.
Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing newspaper, said last week that Joshua Wong, the 17-year-old Hong Kong student leader, had met frequently with US embassy personnel in Hong Kong and received donations from Americans.
Other Kremlin-leaning media are rolling into action to shore up Beijing and cast doubt on the origins of the Hong Kong protests.
Yury Tavrovsky, a China specialist at Moscow's Peoples' Friendship University, told Voice of Russia radio that America was using the Hong Kong protests as a way of putting pressure on Beijing.
“If the Chinese leaders do not squeeze this spot now it will keep on suppurating and then there will be great bloodshed,” he added.
