Ma Ying-jeou marks Taiwan’s National Day by calling on Beijing to ‘convert crisis into opportunity’ by allowing Hong Kong reformsTaiwan’s president, Ma Ying-jeou, has called on Beijing to “let some people go democratic first” as he expressed support for protesters who have paralysed parts of Hong Kong for nearly two weeks.
Taiwan has been watching closely the events in Hong Kong, where democracy activists are planning a fresh show of force on Friday after talks with the city’s government collapsed.
So why couldn’t they do the same thing in Hong Kong, and let some people go democratic first?”Ma said “China would simply be making good on a pledge made 17 years ago, when they said that for 50 years they would allow rule of Hong Kong by the people of Hong Kong, a high degree of autonomy, and election of the chief executive through universal suffrage”.
This would be a “win-win scenario” for both China and Hong Kong, as well as a huge boost for the relations between Taipei and Beijing, Ma added.
Taiwan in particular is concerned about the situation in Hong Kong, as China wants to reunite the island under a similar “one country, two systems” deal.
