Protesters, many holding umbrellas, fall silent for 87 seconds to remember 87 times police fired tear gas a month agoThousands of protesters in Hong Kong rallied Tuesday evening to mark the one-month anniversary of police use of tear gas against demonstrators blocking roads.
With many holding up umbrellas and some wearing workman's goggles, they fell silent for 87 seconds in remembrance of the 87 times police fired tear gas September 28.
The use of the tear gas had shocked the city, prompting thousands more to join the protests.
The rally came as student leaders released an open letter to Chief Secretary Carrie Lam detailing conditions for further talks with the Hong Kong government.
It added that if the Hong Kong government cannot meet their demands, students would like to have talks with China's premier, Li Keqiang.
