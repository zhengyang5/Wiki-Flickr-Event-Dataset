That is the lesson of Hong Kong, where both the local authorities and Beijing have made misstep after misstep.
What China has done in Hong Kong will preserve control but deepen alienation.
Yet the fact that the “one country, two systems” formula has been almost completely discredited by events in Hong Kong is part of the context.
Mr Ma’s criticism of Beijing in a speech last month in which he supported the Hong Kong demonstrators and called for China to move toward constitutional democracy did him no good electorally.
The refusal to allow the British parliament’s foreign affairs select committee to visit Hong Kong is typical of this deeply counterproductive attitude.
