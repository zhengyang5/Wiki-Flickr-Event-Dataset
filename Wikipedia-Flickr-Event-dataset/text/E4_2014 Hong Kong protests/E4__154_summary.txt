THE pro-democracy protests that have gripped Hong Kong since late September have reached an impasse that appears to suit the territory’s government and its backers in Beijing.
The largest proportion, nearly 29%, blamed Mr Leung, whose resignation the protesters have been demanding.
One negotiator-to-be, Lester Shum, denounced the Hong Kong government as “insincere” even as he announced his willingness to talk.
The pro-democracy camp has been riled by a report this week that Mr Leung had received large payments from an Australian engineering firm.
Mr Leung has denied any wrongdoing.
