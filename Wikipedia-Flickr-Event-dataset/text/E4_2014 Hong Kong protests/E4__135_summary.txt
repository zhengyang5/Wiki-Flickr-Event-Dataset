Mong Kok minibus group faces backlash after anti-Occupy moveChiu Luen Public Light Bus is facing a backlash after it secured a restraining order from the court to stop protesters from occupying roads in the shopping district of Mong Kok.
Internet activist group Passion Times reported that at least one of its minibuses received a parking ticket from a traffic warden in Mong Kok on Monday morning.
One netizen said he would rather walk than ride on a Chiu Luen minibus.
Chiu Luen was founded in 1968 by a group of minibus drivers who came from Chiu Chow in eastern Guangdong province.
Unlike the green minibus, Chiu Luenâ€™s red minibus lines offer non-scheduled services.
