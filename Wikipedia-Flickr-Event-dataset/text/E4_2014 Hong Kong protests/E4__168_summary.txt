HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters plan to hold a straw poll on government proposals they rejected earlier in the week as their street campaign pushing for democracy for the Chinese-controlled city entered its fifth week on Friday.
Pro-democracy protesters point and scuffle with a man holding a Chinese flag who came to the protesters' barricade to oppose them blocking roads at Mongkok shopping district in Hong Kong October 24, 2014.
It was not immediately clear how, if the covenant applied to Hong Kong, it could have no bearing on its political reform.
A chasm exists between the Hong Kong government and the protesters who have also been calling for the current leader, Leung Chun-ying, to step down.
The government branded the movementâ€™s occupation of streets illegal and has repeatedly said open nominations are not allowed under Hong Kong laws.
