With a high-profile international summit hosted by President Xi Jinping this month behind them, they are ready for authorities in Hong Kong to crack down on a pro-democracy protest movement.
“Tuesday’s police action demonstrated the rule of law in action,” crowed the Hong Kong edition of the official organ China Daily.
Though Mr. Obama spoke up for the cause of Hong Kong democracy while in Beijing, the administration has been at pains to avoid conflict over the issue.
Similarly, polls show that while the protest movement is popular, a majority of Hong Kong’s residents want the street closures and traffic headaches to end.
Still, even if its clearing operations go smoothly, China is losing the larger contest over Hong Kong.
