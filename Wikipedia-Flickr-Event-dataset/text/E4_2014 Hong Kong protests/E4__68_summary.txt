Former judicial and political heavyweights, the heads of five universities, leaders of religious and business groups and even some who sided with the protesters showed unprecedented unity yesterday in calling for an end to the demonstrations that have gripped Hong Kong for more than a week.
They were among about 20 parties, including former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, two retired chief justices - Yang Ti-liang and Andrew Li Kwok-nang - former chief secretary and 2012 executive candidate Henry Tang Ying-yen and non-official members of the Executive Council to make such calls yesterday.
"The only way forward is dialogue," Hong Kong 2020 said.
Tang said: "I call on students and other protesters to withdraw immediately to ensure their personal safety.
Dialogue and communication is the way to resolve different views in a diverse civil society."
