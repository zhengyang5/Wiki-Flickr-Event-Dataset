Democracy activist Ken Tsang has applied to the District Court for punitive damages from the police chief after he was beaten by officers during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests.
Tsang was punched and kicked by seven officers, and was later slapped twice on his face inside Central Police Station.
“The court has found [the seven police officers] guilty so we decided to take action,” Jonathan Man, Tsang’s lawyer, told HKFP.
“The injuries, loss and damages were caused by assault and/or torture and/or negligence and/or breach of statutory duty and/or breach of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance on the part of the Defendant,” the writ reads.
The appeal of police chief inspector Wong Cho-shing, one of the seven jailed police officers, will be heard on November 23.
