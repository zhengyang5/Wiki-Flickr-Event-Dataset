Former Hong Kong chief secretary Anson Chan said that Britain has a "legal and moral responsibility" to stand by Hong Kong as tensions continue to rise there.
The 74-year-old, who served under Hong Kong's last British governor, Chris Patten, said that people in Hong Kong have been "disappointed" by Britain's silence on the matter.
Quite frankly, Hong Kong people despair that Britain will ever stand by Hong Kong and that's a real pity.
"Britain has a legal and moral responsibility towards Hong Kong and we have a perfect right to expect Britain to act in an honourable way.
"This latest show of discontent has been entirely generated within Hong Kong and it is the government's doing," she said.
