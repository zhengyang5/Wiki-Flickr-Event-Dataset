HONG KONG (Reuters) - A small group of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters broke into the city’s legislature via a side door early on Wednesday, and police stopped others forcing their way in as tensions in the Chinese-controlled city escalated following a period of calm.
Pro-democracy protesters are pepper sprayed by a policeman as they try to break into the Legislative Council in Hong Kong early November 19, 2014, in response to an earlier clear up by bailiffs on part of the "Occupy Central" protest site.

Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that gives the city more autonomy and freedom than the mainland, with an eventual goal of universal suffrage.
The protesters are demanding open nominations in the city’s next election for chief executive in 2017.
