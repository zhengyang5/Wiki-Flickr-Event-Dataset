The intervention is beyond what is normal for the usually free-talking Hong Kong, even as people are used to Chinese censors scrubbing the Internet in the mainland when mass demonstrations erupt.
Chinese websites, including Baidu Inc’s (BIDU.O) search engine and the Twitter-like Weibo Corp (WB.O) microblog, have set about deleting references to the Hong Kong demonstrations.
Others in Hong Kong were still using WeChat, but had noted signs of censorship.
“I forwarded an article (on Hong Kong) on today and it was deleted.
“All my friends ... know what’s happening in Hong Kong,” said Jennie in Hong Kong.
