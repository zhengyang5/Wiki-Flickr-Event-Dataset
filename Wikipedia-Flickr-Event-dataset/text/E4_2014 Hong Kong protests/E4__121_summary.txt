HONG KONG - An outspoken Hong Kong pro-democracy media mogul was attacked on Wednesday by a group of men who threw bags of rotten animal organs at him, according to his spokesman and witnesses.
I think it was three guys," his spokesman, Mark Simon, told AFP adding that 66-year-old Lai had escaped unhurt.
Fears over the erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong have grown following attacks on journalists earlier this year.
Former editor of liberal newspaper, Ming Pao, Kevin Lau, was stabbed in broad daylight by two men in February.
Several major roads have been blocked for more than six weeks by pro-democracy protesters calling for fully free elections for the city's leader in 2017.
