BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s censors, who have barred most online discussion of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, have so far not blocked searches for the movement’s “Umbrella Revolution” nickname, although it may not survive much longer.
Chinese Internet users were still able to post under the hashtag “Umbrella Revolution” in Chinese and English on Sina Weibo, China’s popular Twitter-like microblogging service, on Monday and Tuesday.
Another said: “Let BJ see the light #umbrella revolution#”, in an apparent reference to Beijing.
It was unclear why the “Umbrella Revolution” search remained open on Sina Weibo while it was blocked on Tencent Weibo, another popular microblogging service.
Chinese media has largely limited its coverage of the Hong Kong protests to government condemnations and state-run media has published few photos of the protests.
