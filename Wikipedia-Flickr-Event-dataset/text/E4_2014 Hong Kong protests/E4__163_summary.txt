Amidst the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the future of Hong Kong's political state, is a slant of sun when it comes to freedom of press -- social media.
Facebook in particular has played a major role in extending Hong Kong's protests beyond its borders.
This is good news considering the dark cloud that looms over Hong Kong's future.
The pro-democracy group, who believe that Hong Kong's cultural identity and independence is being threatened by mainland China, publishes a monthly newspaper called Passion Times and also runs an online news website called "Passion Times."
Other alternative media have used social media and websites to organize the movement.
