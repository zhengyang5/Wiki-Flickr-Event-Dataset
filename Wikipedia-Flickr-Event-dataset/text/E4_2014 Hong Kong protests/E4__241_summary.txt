The police have called off their bid to apply for a child protection order for a 14-year-old boy arrested during the Occupy Mong Kok clearance operation, weeks after their attempts to separate another underage activist from her legal custodian were called into question.
A care and protection order is usually used for children in dangerous circumstances, such as those facing the risk of drug addiction or abuse.
The department said that, given the evidence and the decision to dispose of the case, "a care and protection order was no longer necessary and hence it was withdrawn".
The police have recently come under intense fire after they attempted to seek the same type of order, usually used on delinquent teens, for a 14-year-old who has come to be known as the "chalk girl".
Ho, who previously called the ruling "disproportionate", noted that both youngsters were never charged.
