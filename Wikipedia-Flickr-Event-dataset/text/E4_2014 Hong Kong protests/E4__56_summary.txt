As the civil disobedience movement entered a second day on Monday, logos for the "umbrella revolution" or "umbrella movement" began spreading on social media.
Angelo Costadimas, a Hong Kong-based artist, filmmaker and educator, envisioned a man holding up two umbrellas standing against a yellow banner in his design for "Umbrella Revolution".
He said the yellow colour came from the yellow ribbons the students have been using as a symbol of democracy.
Meanwhile, artist Tania Willis created a colourful Umbrella Movement artwork showing a girl in yellow, holding an umbrella against a cascade of stars, from a cloud that looks like the Chinese national flag.
More logos and riffs on the movement have been being shared on social media since Sunday evening.
