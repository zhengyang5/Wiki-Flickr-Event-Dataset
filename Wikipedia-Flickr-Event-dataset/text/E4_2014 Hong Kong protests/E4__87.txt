Democracy activist Ken Tsang has applied to the District Court for punitive damages from the police chief after he was beaten by officers during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests.

The high-profile attack took place near the government headquarters in Tamar Park, Admiralty on October 15, 2014. Tsang was punched and kicked by seven officers, and was later slapped twice on his face inside Central Police Station.

The seven police officers were sentenced to two years jail in February. All of them have been released on bail pending appeals.

“The court has found [the seven police officers] guilty so we decided to take action,” Jonathan Man, Tsang’s lawyer, told HKFP. “It is difficult to say whether we will win, but there’s a fair chance because of the criminal record.”

Tsang filed the case against the secretary for justice – on behalf of the police commissioner – on the deadline for civil action on Friday.

“The injuries, loss and damages were caused by assault and/or torture and/or negligence and/or breach of statutory duty and/or breach of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance on the part of the Defendant,” the writ reads.

The 2014 assault incident came after Tsang poured liquid over police officers. Tsang was sentenced to five weeks of imprisonment for assaulting police and resisting arrest. He has completed the sentence.

The appeal of police chief inspector Wong Cho-shing, one of the seven jailed police officers, will be heard on November 23.
