HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands have signed an online petition denouncing reported comments by an HSBC Holdings board member in which she likened Hong Kong protestersâ€™ demands for democracy to the emancipation of slaves.
The web site of the petition said it had been launched by Jeffrey Chan from Hong Kong.
The petition is addressed to the HSBC board of directors and is signed "The People of Hong Kong".
The controversy is the latest to drag HSBC into Hong Kong politics.
Financial Secretary John Tsang is due to visit Beijing on Monday to discuss issues of mutual concern, the Hong Kong government said late on Friday.
