Government's response to dialogue with HKFS*******************************************

The Task Force on Constitutional Development of the HKSAR Government today (October 21), with utmost sincerity, had a two-hour candid and meaningful dialogue with representatives of the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS). The Government also gave a four-point response positively and proactively.



The HKSAR Government is disappointed to learn of the HKFS' comment that the Government's response was not a concrete one.
