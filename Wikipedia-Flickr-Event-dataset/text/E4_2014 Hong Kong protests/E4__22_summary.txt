Police said in a Sunday statement they had used "minimum force" as protesters approached their cordon lines.
They said protesters had attempted to charge police cordon lines by pulling aside barriers and shoving officers, but confirmed three protesters and an officer were injured.
Over the weekend pepper spray was used on protesters who retook ground that police had cleared for traffic.
A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" deal that guarantees freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and the right to protest.
