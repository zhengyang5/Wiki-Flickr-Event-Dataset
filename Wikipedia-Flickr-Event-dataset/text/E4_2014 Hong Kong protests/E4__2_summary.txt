In the latest wave of protests in the Asian financial hub, a group of Chinese demonstrators on Thursday unfurled a huge banner on Hong Kong's famous "Lion Rock," which overlooks many poor neighborhoods across the region's harbor.
The stunt came following comments made by Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying on Monday when he claimed that full democracy would give the poor too much power.
'Lion Rock Spirit'Associated with "Lion Rock" is the concept of "Lion Rock Spirit" - a phrase which has been adopted by Cantonese speakers to encapsulate Hong Kong's reputation as a place where hard work and perseverance meant a brighter future.
However, many among Hong Kong's youth feel that the city's "Lion Rock Spirit" has been stifled by the political elite.
Pro-democracy campaigners have now been protesting in Hong Kong for almost a month, where they continue to demand a free choice of candidates to become the city's chief executive in the 2017 election.
