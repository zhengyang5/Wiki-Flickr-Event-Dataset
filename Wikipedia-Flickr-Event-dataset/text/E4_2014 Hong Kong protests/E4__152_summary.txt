Here’s who really suffered in Hong Kong:Hong Kong TramwaysThe regular routes of Hong Kong’s iconic trams, known as “ding-dings,” carry them right through the main protest site at Admiralty, as well as the smaller Causeway Bay site, so the company was forced to abbreviate its routes.
That meant 36% fewer passengers for the month of October, the company told Quartz, for a total loss of 2.3 million riders.
The entire Occupy Central movement cost the company about $1 million, the company estimated at the end of November, and regular service wasn’t fully restored until December 15.
The shops in Pacific Place MallThis glitzy mall that abuts the now-cleared main protest site counts Harvey Nichols, Montblanc, Burberry and L’Occitane among it tenants.
The damage, collectively, is nowhere near the $5 billion that mainland China’s state-backed newspapers were predicting when the protests first started.
