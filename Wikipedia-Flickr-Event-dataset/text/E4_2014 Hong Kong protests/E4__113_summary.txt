Lam’s remarks to reporters came a day after Hong Kong’s high court extended injunctions requiring protesters to leave two of the three protest sites while also authorising bailiffs to seek police assistance to clear the areas.
She urged protesters to “voluntarily and peacefully” leave the occupied areas so that roads and building entrances could be reopened.
On Monday, a judge extended interim restraining orders taken out three weeks ago by bus, minibus and taxi operators against protesters blocking streets in Hong Kong’s densely populated Mong Kok district.
Previous police attempts to clear protesters from occupied areas with force have backfired, drawing more demonstrators on to the streets and forcing authorities to back off.
An earlier version said that Carrie Lam is acting chief secretary rather than acting chief executive.
