HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong pro-democracy protest leaders said they would unblock access to government buildings to allow civil servants to go back to work next week, but defied calls from the Chinese-controlled city’s leaders to end their demonstrations.
BACKLASHThe protests brought much of Hong Kong to a standstill during what is traditionally a busy week-long shopping holiday.
China’s ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, in a front page editorial on Saturday, said the Hong Kong protests would never spill over into the rest of China.
“For the minority of people who want to foment a ‘colour revolution’ on the mainland by way of Hong Kong, this is but a daydream,” the newspaper said.
Facing separatist unrest in far-flung and resource-rich Tibet and Xinjiang, Beijing is standing firm on Hong Kong, fearful that calls for democracy there could spread to the mainland.
