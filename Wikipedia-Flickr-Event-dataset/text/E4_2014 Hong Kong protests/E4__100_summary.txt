The banner, which last night remained hanging from the cliff face of Lion Rock - a symbol of Hong Kong's "can-do" spirit.
The four abseilers followed up a first video of the unfurling action with Up On the Lion Rock: Behind the Scenes last night on YouTube.
It included the unofficial anthem of the democracy movement Boundless Sea and Sky by 1980s' rock band Beyond.
After hiking to the top, the team - which included a woman - buckled up their harnesses, put on their helmets and abseiled down Lion Rock with the huge banner.
Two remained suspended near the top of the banner while one of the group was beneath to help unfurl it and secure it in place.
