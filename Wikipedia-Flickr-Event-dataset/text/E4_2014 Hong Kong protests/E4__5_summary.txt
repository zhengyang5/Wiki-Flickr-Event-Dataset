Huge cyberattacks in the past few months were triggered by political events and involved hackers sympathetic to both the city's main political camps, a University of Hong Kong study has found.
The academic behind the study said one attack on democracy supporters involved up to 10,000 computers around the world.
Attacks on the government were less sophisticated but were "destructive and difficult to avoid", said Dr Chow Kam-pui, an associate professor of computer science.
Chow said his study identified sudden spikes in cyberattacks aimed at stealing the personal information of people involved in last year's Occupy Central pro-democracy protests, and in attacks on government websites.
Hackers made several attempts to plant spy programmes on the smartphones and computers of Occupy protesters, Chow said.
