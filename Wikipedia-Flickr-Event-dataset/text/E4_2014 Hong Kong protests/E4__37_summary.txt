Black Means Indignation in Hong Kong, as Thousands Demand Universal Suffrage4000 supporters of Hong Kong’s Occupy Central movement participated in the Black Cloth March wearing black shirts and yellow ribbons, and holding 450 meters of black banners, in central Hong Kong on Sept. 14, 2014.
The black, according to Occupy Central organizer Benny Tai, “represents our indignation.” The yellow ribbons represent the Hong Kong people’s demand for universal suffrage.
The protesters included Occupy Central organizers, democratic politicians, various civil groups, students, and Hong Kong citizens.
Starting at 3:30 p.m., the protesters wended their way from Causeway Bay to Charter Road in central Hong Kong, walking for about 3 hours.
At their destination they held a rally calling for more Hong Kong citizens to join the democratic movement.
