HONG KONG: A senior pro-China lawmaker Wednesday (Oct 29) disputed allegations foreign forces are behind Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, contradicting claims by the city's leader and Beijing.
"Unless you treat foreign diplomats expressing concerns as an intervention by external forces.
Beijing has refused to back down over what has become the most serious challenge to Chinese rulers since a crackdown on a pro-democracy movement in 1989 in the nation's capital.
Embattled Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said earlier this month that "external forces" from other countries had been encouraging the mass sit-ins, but refused to identify them.
Commentaries on the mainland have also increasingly described the Hong Kong protests as a "colour revolution" - a term used by Beijing for political movements funded by international forces.
