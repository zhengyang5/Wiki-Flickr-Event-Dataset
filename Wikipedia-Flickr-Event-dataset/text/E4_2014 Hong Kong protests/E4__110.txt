HONG KONG — China’s top advisory body expelled a Hong Kong delegate on Wednesday for giving the wrong kind of advice: that the top official in the city should resign because of what the delegate called the poor way he has handled student-led protests.

The delegate, James Tien, was removed from the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the official China News Service reported. The body, a largely powerless but prestigious organ of the Chinese government, moved quickly to remove Mr. Tien, one of more than 2,000 delegates, after he said on Friday in a radio interview that Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying should resign.

In remarks to reporters in Hong Kong after the vote by the body’s standing committee, Mr. Tien said he accepted the decision and he was resigning his post as leader of the city’s pro-business Liberal Party.
