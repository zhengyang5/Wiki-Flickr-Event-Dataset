HONG KONG—Beijing has a harshly worded message for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement.
Today’s People’s Daily editorial (link in Chinese, our English translation here) says the Beijing stance on Hong Kong’s elections are “unshakable” and legally valid.
It goes on to argue that the pro-democracy “Occupy Central” protests are illegal and are hurting Hong Kong.
But the People’s Daily editorial carries more weight, appearing as it did first in the official government newspaper—though there is plenty of debate among China-watchers on this.
They have incited the public, paralyzed transportation, disrupted businesses…and interfered with the daily lives of Hong Kong people.
