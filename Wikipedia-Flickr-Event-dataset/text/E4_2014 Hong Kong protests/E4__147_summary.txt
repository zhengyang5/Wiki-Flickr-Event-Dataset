HONG KONG – Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong agreed with the city’s government late on Tuesday to start formal talks later this week to address concerns that have brought tens of thousands of people onto the city’s streets.
The Communist Party leadership has dismissed the Hong Kong protests as illegal and has left the city’s Beijing-appointed leader Leung to find a solution.
Traffic jams on Hong Kong Island and across Victoria Harbour in Kowloon stretched back miles (km) in some places.
Many Hong Kong businesses were already struggling before the latest demonstrations, a monthly survey by HSBC and Markit Group showed on Tuesday.
The protests have helped wipe close to $50 billion off the value of shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
