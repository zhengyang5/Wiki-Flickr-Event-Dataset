HONG KONG: A Hong Kong court ruled Monday (Jan 19) that a 14-year-old girl who was arrested for drawing on a wall used to post pro-democracy messages, could remain in her family's care.

Authorities had been seeking a "care and protection" order for the teenager, which could have seen her taken away from her deaf father, in a case which has sparked concern over the targeting of minors by the authorities.

The girl had been sent to a children's home after being arrested in December for chalking a flower on the "Lennon Wall" - used by protesters to post notes of support for the pro-democracy movement during two months of rallies for fully free leadership elections. She was later allowed to return to her family on bail and under curfew.

"After considering the facts and based on suggestions made by social workers, there is no need to make such an order now," magistrate Winnie Lau said Monday. Prominent pro-democracy veteran Martin Lee, who represented the girl, said the teenager, who was not available for comment after the hearing, "should be happy today."

The case sparked outcry from pro-democracy campaigners, and the teen became known as "Chalk Girl" in local media. Police had also sought a care and protection order for another teenager, a 14-year-old boy who was arrested during the clearance of one of the protest camps in November.

However that case was dropped earlier this month and the secondary school student expressed anger at his treatment, calling it "extremely unethical" and "politically motivated". "What the government is doing is below the belt because they are using all means to try to stop young people from carrying out political campaigns. But it will just make us more determined," he told AFP after the decision.
