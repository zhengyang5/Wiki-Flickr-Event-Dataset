Mainland activists held for backing HK protestersAt least five activists have been detained in the mainland for supporting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters, the BBC Chinese website reported Tuesday.
One of them was Ding Ding, a Beijing-based artist, who was picked up at his home by a dozen policemen in a midnight raid.
The group had planned a poetry reading and a poster exhibit to express their support for events in Hong Kong, the report said.
Ding is being held in Beijing’s No.
Meanwhile, 10 people have been charged by Beijing authorities with “disturbing the peace and provoking trouble” after taking photos to support the Hong Kong civil disobedience movement.
