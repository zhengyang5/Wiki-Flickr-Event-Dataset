RFA journalists have interviewed protest leaders, Hong Kong legislators, and students who were hit with tear gas and pepper spray, and shop owners who were affected by the protests.
RFA interviews include human rights activists in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hunan detained or arrested because of their support for the Hong Kong protests.
In addition, RFA reports feature listener feedback in the Tibetan and Uyghur regions that have faced similar crackdowns inside China.
Viewers in China tuned in to the VOA Weishi channel and saw Hong Kong legislators such as Albert Ho, Leung Kwok-hung and Martin Lee discussing their views as well as warnings from the Hong Kong finance chief of dire economic consequences of the street protests.
VOA Chinese alone has produced more than 100 reports and 44 videos in its coverage of the movement.
