BEIJING (AFP) - China admonished the last British governor of Hong Kong on Wednesday, after he called on London to do more to encourage democracy in the former colony.
"As the last governor marking the end of the UK's colonial rule over Hong Kong, he should know better and see clearly that the times have changed."
The protestors in Hong Kong are calling for free leadership elections in 2017, when universal suffrage has been promised.
Patten was testifying before parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, which is looking into Britain's relations with Hong Kong 30 years after the Joint Declaration, the agreement that outlined the city's return to Chinese sovereignty.
"Hong Kong affairs are China's domestic affairs; no foreign government or individual has the right to interfere in Hong Kong affairs in any way," Hong said.
