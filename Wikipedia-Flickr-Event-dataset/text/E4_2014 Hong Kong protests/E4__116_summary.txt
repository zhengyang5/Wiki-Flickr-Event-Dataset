Hundreds of yellow ribbons were tied outside the central government's outpost in Hong Kong yesterday after democracy campaigners marched from Central to the liaison office in Sai Wan.
Many carried yellow umbrellas and ribbons, two key symbols of the Occupy campaign.
The marchers faced a counter-protest by about 20 people from the Defend Hong Kong Campaign.
The group urged those taking part in the Occupy movement to turn themselves in to police and accused them of destroying the rule of law.
Meanwhile, a group of Occupy activists released the results of a survey of over 1,300 people in the occupied area of Admiralty.
