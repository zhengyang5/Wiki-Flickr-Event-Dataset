The Joint Declaration and subsequent Basic Law enshrined a high degree of autonomy and basic rights and freedoms for the people of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in China.
As co-signatory of the Joint Declaration, the UK retains an enduring commitment to Hong Kong following the transfer of sovereignty in 1997.
Since then, the Foreign Secretary has reported to Parliament at six-monthly intervals on the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
The UK also has long-term social and economic links with Hong Kong with regular exchanges on policy issues including global economic developments, climate change, financial services regulation, legal and judicial cooperation, and religious and social development.
The Foreign Affairs Committee is launching an inquiry into The UKâ€™s relations with Hong Kong: 30 years after the Joint Declaration, and invites submissions of evidence and possible recommendations.
