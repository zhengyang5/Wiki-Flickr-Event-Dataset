The streets of Central and Admiralty descended into chaos last night after police in riot gear fired tear gas at protesters as the Occupy Central campaign, a movement that promised "peace and love", escalated.
Thousands of protesters, despite police use of pepper spray, batons and tear gas, occupied the main roads outside the government headquarters complex in Admiralty.
Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, who supports the Occupy Central campaign, said: "We do not want to see anyone get hurt."
One protester, 13-year-old Matthew Chau, said: "I can't believe police would resort to tear gas â€¦ My eyes hurt so bad."
Police chief Andy Tsang Wai-hung defended the use of tear gas, saying police had a responsibility to "resume social order".
