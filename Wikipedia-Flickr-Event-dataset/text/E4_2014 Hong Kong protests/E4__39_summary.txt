HONG KONGâ€”Student groups in Hong Kong plan to boycott classes if China's top legislative body rules out the public ability to nominate candidates for the former British colony's chief executive.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is expected to announce a framework for Hong Kong's political reform on August 31.
The end of August has long been targeted by democratic activists for street protests.
