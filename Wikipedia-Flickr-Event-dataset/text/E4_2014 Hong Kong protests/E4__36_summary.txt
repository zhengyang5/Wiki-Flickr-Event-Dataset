Hong Kong police on Monday night arrested 19 people protesting Beijing’s decision to vet candidates for elections to be held in 2017, the South China Morning Post reported.
The protesters were reportedly arrested for illegal assembly and obstructing police outside the hotel where a senior Chinese official was staying.
Protests had erupted in Hong Kong on Monday when activists from the Occupy Central protest group announced their decision to start a campaign of civil disobedience over Beijing’s decision to screen candidates for the election of the next chief executive in 2017.
However, Chinese officials announced Sunday that candidates would need the support of more than 50 percent of a nominating committee to contest the elections.
The UK had, in July, announced its intention to investigate the progress made by Hong Kong in the 30 years since its handover to China was agreed in 1984, BBC reported.
