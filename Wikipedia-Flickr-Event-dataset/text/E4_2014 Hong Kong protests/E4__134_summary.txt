Traffic may have returned to the Mong Kok protest zone, but last week's clearance of the encampment has given rise to a new form of protest known as the "shopping tour", with activists taking to the crowded footpaths to convey their political message.
Watch: Dozens of Occupy supporters stage "shopping tour" protests in Mong Kok after site clearanceBefore the "tour" starts, the air fills with cries of gau wu, a Cantonese transliteration of Putonghua's gou wu, which means "to shop".
Indeed, one of the favourite slogans of the "shoppers" is "let us occupy Mong Kok together with the police".
But shops along the gau wu tour route do not seem to welcome the "shoppers".
Police have taken dozens of people into custody since the gau wu tour started last week.
