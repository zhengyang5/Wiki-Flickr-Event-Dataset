David Cameron was criticised by China after saying it was important for the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the freedoms promised to them.
Patten told a British inquiry into Hong Kong’s democratic timetable: “When China asserts that what is happening in Hong Kong is nothing to do with us we should make it absolutely clear publicly and privately that that is not the case.
[It] is the Joint Declaration, not the Chinese declaration,” he said.
He said he believed China’s moves were in breach of Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
“Without throwing verbal hand grenades we could actually have made it plain that we thought what was happening in Hong Kong was, to put it blandly, extremely unwise,” he said.
