"Because Taiwan's occupy movement was successful, Hong Kong people felt it was also possible for them," said Mr Lai.
Many Hong Kong students came here then to learn, including how to disseminate information online in timely manner and co-ordinate supplies and donations.

"They will have to figure out how to reassure Taiwan to not to support Hong Kong," said Mr Ding.
