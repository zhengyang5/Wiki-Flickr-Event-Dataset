HONG KONG: The vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference on Sunday (Oct 5) said he has heard the demands of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and urged them to abandon their posts for safety reasons.
“We’ve heard clearly your demands for democracy,” said Tung Chee-hwa, who is also the city’s former chief executive.
“Just like many parents and teachers in Hong Kong, I have been worried about the students’ safety.
Earlier on Sunday, clashes broke out in Mong Kok district, with riot police using batons and pepper spray to fight back the protesters.
Hong Kong’s security chief Lai Tung-kwok has denied the claims, saying they are “made up” and “very excessive”.
