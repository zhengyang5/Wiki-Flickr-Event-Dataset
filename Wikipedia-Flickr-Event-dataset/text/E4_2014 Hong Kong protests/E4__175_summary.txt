Photos shared on Weibo, a microblogging platform similar to Twitter, also seem to be hidden if they contain certain keywords.
Searches for phrases like "Occupy Central" and "Hong Kong students" are blocked, says the BBC's Beijing bureau.
The Occupy Central movement and students in Hong Kong are leading the protest.
Instagram told the BBC it was aware of the reports and was looking into the situation.
"However, the decision to block Instagram, a relatively popular photo-sharing application, takes the attempt to manage communications around the Hong Kong protests one step further, revealing Beijing's fears that some in mainland China might be inspired by activists in Hong Kong."
