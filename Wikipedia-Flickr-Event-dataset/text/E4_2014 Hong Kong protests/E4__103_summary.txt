A team of firefighters and mountain rescuers has removed a huge pro-democracy banner for safety reasons, a day after it was hung from the highest point of Lion Rock, above Wong Tai Sin.
"Anywhere that we can hang up a banner of 'We want true universal suffrage' is our 'Lion Rock'."
After 11am, a Government Flying Service helicopter flew eight firefighters and five Civil Aid Service mountain rescue officers to the site.
Lion Rock is a famous landmark that can be easily seen on both sides of Victoria Harbour.
Many in the city associate the "Lion Rock Spirit" with striving for a better life - as embodied in 1970s RTHK drama Under the Lion Rock and its title song.
