Pro-democracy student activists have proposed a way to trigger a referendum on political reform – by having pan-democrat lawmakers resign in order to prompt a by-election.
Chow said his group was discussing the idea with pan-democrats, and some legislators had agreed so far, including League of Social Democrats chairman Leung Kwok-hung.
Chow, of HKFS, said their proposal for a by-election would echo a de facto referendum in 2010 in which all citizens could participate.
If the legislators would be re-elected, they would see it as a signal of public support for "genuine" political reform.
The Democratic Party negotiated with the central government’s local liaison office and voted for an amended reform package, which was later passed.
