VideoRepresentatives of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters have agreed to hold formal talks with the government.
No date has been set but the students made it clear the talks would be called off if the remaining demonstrators were cleared from the streets by force.
Many protesters have now gone home, after a weekend of clashes and accusations that the authorities colluded with triads - organised criminal gangs - to attack the protesters.
Students have accused the police of failing to protect them.
Gabriel Gatehouse, reporting for BBC Newsnight on Monday, has heard independent evidence of triad involvement.
