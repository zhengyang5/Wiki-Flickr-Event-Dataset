BEIJING (AFP) - The BBC's website was blocked in China on Wednesday, one day after a video of Hong Kong police beating and kicking a pro-democracy protester began circulating online.
"Mr Charlie Smith, a co-founder of the anti-censorship group GreatFire.org, confirmed that the broadcaster's website was blocked in China on Wednesday.
The blocking of BBC's website comes as a video of Hong Kong police beating a pro-democracy protester went viral on the Internet.
TVB's website remains accessible in mainland China, although Chinese-language links to reports on the video have been blocked.
CNN's website was also not blocked on Wednesday, even though the Hong Kong police brutality video was the top item on the broadcaster's home page.
