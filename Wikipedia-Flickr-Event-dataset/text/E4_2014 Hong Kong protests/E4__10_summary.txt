Hong Kong needs to address an "unreasonable" imbalance in the nominating committee for the 2017 chief executive election, a Beijing legal scholar told the Sunday Morning Post.
Professor Chen Duanhong of Peking University's law school also said there was room for talks on giving more people a stake in choosing the nominating committee.
Sources said the NPC was likely to require the nominating committee to be modelled on the 1,193-person Election Committee that nominated and elected Leung Chun-ying two years ago.
All the 70 members of the Legislative Council sit on the Election Committee.
Apart from the nominating committee's composition, Chen said Hong Kong should also discuss how to improve voters' participation.
