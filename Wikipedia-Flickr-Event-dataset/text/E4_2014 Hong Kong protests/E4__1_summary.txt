Prosecution in open court would be another opportunity for us to explain to all Hong Kong people the goals and underlying reasons for the acts of civil disobedience we have committed.
But the most powerful weapon in winning democracy for Hong Kong is the people of the Umbrella Generation.
Compared with the previous generations of Hong Kong democrats, the young people of today are more aggressive, flexible, creative and much tougher.
These young people grew up in a vastly different Hong Kong from that of their elders, who were raised with much less prosperity and security.
Even if the Hong Kong government can successfully force the end of the occupation, it will still have to face the demands of the Umbrella Generation in the years to come.
