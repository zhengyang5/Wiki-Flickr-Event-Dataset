A large contingent of local taxi and lorry drivers, angered by the movement’s impact on the city’s transportation network, joined the crowd of counter-demonstrators in Admiralty, a usually-bustling district in downtown Hong Kong and the movement’s de facto core.
Protesters at Admiralty have replaced some of the barriers and fortified them with cement-filled buckets and elaborate bamboo frames, according to pictures posted online.
Mainland authorities have censored discussions of the movement online and detained dozens of people for openly supporting the protesters.
On Monday, the official newswire Xinhua said people from “every group in Hong Kong society” had called for the protesters to disperse “as soon as possible”.
