HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters regrouped in central Hong Kong on Friday to push their demand for democracy, a day after the government called off talks with students amid a two-week standoff that has shaken communist China’s capitalist hub.
The political crisis has seen tens of thousands take to the city streets to push for free elections and seek the resignation of Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying.
In an annual report to U.S. Congress, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China said Washington should boost support for democracy and universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
“I am sure the people of Hong Kong and the government of Hong Kong have the competency to ensure the wealth and stability of society,” he said.
Pro-democracy protesters argue with a man as he walks away from an area blocked by protesters outside the government headquarters office in Hong Kong, October 9, 2014.
