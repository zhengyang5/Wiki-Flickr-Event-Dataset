The two students and 29 others were barred from going to the same area of Mong Kok bordered by Fa Yuen Street, Dundas Street, Shanghai Street and Mong Kok Street after appearing at the Kowloon City Magistrates Court yesterday.
He said banning them from Mong Kok was unreasonable as there were no mo re bailiffs and traffic has resumed.
Barrister Hector Pun Hei for Cheung Ka-hang, a sound engineer working in a university, likened the Mong Kok ban to a cha chaan teng restaurant fight.
Pun said: "If there is a fight inside a cha chaan teng, those people should not be allowed to enter the cha chaan teng again in case they fight again."
He pointed out that, even when Nathan Road was cleared, some people still went back to Mong Kok.
