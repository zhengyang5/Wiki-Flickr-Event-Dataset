Chaos continued to reign in Mong Kok yesterday as a group of angry anti-Occupy Central protesters stormed a pro-democracy camp, dismantling barricades and attacking people, among them a prominent pro-democracy activist.
At least three of the anti-Occupy group were taken away by the police, who later said six people were arrested for common assault in Mong Kok.
Gladys Li SC, representing protester Fok Wai-pong in the Mong Kok cases, said applicants might seek to clear the obstructions themselves if the order were to extend over the weekend.
"No one wishes to see the outbreak of serious violence in Mong Kok," Li said.
Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Steven Hui Wai-tak reiterated that Mong Kok had become increasingly dangerous.
