Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters girded themselves for an anticipated showdown with police who earlier used chain saws and sledgehammers to clear barricades from a major road in the city’s business district.
“The silent majority are the people who are obeying the law and doing everything to build Hong Kong into what it is,” Susanna Lee, who runs her own real estate company, said by phone.
“Protesters reinforced illegal road blocks with cement, wood boards and bamboo poles,” Hong Kong Police Senior Superintendent Tsui Wai-Hung said minutes before the operation.
“The Hong Kong government has no intention to reopen dialogue with students,” said Alex Chow, the secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the protest groups.
After yesterday’s skirmishes in the central business district, protesters spent the night reinforcing barricades around the main protest site in Admiralty.
