Eddie Luk and Kenneth LauMonday, October 13, 2014Occupy Central has "spun out of control," Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying warned yesterday, but clearing the protest sites would only be "a last resort" and done with minimal force.
As the chief executive, Leung should take responsibility for what happened and resign, they said.
Police fired tear gas and used pepper spray during a series of protests on September 28.
Asked what was the purpose of using tear gas, Leung responded: "We have relied on the police's professional judgment and training."
On Occupy Central, Leung said it was a "mass movement" that has spun out of control.
