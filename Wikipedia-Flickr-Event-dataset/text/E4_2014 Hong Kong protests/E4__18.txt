A boss at HSBC bank has caused fury among Hong Kong democracy protesters after she claimed they should wait to get the right to vote, just like U.S. slaves did.

The chairwoman of the Financial Services Development Council, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, made her incendiary comments, denounced by thousands, at an event in Paris, reports the Hong Kong Standard newspaper.

She said: "American slaves were liberated in 1861 but did not get voting rights until 107 years later. So why can't Hong Kong wait for a while?"

She added that democracy takes time and Hong Kong needed the confidence of investors.

However, her remarks have not gone down well.

Thousands of people have signed an online petition demanding an apology.

"We, the Hong Kong public, will not stand for these remarks likening our rights to slavery, nor will we stand for the kind of voter disenfranchisement her and her associates attempt to perpetrate on the Hong Kong public," said the petition addressed to HSBC.

By Friday night, more than 6,000 people had signed the petition.

Cha's comments came after more than a month of protests in the former British colony, now ruled by China, calling for people to be allowed to elect their own candidates to government, rather than ones chosen by Beijing.

At its peak, more than 100,000 people have joined the ongoing protests.
