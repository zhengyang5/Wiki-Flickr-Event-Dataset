More than 50,000 people have filled the streets of Hong Kong in the past few days, and at times the number has climbed higher.
Something of that same spirit seems to be operating in Hong Kong.
There is an additional, self-regarding twist: Russian commentators say Hong Kong protests are American revenge for Chinaâ€™s strong support for Russia in its struggle against Ukraine.
If the Hong Kong protests are an American plot, then mainland Chinese can safely ignore it.
We believe that the people of Hong Kong can and should organize their own institutions, separate from those of the state.
