The deputy chairman of the Hong Kong Legislative Council’s security panel has reportedly said that the government is working with criminal gangs to break-up student democracy protests.
Some female students reported being sexually assaulted and the police have been accused of not doing enough to protect students.
Many bystanders and activists said that members of triad gangs were involved in the attacks and police confirmed that eight of the 19 people arrested in Mong Kok Friday night were suspected of having backgrounds in organized crime.
“The order of Hong Kong has been disrupted, traffic paralyzed, stores forced to close, people cannot commute to work and students cannot attend classes,” one of the conveners of the blue-ribbon movement, Leticia Lee, told the Hong Kong Standard.
“Occupy participants do not represent the viewpoints of all Hong Kong people.”Many blue-ribbon supporters appear to have strong ties to the uniformed services.
