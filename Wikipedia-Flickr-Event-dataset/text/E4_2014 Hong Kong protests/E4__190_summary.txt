I am reminded of this observation by Beijing's incessant complaints about foreign interference in Hong Kong.
It's not Western agents Beijing needs to worry about, but Western ideas, ideals and narratives.
But as a matter of foreign policy for Western countries, it's safe to conclude such influences are vastly exaggerated.
Most pan-democrats and their allies don't need to be run by foreign agents when they have long ago adopted the Western narratives on the city's democratic development and the country's one-party state.
When it comes to such Western values and narratives, they are true believers compared to many Western policymakers and pundits who are far more realistic about Hong Kong vis-Ã -vis China.
