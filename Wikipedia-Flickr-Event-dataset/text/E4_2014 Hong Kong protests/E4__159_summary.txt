Up to 200 gangsters from two major triads across the city were mobilised to infiltrate the camps of supporters and detractors of the Occupy protests during chaos in Mong Kok more than a week ago, police said.
Since October 5, the force had assigned about 300 plain-clothes officers from the Criminal Investigation Department to Mong Kok to prevent triads from creating more trouble, Ng said.
The protest in Mong Kok began on September 28, hours after Occupy Central organisers launched their democracy sit-in.
Multiple sources blamed various factions of the Wo Shing Wo triad for the Mong Kok disorder.
Wo Shing Wo also sent its "operation squad", comprising 20 South Asians, to Mong Kok on those two days, according to an anti-triad officer.
