A Chinese state-run newspaper has blamed the United States for being behind the pro-democracy protests that have rattled Hong Kong – a claim strongly rejected by the State Department.
Students and activists leading the protests remain locked in a stalemate with the government, which has called off scheduled negotiations and instead urged protesters to retreat from the streets.
Protest leaders have vowed to keep up the demonstrations until the government responds to demands for voters to have a greater say in choosing Hong Kong’s leader.
Citing unidentified media reports, the commentary claimed that Louisa Greve, a director at NED, met Hong Kong protest leaders months ago to discuss the movement.
When asked about the State Department’s role in the Hong Kong protests, department spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Friday that US officials “categorically reject accusations that we are manipulating the activities of any person, group or political party in Hong Kong”.
