Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive Leung Chun-ying on Sunday blamed “external forces” for the unprecedented pro-democracy protests which continue to paralyse large swathes of the city in their 22nd consecutive day.
“There is obviously participation by people, organisations from outside of Hong Kong, in politics in Hong Kong, over a long time,” he said.
On Sunday, hundreds of people milled around a protest site in the gentrifying, densely-populated district Mong Kok, manning aid stations and sitting in small circles on the pavement.
“Activists from radical organisations as well as trouble-makers are mingling with other protesters” in Mong Kok, he said.
Leaders of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the protest’s organisers, have accepted the overture.
