Joshua Wong is too young to drive or buy a drink in a bar – let alone vote – yet has become the face of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and an inspiration to citizens three times his age.
The arrests galvanised those previously indifferent to last week’s student protests and sparked the wider civil disobedience movement that has paralysed a large part of downtown Hong Kong.

“It’s their Hong Kong – it’s their future.”Wong has said that matters are already out of his hands, and those of other activists.
“The hero of the movement is every single Hong Kong citizen.”
