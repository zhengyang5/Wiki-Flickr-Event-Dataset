Hong Kong students are currently protesting for more political freedom and have been using umbrellas to protect themselves from police pepper spray.
The movement was initiated by a group called Occupy Central With Love & Peace, led by Hong Kong University law professor Benny Tai.
Protesters want the right to nominate and directly elect the head of the Hong Kong government, known as the chief executive.
China, which resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong after it stopped being a British colony in 1997, wants to screen who can stand for office.
They feel little in common with mainland Chinese and want Hong Kong to become politically autonomous â€” almost independent.
