Occupy Central marshals yesterday made citizen's arrests on three men who pelted Next Media owner Jimmy Lai Chee-ying with bags containing rotten animal intestines at Admiralty.

The three men were handed over to the police but they are likely to be released after Lai said he would not press charges.

Lai, 66, was standing under a marquee yesterday when the three men arrived carrying a suitcase from which they pulled out plastic bags filled with "putrid brown" animal organs and pelted him as one shouted "go die."

They were quickly subdued by Occupy supporters who wrestled and pinned them to the ground. One of the offenders had his shirt ripped.

Scuffles began as the three men struggled with protesters and attempted to get away.

Police eventually arrived on the scene and led the men away.

Alex Kwok, one of the volunteer marshals who "guards" protesters at the Admiralty site, said Lai was the prime target.

"It was evident Lai was the target of the three men ... [the bags] hit his head and his body," he said.

"We marshals immediately tried to stop them. Afterwards, some citizens came to help and the three started beating the marshals including myself," added Kwok, who sported a light bruise under his left eye.

Lai escaped unhurt but his clothes and face were stained. The media tycoon appeared shaken after the incident, but said he "would be back tomorrow."

He decided not to press charges.

"They threw pig intestines at him. I think it was three guys," his spokesman Mark Simon said. "He will definitely go back [to the site] ... these guys were hired."

Simon did not want to speculate on who was behind the attacks. STAFF REPORTER
