Joshua Wong/Wikimedia Commons Joshua Wong, 17, a student protester and the leader of the "Scholarism" movement in Hong Kong, has reportedly been arrested by police during a student protest.
More than 5,000 high school and university students in Hong Kong have been protesting illegally outside of Hong Kong government headquarters in Tamar Park for the last five days.
When Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it was agreed that the former colony would coexist with China under the principle of "one country, two systems," meaning that Hong Kong would have a high degree of autonomy and eventually achieve genuine democracy.
In response, Wong started the student protest movement Scholarism.
