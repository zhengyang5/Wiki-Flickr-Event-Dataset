Umbrella Movement: Who are the winners and losers?
Following the police clearing operations in the remaining protest sites in Admiralty and Causeway Bay, mainland media have started calling Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement a “dismal failure”.
After the 70-odd days of protests, various camps and factions are now assessing the gains and losses of the Umbrella Movement amid the shifting political landscape in the post-Occupy era.
The movement has turned out to be a mixed blessing to those in the pan-democratic camp.
Major pro-Beijing groups like the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (民建聯), especially its youth outreach programs like Young DAB, will be given more resources.
