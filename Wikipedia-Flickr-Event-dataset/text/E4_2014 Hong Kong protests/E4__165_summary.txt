TVB supports its news chief's "professionalism and judgment" in handling a report on a group of policemen allegedly beating an Occupy protester on Wednesday, the broadcaster's boss says.
The report includes graphic footage taken by a TVB film crew during an overnight police operation to clear a road near government headquarters in Admiralty.
In a separate, open letter on Wednesday, 27 journalists from TVB's news department said they disagreed with station management's judgment on the report.
Lee wrote, in reply to Mo and Fan, that "extra care is needed when reporting an incident that could involve criminal liability".
Lee also rounded on TVB staff for secretly recording an internal meeting between Yuen and the news department on Thursday.
