Amnesty: Hong Kong Protest Supporters Tortured in ChinaVoA - News | Friday 13th February, 2015 |The London-based rights group said in a statement Thursday at least 27 supporters of the so-called Umbrella Movement remain behind bars in China.
Li Yufeng, a women's rights activist from Hunan Province, was also arrested in September and accused of "creating a disturbance" for her statements in support of the Hong Kong protests.
She has been on sporadic hunger strikes and has been force-fed liquid food at least twice," said the Amnesty statement.
The so-called Occupy Central protest movement shut down key streets in Hong Kong for two-and-a-half months beginning in late September.
The protesters want Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to resign and Beijing to reverse its decision to screen candidates for the territory's 2017 election.
