“It is important that democracy involves real choices,” Cameron said, stressing the importance Britain attached to the agreement.
“These are important freedoms, jointly guaranteed through that joint declaration and it’s that which, most of all, we should stand up for.”Cameron was speaking after pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong clashed overnight with police.
