A two-hour dialogue between protest leaders and five Hong Kong government officials in October yielded no common ground. The session was the first of what was expected to be several rounds of talks aimed at resolving the political crisis, but a second round was never forthcoming. Protesters have sought to pressure the government to revisit the NPC standing committee decision and allow for an open nominations system.
