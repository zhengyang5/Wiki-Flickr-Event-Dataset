Hong Kong Chief executive CY Leung - who is in Beijing - received the full support of President Xi Jinping in his dealings with the protesters.
Mr Xi said that he firmly supported Hong Kong in "driving forward the development of democracy according to the law, and in safeguarding the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong".
Protesters say that attempts to negotiate with the Hong Kong government have failed and now appear to be directing their grievances towards China's national leaders, our correspondent says.
China now has ultimate sovereignty over Hong Kong following the handover from Britain in 1997, although the territory still enjoys a large degree of autonomy.
