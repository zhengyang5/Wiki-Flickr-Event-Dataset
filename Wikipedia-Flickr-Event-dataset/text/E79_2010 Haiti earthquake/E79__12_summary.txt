US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has become the first senior Western official to arrive in Haiti after the earthquake that flattened the capital.
Mrs Clinton told the Haitian people that the US would be "here today, tomorrow and for the time ahead".
The UN has meanwhile confirmed the head of its mission in Haiti has been found dead in the rubble of its headquarters.
You have been severely tested, but I believe that Haiti can come back even better and stronger in the future."
President Bush urged Americans to send "cash", and President Clinton said Haitians "can escape their history and built a better future if we do our part".
