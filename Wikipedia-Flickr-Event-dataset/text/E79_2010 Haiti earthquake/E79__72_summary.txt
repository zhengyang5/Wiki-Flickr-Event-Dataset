US Red Cross is out of medical supplies in Haiti American Red Cross says it has run out of medical supplies in Haiti WASHINGTON - [+] Enlarge.
The 7.0-magnitude earthquake that hit Haiti on Tuesday flattened the president's palace, the cathedral, hospitals, schools, the main prison and whole neighborhoods.
Red Cross spokesman Eric Porterfield said Wednesday that the small amount of medical equipment and medical supplies that were available in Haiti has been distributed.
The Red Cross is sending more medical supplies to Haiti, but Porterfield says he does not know when they will arrive.
Porterfield says he doesn't know if the depletion of medical supplies is preventing victims in critical condition from being treated.
