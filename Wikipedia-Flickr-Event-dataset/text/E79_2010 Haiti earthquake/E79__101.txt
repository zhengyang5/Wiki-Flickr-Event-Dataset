WASHINGTON – The main elements of the U.S. relief effort began to arrive in Haiti, with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson taking up position off Haiti’s coast and beginning to fly in water and other badly-needed supplies.

The Vinson, a nuclear-powered ship with a crew of more than 3,000, is the largest American vessel to reach Haiti since a powerful earthquake Tuesday killed thousands of people and destroyed large swaths of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince.

The ship joins the rapidly expanding contingent of U.S. troops deployed to Haiti.

More than 3,000 soldiers from the Army’s 82nd Infantry Division will be on the ground in Haiti this weekend, and the USS Bataan, an amphibious ship carrying 2,200 Marines, is slated to arrive off the coast of Haiti next week alongside the USNS Comfort, the military’s largest medical ship.

Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that up to 10,000 American troops will be operating in or near Haiti by Monday. Adm. Mullen, the nation’s top military officer, said the size of the U.S. military commitment could grow even larger in coming days.
