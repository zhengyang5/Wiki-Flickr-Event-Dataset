Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Search-and-rescue efforts at a supermarket in Haiti's capital have ended after teams determined no one else was alive beneath the rubble, an official told CNN Wednesday.
A French excavation team was working at the Caribbean Supermarket on Tuesday.
The French team called in U.S. and Mexican teams to help with the rescue.
But at 11 p.m. Tuesday, the teams determined there was no one else alive under the rubble, and they called off the rescue mission, Renou told CNN Wednesday.
Caribbean Supermarket was the scene of a number of rescues after the earthquake, including the rescue of five people in one weekend.
