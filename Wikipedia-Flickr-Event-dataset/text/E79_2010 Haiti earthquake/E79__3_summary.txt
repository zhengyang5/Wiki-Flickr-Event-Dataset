Tectonic SummaryThe January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake occurred in the boundary region separating the Caribbean plate and the North America plate.
At the longitude of the January 12 earthquake, motion between the Caribbean and North American plates is partitioned between two major east-west trending, strike-slip fault systems -- the Septentrional fault system in northern Haiti and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system in southern Haiti.
This fault system accommodates about 7 mm/y, nearly half the overall motion between the Caribbean plate and North America plate.
The Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system has not produced a major earthquake in recent decades.
