SportsHaitian Football Federation says 30 dead...Burrell's fact-finding mission reveals 20 others entombed in rubbleAt least 30 members of Haiti's football family have been confirmed dead in the wake of last Tuesday's catastrophic earthquake.
President of the Haitian Football Federation (HFF), Dr Jean Bart, confirmed this to Caribbean Football Union (CFU) senior vice-president, Jamaican Captain Horace Burrell, who visited the ravaged Caribbean island on Sunday on a fact-finding mission at the request of FIFA vice-president, Austin 'Jack' Warner.
Several senior committee members, including administrators, referees, coaches, players, medical personnel and office staff are counted among the dead, or otherwise missing throughout the capital of the French-speaking Caribbean island.
Dr Bart is believed to have been the only survivor of that meeting.
FIFA itself has committed US$250,000, while FIFA vice-president Korean Chung Moon-Jung of Hyundai motor fame has pledged US$500,000 of his own funds.
