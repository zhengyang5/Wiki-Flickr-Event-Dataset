Port-au-Prince (Agenzia Fides) – "The humanitarian situation is still in an emergency phase.
Over 1 million refugees are living in tents and, instead of diminishing, the number is on the rise.
“Many new makeshift camps are appearing on the hills of northern Port-au-Prince,” says the Nuncio.
The first camp set up by the transitional government and the international community in the area of Corail, north/northeast of the capital, seems to have failed due to lack of services and other things.
We hope that within three years we will be able to inaugurate a new Major Seminary.” (CE) (Agenzia Fides 21/09/2010)
