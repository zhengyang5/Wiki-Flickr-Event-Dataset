Damaged buildings are being demolished in Port-au-PrinceHaiti's government says about 230,000 people died in last month's earthquake, 18,000 more than its previous estimate.
The toll from the 12 January quake is approaching that of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which killed 250,000 people.
Communications Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said the toll was not definitive.
But later, Interior Minister Paul Bien-Aime issued a slightly different total, saying the "verified" death toll was "more than 217,000".
He said: "There are people who put forth the figure of 230,000, but we have counted a bit more than 217,000.
