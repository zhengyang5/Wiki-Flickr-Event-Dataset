Tens of thousands isolated at quake epicentreUpdatedThe immense scale of the earthquake devastation outside Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, is becoming clearer.
People in Leogane, at the quake's epicentre, have so far been left to fend for themselves in ad hoc squatter camps.
"It's the very epicentre of the earthquake, and many, many thousands are dead," said World Food Program (WFP) spokesman David Orr.
Tens of thousands are living in the open in church compounds, school playgrounds and market places.
US coastguard officers working on rescue efforts in Haiti have delivered a baby boy, as his mother and five other earthquake survivors were medevacked.
