Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- After more than a month in a Haitian jail, an American missionary was free Monday night, looking forward to a hot shower and a long night in bed on home soil.
But Charisa Coulter's heart remains in Haiti, her father said, because her best friend, Laura Silsby is now alone behind bars.
"She came back with mixed emotions," Mel Coulter told CNN affiliate WSVN in Miami, Florida.
Haitian Judge Bernard Saint-Vil released Coulter on Friday.
Coulter, Silsby and eight other Americans had been detained in Haiti on suspicion of kidnapping 33 children after the killer earthquake January 12.
