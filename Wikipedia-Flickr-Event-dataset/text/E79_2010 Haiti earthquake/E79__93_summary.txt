Today, there are 12 people who need lifesaving amputations at Choscal Hospital.
“It is like working in a war situation,” said Rosa Crestani, MSF medical coordinator for Choscal Hospital.
We cannot accept that planes carrying lifesaving medical supplies and equipment continue to be turned away while our patients die.
Another two planes carrying a total of 26 MSF aid workers were diverted to Dominican Republic.
MSF teams are currently working in Choscal Hospital, Martissant Health Center, Trinite Hospital, Carrefour hospital, Jacmel Hospital, and are establishing a 100-bed inflatable hospital in the Delmas area.
