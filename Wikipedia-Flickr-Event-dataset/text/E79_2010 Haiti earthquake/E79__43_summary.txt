Much of the poor-quality work can be traced to the grinding poverty pervasive in Haiti, he said.
"As we know, the poverty in Haiti lends itself to people building where they want, how they can," he said.
"So now we need to work with the Haitian authorities to develop a building code that is suited to Haiti and its peculiar conditions."
Springer said the country must work with the private sector and the banking sector to devise a low-income building ethic for Haiti.
"Because of the poverty levels, not everybody's going to be able to build to the exacting standards that a building code would require," Springer said.
