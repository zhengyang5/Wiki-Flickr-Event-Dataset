Agence France-Presse, quoting local media, said two Dominicans were seriously wounded after being shot Saturday as they handed out aid.
“It takes time for all this aid to be distributed,” said Ronald Ackermans, a Belgian veteran of search-and-rescue operations in past disasters.
At the field hospital by the Laboratoire National de Sante Public in Port-au-Prince, Canadian military personnel were reusing latex gloves and resorting to cardboard ripped from supply boxes for splints Saturday.
Elsewhere, scores of desperate quake survivors struggled Saturday to get their hands on bottled water being distributed by one aid group.
