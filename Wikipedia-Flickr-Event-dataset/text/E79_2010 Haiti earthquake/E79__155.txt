About this paper Country: Haiti Haiti

In years of responding to disasters, the destruction and logistical challenges caused by Haiti’s earthquake which struck on 12 January 2010, were among the worst Oxfam has ever encountered. Our Haiti response (coordinated from a makeshift office in a battered hut after our Port-au-Prince office had been destroyed) has been a story of obstacles overcome.

As with the Asian Tsunami emergency almost five years earlier, public support for the Haiti disaster was overwhelmingly generous, with over $US 98 million raised to fund Oxfam’s humanitarian response. This report shows how Oxfam has utilized this earthquake response fund to help hundreds of thousands of people cope in the days, weeks and months following the disaster.

One year later, Oxfam has achieved considerable success in a context of overwhelming ongoing human need. At the time of writing, we have reached over 500,000 people with our earthquake response program, and a further 700,000 people with activities to prevent the spread of cholera.
