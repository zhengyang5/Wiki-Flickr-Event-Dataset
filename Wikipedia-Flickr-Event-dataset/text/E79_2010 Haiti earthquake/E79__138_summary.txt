Stelmach announced the donation to the Red Cross following a swearing-in ceremony for his new cabinet in Edmonton on Friday morning.
"We will work with the Red Cross â€¦ so that we get the best effort in place to ensure that we're looking after as many people as we can."
On Thursday, when asked how Alberta planned to help in Haiti, Stelmach told reporters that Alberta contributes to humanitarian aid in other ways, through grants and charitable tax deductions.
The Red Cross estimates that between 45,000 and 50,000 people might have died in the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that devastated the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince.
