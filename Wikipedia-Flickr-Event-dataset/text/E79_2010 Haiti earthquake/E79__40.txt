WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The World Bank said on Tuesday it was ready to send a team to Haiti to assess the extent of damage caused by the earthquake and begin working on plans for rebuilding the country.

The bank said it was also ready to mobilize aid to Haiti but did not elaborate on how much it could make available. It said its offices in a suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince were destroyed by the quake and most bank employees were accounted for.
