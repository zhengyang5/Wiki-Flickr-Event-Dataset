Corrections, Public Safety and Policing Minister D.F. (Yogi) Huyghebaert today announced the province of Saskatchewan is donating $250,000 to assist the people of Haiti. The funds will be provided to the Red Cross.

Saskatchewan has already offered to provide any personnel and equipment needed for the country's role in the Haiti effort, including expertise in health care and search and rescue teams.

The minister also extended thanks to the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan for donating $500,000 to Haiti relief funds and matching donations made by their 5,000 employees. The Canadian Red Cross and Care Canada each received $250,000 from the company. This announcement on Thursday marked the single, largest donation by a Canadian company.

"Saskatchewan people and their generous spirit have always stepped up to the plate to help those in need," Huyghebaert said. "I urge all people in our province to continue to do what comes naturally to people here - give to those needing assistance."



Other Saskatchewan efforts include the Saskatchewan Day of Caring for Haiti, a radio-thon by News Talk Radio for the Red Cross on January 20. The event will begin at 6 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. The radio station is looking for volunteers to help answer calls.
