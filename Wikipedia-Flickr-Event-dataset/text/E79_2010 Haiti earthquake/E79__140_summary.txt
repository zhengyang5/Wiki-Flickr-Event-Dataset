QUEBEC PLEDGES $3M IN EMERGENCY AID TO HAITIQUEBEC – The Quebec government is providing $3 million in immediate emergency aid to help the people of Haiti.
Premier Jean Charest said Monday the money will be given out to non-governmental agencies that are already working in Haiti.
“They will be able to use this to help people in emergency situations,” Charest told reporters in Quebec City.
Quebec has already offered to provide any personnel to assist in Canada's relief effort in Haiti, including police officers and health professionals.
Among the officers of Haitian origin at the church yesterday was Constable André Belotte, a patrol officer in Côte St. Luc.
