About 44 of the orphans' adoptions had yet to be approved by a Haitian judge, even though they were matched to Dutch parents, Mikkelsen said.
Dutch officials may seek the remaining approvals from Haiti once the children have already settled in the Netherlands, he added.
Haiti is home to about 380,000 orphans, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, and that number is expected to grow in the wake of Tuesday's earthquake.
The efforts, coordinated with the governments of both countries, will eventually take the children back to Haiti.
Some will be reunited with parents who lost communication with their children in the quake's aftermath, the group said.
