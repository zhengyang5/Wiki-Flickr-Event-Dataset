The commander of the first American ship to reach earthquake-stricken Port-au-Prince, Haiti, described a scene of extraordinary devastation, with collapsed buildings reaching from the port into the hills above.
The Coast Guard cutter Forward, dispatched from the American naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, arrived early Wednesday, the only large vessel in the harbor.
Diane W. Durham, commander of the vessel, said Haitian officials told her that half of the 80 members of the Haitian coast guard stationed at the port had been killed in the earthquake.
An American Coast Guard helicopter evacuated four injured staff members from the American embassy in Port-au-Prince to Guantánamo Bay, where the United States has medical facilities.
Two C-130 transport planes flew overhead, providing assessments of the damage to American officials who are planning a large deployment to Haiti to assist with rescue and recovery efforts.
