Rescue workers have saved more than 70 people from the rubble of Haiti's earthquake, an unusually high success rate in an otherwise extremely challenging relief operation, a U.N. spokeswoman said Sunday.
People might live for six days in the rubble, and morale is good among the 1,739 rescue workers, she said.
She said aid was coming through the Port-au-Prince airport, the seaport at Gonaives, Santo Domingo's airport and seaport in the Dominican Republic, as well as two small private airports in the neighboring country.
Experts are moving to clear damage from Port-au-Prince's seaport so that it can be used as well, Byrs said.
Telephone systems remain damaged and limited, and telecommunications continue very difficult for Haitians and relief workers, she said.
