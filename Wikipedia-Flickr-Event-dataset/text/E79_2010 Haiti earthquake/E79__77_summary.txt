(CNN) -- A 48-hour-old fundraising campaign to help Haiti earthquake victims, done solely through text messages, was already stunning Red Cross officials on Thursday when it hit $3 million.
"It's shattered any record that we've seen with mobile giving before," Wendy Harman, social media manager for the Red Cross, said Thursday.
"Yele haiti now for the disaster," Lohan tweeted Wednesday, referring to musician Wyclef Jean's online earthquake relief fund.
Many Facebook users also were changing their status updates to reflect when they'd donated to the Red Cross campaign, thus encouraging their friends to do likewise.
She said the Red Cross has "a pretty robust social media strategy" but that the Haiti response is unprecedented.
