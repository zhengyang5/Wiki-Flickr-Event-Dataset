((Jorge Saenz/Associated Press)) Canada is pledging an additional $400 million in aid and debt relief for Haiti over the next two years, International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda said Wednesday.
This includes pledges of $5.3 billion from governments and international partners within the first 24 months.
Canada's commitment also includes $8 million in debt relief to Haiti, part of a broader cancellation of the impoverished country's overall $40 million World Bank debt.
Canada had previously pledged $85 million in Haitian relief aid.
"Canada is prepared to accompany Haiti for as long as it needs us," he said.
