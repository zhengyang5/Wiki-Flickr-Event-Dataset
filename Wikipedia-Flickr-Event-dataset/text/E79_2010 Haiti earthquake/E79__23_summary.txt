Petit Paradis, Haiti (CNN) -- Sitting in the shade away from the heat, Jean Frank is making a fishing net that he hopes will help him return to his life as a fisherman.
The tsunami apparently took the lives of at least seven villagers in the town of Petit Paradis, on Haiti's western coast.
Residents say it used to be part of the beach, but now it's about 30 yards out in the blue ocean.
Villagers here at Petit Paradis, or Little Paradise, say they are still numb.
Edme says that villages and towns such as Petit Paradis were forgotten as rescue efforts and food distributions began in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince.
