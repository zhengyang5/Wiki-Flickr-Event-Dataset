Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The U.S. price tag for relief in Haiti has hit $170 million, the federal government announced Thursday as ton after ton of relief supplies headed into the island nation through a crucial reopened pier.
After days of being closed to much needed food and supplies, the south pier at Port-au-Prince was channeling aid into the leveled capital city.
The supplies were brought into Port-au-Prince on trucks traveling on a repaired gravel road leading from the port.
The reopened pier is older and smaller than the north pier, which was rendered unusable by the January 12 earthquake.
The south pier was damaged, but Haiti port authorities and the U.S. military were able to put it back in adequate shape.
