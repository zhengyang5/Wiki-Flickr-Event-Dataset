Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Rescuers were still finding survivors trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings in earthquake-ravaged Haiti on Wednesday, and relief officials said efforts to get aid into the hands of survivors were improving.
A magnitude 5.9 aftershock rattled Port-au-Prince early Wednesday, the strongest since the original 7.0-magnitude quake struck January 12, the United States Geological Survey reported.
Wednesday's aftershock was centered about 35 miles (60 kilometers) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, and about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) deep, according to the USGS.
The confirmed toll already puts Haiti's quake among the 10 deadliest of the last century, according to USGS figures.
The ship carries 40 doctors, including 13 surgeons, and enough medical supplies to operate for 60 days.
