Aid agencies have called for an urgent airdrop of 200,000 tents to Haiti The acting head of the UN mission in Haiti has said reconstruction will take several decades, following the devastating earthquake two weeks ago.
Mr Mulet said reconstruction was not starting at zero, but "below zero".
As many as 200,000 people died in the earthquake on 12 January, while an estimated 1.5 million are now homeless.
Later, Mr Mulet told the BBC that all of Haiti's recent development had been undone.
"I think this is going to take many more decades than only 10 years and this is an enormous backwards step in Haiti's development.
