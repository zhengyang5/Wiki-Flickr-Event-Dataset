AN Argentine-staffed hospital is the only one operating in Haiti's earthquake devastated capital, and is struggling to cope with huge numbers of injured, its director told Argentine television.
"The Argentine hospital is the only one open'' in the capital of more then two million, director Daniel Desimone told Todo Noticias.
"We are having to make do with just the (Argentine) hospital to meet the needs of the (peacekeeping) mission and the entire population of Haiti,'' which tops nine million people.
"The situation is really critical because we cannot cope with this many dead and injured,'' Mr Desimone said.
A lot of children were left by their parents at the hospital, when the parents were going back out to search for family members,'' Mr Desimone said.
