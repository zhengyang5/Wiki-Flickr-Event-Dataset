The Obama administration extended a special immigration status on Friday to Haitians living illegally in the United States that protects them from deportation for 18 months and allows them to work here.
Administration officials said the special status would cover at least 100,000 Haitians believed to be living in the United States illegally, as well as about 30,000 Haitians who had been ordered deported.
Haitians who receive the temporary status will be able to obtain documents allowing them to live here and work legally.
The administrationâ€™s decision followed a rising chorus of calls for the temporary status after the earthquake on Tuesday.
Until now, officials had hesitated to grant the temporary status for fear it would encourage a new exodus of desperate Haitians by boat toward South Florida.
