Haiti had no state-supported healthcare: no food security other than that provided by international aid agencies.
Not all of Haiti was affected by the earthquake, large areas were left untouched.
Even before the earthquake Port-au-Prince only had infrastructure to support 400,000.
In the immediate aftermath of Haiti's earthquake, his response – painted on walls across the capital – became the emblem for the nation.
A desperate place before the earthquake struck, despite the brief moment of international attention it has become more desperate still.
