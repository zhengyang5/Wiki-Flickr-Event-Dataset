PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti’s voodoo priests are objecting to anonymous mass burials as an improper way to handle the tens of thousands of dead from the earthquake — and have taken their complaint to President Rene Preval.
The body of a child lies amongst the rubble of a collapsed house in Port-au-Prince January 16, 2010.
“It is not in our culture to bury people in such a fashion,” Haiti’s main voodoo leader, Max Beauvoir, said in a meeting with Preval.
More than half of Haiti’s 9 million people are believed to practice voodoo, a religion with roots in Africa.
Red Cross officials have repeatedly said no one should fear disease from dead bodies after the earthquake that is believed to have killed up to 200,000 people.
