Citigroup Inc said on Sunday it had resumed operations in Haiti, but has relocated operations after a massive earthquake on January 12 damaged its main building and killed five employees.
Citi, which has been in Haiti since 1971, said it will serve corporate customers out of the ScotiaBank Building in Petion-Ville.
The company said on Jan 13 that its three-story main building in Port-au-Prince had suffered extensive damage.
It was the most powerful earthquake to affect Haiti in more than a century.
