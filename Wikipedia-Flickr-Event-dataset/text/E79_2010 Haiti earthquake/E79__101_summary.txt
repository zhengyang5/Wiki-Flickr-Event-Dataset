WASHINGTON – The main elements of the U.S. relief effort began to arrive in Haiti, with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson taking up position off Haiti’s coast and beginning to fly in water and other badly-needed supplies.
The Vinson, a nuclear-powered ship with a crew of more than 3,000, is the largest American vessel to reach Haiti since a powerful earthquake Tuesday killed thousands of people and destroyed large swaths of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince.
