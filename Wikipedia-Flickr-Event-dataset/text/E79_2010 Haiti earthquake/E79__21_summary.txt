But the authorities said the biggest dangers now facing survivors of last week’s major earthquake were untreated wounds and rising disease, not falling debris.
“There are people, many people, who are going to die unless they’re treated.”For the seriously ill, the chances of surviving may depend on leaving Haiti entirely.

“Nobody knows how many doctors, how many nurses have come to Haiti,” said Dr. Henriette Chamouillet, head of the World Health Organization in Haiti.
