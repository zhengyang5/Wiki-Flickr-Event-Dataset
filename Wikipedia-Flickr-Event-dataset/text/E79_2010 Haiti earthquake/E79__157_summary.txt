Thursday marks the second anniversary of the Haiti earthquake that killed 316,000 people, but experts say it could be at least another 10 years before the country sees any noticeable recovery.
"A lot of good work was done; the money clearly didn't all get squandered," Jake Johnston, a researcher at The Center for Economic Policy Research, told the Miami Herald.
"Although progress is not as fast as we would like, recovery is well underway," Gail McGovern, president and CEO of the American Red Cross, said in a statement.
"The pace of home construction has increased rapidly, with the American Red Cross and the rest of the global Red Cross network providing housing to more than 100,000 people at the two-year mark."
"Quite honestly, donor funding is never going to be enough," Tom Adams, the U.S. State Department's Haiti special coordinator, told the Miami Herald.
