As Haiti mourns, quake survivor found in rubble 1/24/2010 05:51:00 AM PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti – A man buried for 11 days in the wreckage of Haiti's devastating earthquake was pulled from the rubble, as officials said they were shifting their focus from rescue to caring for the thousands of survivors living in squalid, makeshift camps.
Also on Saturday, organizers for the all-star "Hope for Haiti Now" telethon in the U.S. said the event raised $57 million — and counting.
Such stars as Brad Pitt, Beyonce, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and more used their presence to encourage donations for Haiti.
The quake destroyed key government buildings including the National Palace, hampering the work of what was already a weak and inefficient state.
The U.S. Geological Survery said Sunday it has recorded 52 aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 or greater since the Jan. 12 quake.
