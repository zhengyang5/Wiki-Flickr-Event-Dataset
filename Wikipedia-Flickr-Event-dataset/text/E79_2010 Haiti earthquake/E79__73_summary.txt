Volunteers in Buena Park sorted through supplies at the non-profit, Giving Children Hope.
The supplies will make their way to help the victims of Haiti's earthquake.
"The situation is absolutely crucial that we get some emergency supplies including pharmaceuticals, water purification tablets on the ground as quickly as possible," said Denise Steverding of Giving Children Hope.
These are some water purification tablets.
The volunteers hope to have all of the relief supplies packed up and on a ship to Haiti on Friday.
