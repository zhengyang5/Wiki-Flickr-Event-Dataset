Quettely Chevalier, a teacher at Haiti's only midwifery school, was giving a lecture on obstetric care at the nearby Lumiere University when the earthquake hit.
The midwifery school was left standing, but may have structural damage too serious for future use.
Whereabouts of teachers and students unknownThe midwifery school had 78 students and turned out about 35 midwives each year-an important and much-needed contribution towards reducing the country's maternal mortality rate.
Classes at the midwifery school ended at four o'clock on the day of the earthquake, less than an hour before the disaster struck.
