PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haitiâ€”When Haitians realized their National Palace was destroyed, many feared President Rene Preval was dead.
"We froze, then took three or four steps back, and the residence just fell before us," Debrosse Preval said.
Stunned, the first couple sat in their yard as government, police and church officials brought news of tragedy from across the capital.
The president has yet to address the nation or publicly tour disaster areas, angering many Haitians.
Speaking at the airport police station that is the government's temporary headquarters, the first lady showed reporters the blurry iPhone pictures she took of her husband the night of the quake.
