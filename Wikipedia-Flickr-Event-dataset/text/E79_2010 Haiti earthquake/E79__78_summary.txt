There has recently been a flurry of activity in the Open Street Map community to improve maps of Haiti to assist humanitarian aid organisations responding to the recent earthquake.
The OpenStreetMap community can help the response by tracing Yahoo imagery and other data sources, and collecting existing data sets below.
Yesterday several companies authorised the OSM community to use their images.
There have been specific requests for up to date mapping information from humanitarian organisations on the ground.
The following two images – before and after the earthquake – give you an impression of how much the OSM community have been doing!
