Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Scores of bodies were found in a mass grave outside the capital city of Port-au-Prince on Friday, a sign of Haitians' desperation three days after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated the impoverished nation.
At least 100 bodies were discovered by a CNN crew in one open pit outside Port-au-Prince, with several other pits half-filled or completely covered over with earth, presumably full.
An 11-year-old girl rescued Thursday -- an effort CNN captured on camera throughout the day -- died later that night from her injuries after a first-aid station said it couldn't treat her severe leg wound, her family said.
Many of the capital's 3 million people are without access to food, water, shelter and electricity, he said, and crews are working "to save as many lives as possible."
