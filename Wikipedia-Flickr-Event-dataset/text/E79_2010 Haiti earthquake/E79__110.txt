More than 100,000 people lived in Leogane before the earthquake A rescuer from Devon who has been helping earthquake survivors in a Haitian town says he has seen piles of corpses during their work there. Members of the rescue agency Rapid-UK arrived in Leogane, near the capital Port-au-Prince, over the weekend. Volunteer Anthony Thomas, 47, from Bovey Tracey, said his team rescued two women from some rubble before getting to the town. But he said they have not found any more survivors since. Mr Thomas said of rescuing the two women: "That is a good, good feeling when you manage to get someone out." As tragic as it is, you do get used to the death

Anthony Thomas The team found large areas of Leogane had been reduced to a landscape of rubble and twisted metal. Before the quake, more than 100,000 people lived there. "We were obviously the first team in there," Mr Thomas said. "Our job is to try and get people out from under the smashed buildings, but there was nobody to rescue. "There were dead bodies piled up by the roads. The people left are absolutely desperate for medical help." Mr Thomas is working in a team of nine attached to the UK Fire Service. He said: "This is my fifth mission to a disaster zone and, as tragic as it is, you do get used to the death." He said the chances of finding anyone else alive in the rubble were dwindling as time passed. The leading US general in Haiti Lt Gen Ken Keen has said it is a "reasonable assumption" that up to 200,000 people could have died in last week's earthquake. He said the disaster was of "epic proportions", but it was too early to know the full human cost.
