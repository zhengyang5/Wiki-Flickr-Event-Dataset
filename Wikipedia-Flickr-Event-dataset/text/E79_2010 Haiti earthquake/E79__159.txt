A Haitian delegation shared an innovative "bottom-up" approach to disaster reduction and management based on community integration and sustainable development with a cadre of top-level experts from approximately 38 nations, at the Consultative Group meeting of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). "The 2010 earthquake demonstrated that development will never be successful if we don't build risk reduction at our core. That is why the Martelly administration is committed to making disaster risk reduction and management, a critical priority across the government," said Thierry Mayard-Paul, Haiti's Chief of Staff and Minister of the Interior, Territorial Collectivities and National Defense, leading the delegation.

Through specific examples of how the government has integrated risk reduction as a centerpiece of its recovery efforts and of fruitful collaborative efforts between donors, NGOs, and federal and local governments, Mayard-Paul encouraged potential partners present at the meeting to help Haiti make a significant impact in disaster risk reduction and management, citing eight key areas of potential support, such as capacity building, infrastructure, knowledge and innovation, research, risk assessment, disaster risk reduction programming in priority cities, seismic and cyclonic risk reduction, communication and public awareness.
