Already one reconstruction official has been forced to step down for steering a public project to his company's private land at Corail-Cesselesse.
Wealthy landowners vow the "new Haiti" will become yet another vast slum unless the government rebuilds on their terms.
The 26-member international Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission, headed by Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, didn't convene until last month.
People who claim to be the landowners say it's worth $20,000 an acre.
The landowners say if they're not compensated, the "new Haiti" in Corail-Cesselesse will end up making the violent slums of pre-quake Port-au-Prince look tame.
