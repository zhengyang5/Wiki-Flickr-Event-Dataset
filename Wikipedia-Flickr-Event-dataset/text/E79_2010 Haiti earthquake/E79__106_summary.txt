JACMEL, Jan 20 (AFP) - With their cathedral clock frozen at 5:37, the shocked residents of this earthquake-stricken town in southern Haiti remain cut off from the world and have resorted to chartering boats to ferry out the injured.
"The clock kept on working during the first temblor at 4:40 pm, but it stopped when the second one struck," parish priest Rony Fabien said.
"Seventy percent of the homes were damaged by the quake" and an unknown number collapsed altogether, he added.
"I looked for a big tent, but couldn't find one, and there's no help from authorities," Van de Donk said.
The US Army has just announced it will set up camp in Jacmel, and things will soon improve in the city, he said.
