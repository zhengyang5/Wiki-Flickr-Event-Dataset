The best way for Canadians to help is to donate money - not clothing or food - to their preferred, experienced humanitarian organizations such as the Red Cross.

On January 14, 2010, the Government of Canada announced it would match the generosity of Canadians in response to the devastating earthquake in Haiti, up to a total of $50 million.

In order to avoid potential fraud, we urge you to check to see if your preferred charitable organization is registered before you give.

Decisions as to which organizations will receive funding will be based on the merit of their proposals to the relief fund and their ability to deliver aid quickly and effectively, and will require that the organizations have significant in-country capacity to deliver humanitarian, early recovery and reconstruction assistance in Haiti.
