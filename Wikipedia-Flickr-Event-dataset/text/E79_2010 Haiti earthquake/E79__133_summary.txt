The federal government has so far allocated $113 million to match individual donations made by Canadians to the Haiti relief effort, International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda said Monday.
The deadline for having personal donations matched by the federal government is Feb. 12.
"I encourage everyone to make that one final effort," Oda said during a briefing at Red Cross offices in Ottawa.
Oda said the matching funds will not come from other programs at the Canadian International Development Agency.
She said they are all maintained for CIDA by the Red Cross.
