The epicenter of the quake, which was initially reported a magnitude 7.0 off the coast, was located inland, six miles west of Carrefour, and just 10 miles from the capital Port-au-Prince.
A hospital collapsed near the epicentre, and cries of people within the structure were reported by witnesses.
The quake prompted a tsunami watch for Haiti, Cuba, the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, the Pacific Tsunami Center said.
A major earthquake, of magnitude 7 or higher, is capable of causing widespread and heavy damage.
There was no immediate report of casualties.
