Jacmel, Haiti (CNN) -- Much was lost in the town of Jacmel, Haiti's cultural center.
The huge, colorful paper mache floats for Carnival, just 10 days away, are crushed.
The mountains of sheet music for the classes at Ecole Musique are scattered in the rubble of a street named La Berenthe, the labyrinth.
Left behind are crushed limbs and brain injuries, nursed in an open-air hospital that replaced the real one.
But intrepid Jacmel residents got out word they needed help through the Internet, texts, Facebook and YouTube.
