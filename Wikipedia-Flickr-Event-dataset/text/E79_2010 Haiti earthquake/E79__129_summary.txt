Advertisement Haiti's government can lead efforts to rebuild the country in the wake of its devastating earthquake, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive has said.
But Mr Bellerive told a meeting of world officials in the Canadian city of Montreal that "massive support" from the international community was needed.
But Canadian Prime Stephen Harper warned that it would take a decade to rebuild Haiti.
"It was not an exaggeration to say that at least 10 years of hard work awaits the world in Haiti," Mr Harper said.
Guido Bertolaso described the international aid operation as "a terrible situation that could have been managed much better".
