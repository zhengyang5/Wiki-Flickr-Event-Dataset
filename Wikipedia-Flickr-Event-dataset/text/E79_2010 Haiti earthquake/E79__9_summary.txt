PARIS: Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot, the archbishop of Port-au-Prince, has been killed in the Haiti earthquake.
Missionaries at the archdiocese found his body crushed by rubble in the ruins of his office, said the Rev Pierre Le Beller of the Saint Jacques Missionary Centre in western France.
The Saint Jacques order of missionary priests was officially founded in 1951 by the bishop of Gonaives, Haiti.
He was consecrated a bishop in 1997, and named deputy to the archbishop of Port-au-Prince, a title he held until being named archbishop himself in 2008.
"He was a demanding, and understanding, priest," said the Rev Michel Menard, also of the Saint Jacques mission, who met regularly with Miot in Haiti.
