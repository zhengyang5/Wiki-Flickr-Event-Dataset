The events in Haiti this week have been truly shocking.
Many space agencies have signed up to something called the International Charter [on] Space and Major Disasters.
When the Charter is activated, the signatories re-task their satellites to get the data most urgently needed in a devastated region.
It's being used to identify roads and major public buildings reported to have been damaged.
These satellites have a radar capability, which, unlike optical sensors, sees the ground whatever the weather.
