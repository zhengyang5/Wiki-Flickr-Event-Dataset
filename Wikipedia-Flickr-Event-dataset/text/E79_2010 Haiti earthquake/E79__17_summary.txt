By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC NewsIt was immediately obvious that Tuesday's quake in Haiti would be an appalling natural disaster.
This was a large tremor centred on an impoverished country with little recent experience or preparedness for such an event.
How earthquakes happen Seismic data suggests Tuesday's quake was on the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault.
The US Geological Survey says the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault has been the likely source of historical large tremors in 1860, 1770, 1761, 1751, 1684, 1673, and 1618.
Reports suggest that in this latest event, the surface along the fault may have been offset in places by a metre or so.
