This year four hurricanes hit Haiti, leaving 800 dead and a country drowning.
The four tropical storms, ending with September's Hurricane Ike, turned Haiti into a wasteland.
Nearly 800 people died, about 60% of the country's harvest was destroyed and entire cities were rendered desolate and uninhabitable.
"When there are no longer any dead on the streets, people tend to forget," President Rene Preval recently told reporters.
This leaves Haiti extremely vulnerable because even light rain can wash away the crumbly topsoil, triggering mudslides and flash floods.
