FRENCH doctors treating earthquake victims in Haiti say they've never seen so many people seriously injured, and are having to carry out hundreds of amputations.
Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders, MSF) have carried out caesarians and amputations.
MSF's experienced medical staff say they have never seen so many people with such serious injuries,'' the group said in a statement issued in Paris today.
"Unfortunately, we are carrying out an enormous number of amputations,'' said one surgeon quoted in a statement by the group.
