In Search Of The Red Cross' $500 Million In Haiti ReliefWhen a devastating earthquake leveled Haiti in 2010, millions of people donated to the American Red Cross.
The American Red Cross vowed to help Haitians rebuild, but after five years the Red Cross' legacy in Haiti is not new roads, or schools, or hundreds of new homes.
The Red Cross long has been known for providing emergency disaster relief — food, blankets and shelter to people in need.
"For the American Red Cross and the Red Cross in general, shelter has been a priority," says Meltzer, adding that the Red Cross has "provided homes for more than 130,000 Haitians.
These days the American Red Cross is preparing to leave Haiti — it's handing over operations to the Haitian Red Cross next year.
