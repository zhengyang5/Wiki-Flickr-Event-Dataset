How much has been spent on emergency relief programmes, and how much on longer-term reconstruction projects?
Figures released by the UN special envoy for Haiti show that only 53% of the nearly $4.5bn pledged for reconstruction projects in 2010 and 2011 has been delivered.
In contrast, while money for reconstruction has been relatively slow in coming, more pledged for emergency relief work has materialised.
In a country sometimes dubbed a "republic of NGOs", only 6% of bilateral aid for reconstruction projects has gone through Haitian institutions, according to UN figures.
