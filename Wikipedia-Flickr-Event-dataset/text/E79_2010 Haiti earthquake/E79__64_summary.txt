The unpublished report puts the death toll between 46,000 and 85,000.
It also suggests many of those still living in tent cities did not lose their homes in the disaster.
USAID Haiti Mission Director Carleene Dei told the BBC: "Any comment on the death toll of the tragic earthquake of January 2010 that affected so many is beyond the scope of the commission and purely reflects the views of the author."
Analysts say the draft report, which USAID commissioned through the Washington consulting firm LTL Strategies, could challenge the premise of a multi-billion-dollar aid and reconstruction effort.
The number of those killed and displaced by the earthquake in Haiti prompted an outpouring of aid for the country, including a $5.5bn (Â£3.3bn) pledge during a UN donor conference last year.
