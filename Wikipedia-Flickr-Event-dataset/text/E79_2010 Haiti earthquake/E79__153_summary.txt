Officials say tolls have averaged out to around 50 new reported deaths a day [REUTERS]The cholera death toll in Haiti is rising daily, with official figures indicating that 3,333 people have died since the outbreak of the epidemic in mid-October.
Official sources state that, as a result of cholera, the numbers have averaged out to around 50 new reported deaths a day.
The total number of cholera infections has soared to 150,000; newest data from December 26 noted 432 more deaths than previous health ministry statistics.
Cholera, which causes deadly diarrhoea and vomiting, often affects poor countries with limited access to clean water and proper sanitation.
The Pan-American Health Organisation in early December estimated Haiti could see up to 400,000 cholera cases over the next 12 months, half of them within three months alone.
