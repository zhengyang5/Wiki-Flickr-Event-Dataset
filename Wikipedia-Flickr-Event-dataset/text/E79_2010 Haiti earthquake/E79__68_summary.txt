However, in neighboring Haiti, where the epicenter was located, the situation was total disaster as the earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale struck.
From the early morning hours today [Wednesday, January 13] the authorities, businesses, and the Dominican military joined forces to mobilize humanitarian help for the Haiti earthquake.
The Dominican team help send food and bottled water, and sent heavy machinery to help remove the rubble.
Aqu√≠ se paran las diferencias absurdas y se impone la solidaridad pura y simple.
The Dominican people have bent over backwards to help Haiti.
