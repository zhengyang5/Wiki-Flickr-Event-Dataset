Amid sporadic looting and pleas from local police for backup, the U.S. military said Monday that the bottleneck slowing aid distribution in Haiti's capital is easing, with more flights moving through the city's airport and the seaport expected to reopen later this week.
About 100 flights a day are now landing, up from 60 last week, said the U.S. military spokesman in Haiti, Cmdr.
"In terms of aid, it's the port where we can bring most of the aid," Araud said.
World leaders have promised massive amounts of assistance to rebuild Haiti since Tuesday's quake killed as many as 200,000 people and left its capital, Port-au-Prince, in ruins.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, arrived Monday in Port-au-Price, bringing aid supplies and being briefed on Haiti's needs.
