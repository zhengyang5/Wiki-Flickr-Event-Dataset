25 Jan 2010 20:49:19 GMTSource: Reuters* Trade minister says 20 pct jobs gone* Says Haiti created 28,000 jobs last year* Haiti put years of corruption behind it- ministerBy Patricia ZengerlePORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The earthquake that killed up to 200,000 Haitians and left millions homeless also had a devastating toll on the country's economy -- eliminating as many as one in five jobs, the trade minister said on Monday.
"We have maybe lost 20 percent," Trade and Industry Minister Josseline Colimon Fethiere said in an interview.
The quake came at a particularly bitter time for the hemisphere's poorest country because it had been enjoying a relative revival.
On the afternoon of Jan. 12, Fethiere was at her desk in Port-au-Prince giving an interview to a newspaper from the Dominican Republic about recent improvements in the Haitian economy.
"I was telling them that since last year we had created 28,000 jobs, and had some new foreign investment, almost $100 million," she said.
