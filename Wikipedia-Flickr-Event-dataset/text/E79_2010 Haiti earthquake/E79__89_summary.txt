PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI -- Medical teams struggled to cope with an overwhelming crush of injured patients in this earthquake-ravaged city Sunday, while an international armada of would-be helpers vied in frustration for access to the disaster zone.
The French-based group Doctors Without Borders issued a public call that its planes "be allowed to land" at the Port-au-Prince international airport, "in order to treat thousands of wounded waiting for vital surgical operations."
Since Wednesday night, the staff at the field hospital has grown from three doctors to 87 personnel.
On the patio, patients hooked up to intravenous lines filled the rows of new cots as soon as they were in place.
We're just scratching the surface," said Dr. Eduardo de Marchena, a cardiologist taking a break from operating on patients.
