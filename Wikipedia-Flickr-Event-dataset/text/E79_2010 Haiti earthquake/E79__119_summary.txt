PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Ten American missionaries were charged Thursday in quake-hit Haiti with child abduction and criminal conspiracy, but should not be sent for trial in the United States, officials said.
They were formally charged with “kidnapping minors and criminal association” on Thursday according to their lawyer Edwin Coq.
The group could now face nine years in prison on child kidnapping charges and further jail time for conspiracy.
“It is absolutely impossible to carry out the trial for the Americans in Haiti right now.
Earlier government prosecutor Mazan Fortil said it was not yet clear if the 10 could be tried in the Haiti.
