(Yogi) Huyghebaert today announced the province of Saskatchewan is donating $250,000 to assist the people of Haiti.
The minister also extended thanks to the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan for donating $500,000 to Haiti relief funds and matching donations made by their 5,000 employees.
"Saskatchewan people and their generous spirit have always stepped up to the plate to help those in need," Huyghebaert said.
"I urge all people in our province to continue to do what comes naturally to people here - give to those needing assistance."
Other Saskatchewan efforts include the Saskatchewan Day of Caring for Haiti, a radio-thon by News Talk Radio for the Red Cross on January 20.
