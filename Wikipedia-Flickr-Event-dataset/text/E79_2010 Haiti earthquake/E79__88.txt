FRENCH doctors treating earthquake victims in Haiti say they've never seen so many people seriously injured, and are having to carry out hundreds of amputations.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders, MSF) have carried out caesarians and amputations.

MSF's experienced medical staff say they have never seen so many people with such serious injuries,'' the group said in a statement issued in Paris today.

Another French aid group, Medecins du Monde, says it will have to perform amputatations on hundreds of people whose limbs have been crushed in the earthquake, and its doctors have no electricity to work by.

"Unfortunately, we are carrying out an enormous number of amputations,'' said one surgeon quoted in a statement by the group. He expects about "400 (amputations) over the coming days''.

"Conditions are very precarious. We have no electricity or telephone network,'' he said.

MSF cited its emergency coordinator Hans van Dillen as saying that crowds arrived almost immediately when the group opened an emergency hospital at Carrefour, a poor district near the town of Leogane.

"Patients arrived on handcarts or on men's backs. There are other hospitals in the area, but they are already unable to cope with the number of injured and have limited resources of personnel and medicines and equipment,'' he said.

MSF already had 30 volunteers working in Haiti when the quake struck and has since been able to send in another 70 international workers to the capital.

It said its work is being seriously hampered by disruptions at Port-au-Prince's airport, and made an urgent call to speed up the landing of planes carrying medical supplies, after one carrying an inflatable field hospital was turned away on Saturday night.
