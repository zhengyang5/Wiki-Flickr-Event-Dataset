The UN spokeswoman Elizabeth Byrs says 132 people have been rescued since the earthquake 11 days ago.
Speaking in Geneva, Ms Byrs said that the decision to end the rescue operation was "heartbreaking" but that it had been taken on the advice of experts.
She said most search and rescue teams would now be leaving Haiti, although some with heavy lifting equipment may stay to help with the clean-up operation and with aid distribution.
Few funeral services have been held in Haiti for those killed by the quake.
"Haiti's entire supply chain infrastructure has been devastated, and we have been faced with launching an operation from scratch."
