A strong aftershock has rocked Haiti, sending screaming people running into the streets, eight days after another quake devastated the country.
Despite an international aid operation, supplies are slow to reach survivors.
However, international teams are still rescuing people alive from the rubble, including a 69-year-old woman pulled from the ruins of a church in the capital.
The United Nations said early on Wednesday that 121 people had been rescued by international teams since the 12 January earthquake - an extra 31 people on Tuesday.
Everywhere there are volunteers filling some of the gaps created by the slow arrival of international aid.
