BY KING QUILLEN Before her January journey to Haiti, Mary Ann Loafman would not speculate about the destruction she would find. Back in Indialantic in February, tears flowed easier than words when she and other Hearts Out to Haiti mission members described the destruction they had seen. The Holy Name of Jesus team visited what remained of two mountain parishes it supports, Les Palmes and Morne a Chandelle. The road to the third, Durissy, was impassable, but its priest relayed information. “It was a war zone,” Loafman said. Her husband, Jim, called the destruction “overwhelming.” About 64,000 people lived in the three agricul- tural parishes. When the magnitude-7 earthquake hit, many were in the fields, so were relatively safe. But churches, chapels and at least 8,000 homes were destroyed. One cultural treasure did survive. From the rubble of the Les Palmes church, parishioners pulled a sign of faith and a symbol of hope, a painting that had hung by the altar for 25 years. They donated the painting for mission members to use in earthquake relief fundraising. During the mission, team members worked in the villages and also purchased bulk supplies of beans and rice to help support the villagers while crops mature. The Loafmans will return for a longer stay in March to coordinate future missions, establish temporary housing and organize work on perma- nent homes. They hope to help their villages regain some sense of normalcy. “Especially for the children,” Mary Ann Loafman said. “The children have been so shocked. There’s no joy in their eyes.” Hearts Out to Haiti wish list For information, call Wanda Cordelli at 321-777-0158 or Angela Romano at 321-724-1388. * Afour-wheel-drive diesel truck to haul supplies to the three mountain villages, end- ing $500-a-day rental charges. * Tents to sleep four or more, tarps, blankets (not com- forters that use precious cargo space) and sheets. * Money.
