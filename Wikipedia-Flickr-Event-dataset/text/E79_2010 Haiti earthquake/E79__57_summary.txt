A generous estimate now would put the total number of people buried in Haiti so far at close to 52,000.
Even then the death toll would still not surpass 92,000.
When questions about the death toll are put to government officials they have a remarkable effect, for no one seems to be responsible for the official body count.
The United Nations says it is not conducting any independent research into the Haitian death toll.
It says it will go by the official Haitian figures for the time being.
