A medical group today said one of its planes was turned away from Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, despite guarantees given by the UN and the US defence department.
MSF doctors say they have never seen so many serious injuries as those sustained by victims of Haiti's earthquake.
Surgical units set up by Médecins sans Frontières in Port-au-Prince have been working around the clock to treat large numbers of patients.
In Trinite, MSF teams are treating people under canvas in the grounds of a clinic damaged by the earthquake, which is believed to have killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people.
MSF teams say the lack of food and water is contributing to tension in the city.
