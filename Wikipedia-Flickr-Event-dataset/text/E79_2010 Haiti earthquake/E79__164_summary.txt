Jan 9, 2013 (CIDRAP News) – The death toll in Haiti's cholera epidemic is approaching 8,000, and more than 6% of Haitians have had the disease since it invaded the country in October 2010, according to reports released this week.
Haiti accounted for 57% of all cholera cases and 53% of cholera deaths reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, the report says.
Within days after the epidemic began, the Haitian government launched a special surveillance effort, the National Cholera Surveillance System (NCSS), according to the report.
They say the WHO estimates that 3 million to 5 million cholera cases occur each year, taking 100,000 to 200,000 lives, though the reported numbers are much lower, they say.
