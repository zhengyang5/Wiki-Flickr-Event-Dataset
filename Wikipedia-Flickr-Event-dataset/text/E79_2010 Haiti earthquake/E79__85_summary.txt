Added to the heartbreak in quake-ravaged Haiti is the uncertain fate of tens of thousands of newly orphaned children.
As aid workers scrambled to set up child-friendly zones in Port-au-Prince, a string of relief groups called for a moratorium yesterday on new adoptions.
They fear the potential for children to be whisked out of the country before they could be reunited with their families.
This week, U.S. officials waived visa requirements for Haitian children already on the path to adoption.
Even before the quake, adopting Haitian children was thorny due to the number of kids in orphanages who still have parents.
