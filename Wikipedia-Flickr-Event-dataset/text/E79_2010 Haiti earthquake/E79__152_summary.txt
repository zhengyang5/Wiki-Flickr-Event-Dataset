The report cited gang-related violence and cases of women trading sex for food.
Sexual violence was a “serious problem” in Haiti before the earthquake, Nesirky said.
“Living in squalid, overcrowded and spontaneous camps for a prolonged period has aggravated levels of violence and appalling standards of living,” the Refugees International report said.
Refugees International said the handling of food aid in Haiti has contributed to problems for women.
This has created the problem of other women feeling the need to trade sex for food, the report said.
