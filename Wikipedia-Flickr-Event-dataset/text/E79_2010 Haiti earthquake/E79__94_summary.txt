Colonel Buck Elton, commander of the U.S. military directing flights at Haiti’s airport, said there had been 600 take-offs and landings since he took over the one-runway airport’s traffic on Wednesday, though 50 flights had been diverted.
The airport’s control tower was knocked out by the quake and U.S. military air controllers were operating from a radio post on the airfield grass, he said.
“What we set up here would be similar to running a major airport ... without any communications, electricity or computers,” Elton told reporters in a telephone briefing from Port-au-Prince.
“Priority must be given immediately to planes carrying lifesaving equipment and medical personnel,” MSF (Doctors Without Borders) said in a statement.
The airport apron can only handle one wide-bodied plane and five narrow-bodied planes at a time, plus other aircraft that can be parked on the grass.
