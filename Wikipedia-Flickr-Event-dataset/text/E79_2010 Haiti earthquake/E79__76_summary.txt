Everyone's been reporting about how social networking sites like Facebook have become the primary form of communication during the devastating earthquake in Haiti this week.
UPDATE: Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said in an email to me in "very rare cases" some Facebook users in Haiti are encountering the system's automatic response to prevent spam.
If you're in Haiti and your entire profile has been blocked, contact Facebook here.
Noyes also said the Facebook team will be looking through the system for the term "Haiti" and will expedite those requests.
"We're looking into the behavior we're seeing out of Haiti to analyze how our systems might be improved," he said.
