Video from a North Carolina rally on Wednesday shows a white Trump supporter punching a black protester in the face.
They’re saying what Mr. Trump can’t.
It doesn’t take clairvoyance, or even tremendous mental dexterity, to see what Mr. Trump means by “make America great again.” It just takes a history book.
Mr. Trump is a cipher; his voters love him because he does nothing but hold up a mirror to their basest prejudices and bask in the feedback loop of narcissism.
They’re not “afraid”; they’re leading Mr. Trump as much as following him.
