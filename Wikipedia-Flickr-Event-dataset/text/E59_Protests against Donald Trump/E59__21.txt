Michael Steven Sandford could face about two years in a US prison and be deported for his pleas on Tuesday to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function.

The 20-year-old Sandford could have faced up to 20 years in prison if he had been convicted at trial of both charges.

Court documents say Sandford acknowledged reaching for the gun while Trump was on stage 18 June at a Las Vegas strip hotel-casino.

Sandford did not get hold of the gun before he was arrested, and no shots were fired.

The documents say Sandford later told a federal agent that he drove from California to Las Vegas with a plan to kill Trump.

Family attorney Saimo Chahal says Sandford was delusional at the time.
