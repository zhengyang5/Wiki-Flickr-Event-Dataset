Hundreds in Bay Area protest Trump’s decision on DACANow Playing:About 1,000 demonstrators streamed into the plaza outside the Federal Building in San Francisco’s South of Market district Tuesday evening to protest President Trump’s decision to phase out an executive order that had protected from deportation many young adults who were brought to the U.S. by their undocumented immigrant parents.
The protesters rallied outside the building at Seventh and Mission streets.
Across the bay, about 200 demonstrators gathered in UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza and marched down Telegraph Avenue.
The San Francisco crowd spilled into the street outside the Federal Building, shutting down traffic on Seventh Street between Mission and Market streets and shutting Mission Street between Seventh and Fifth.
Through a bullhorn, a series of speakers denounced Trump’s decision.
