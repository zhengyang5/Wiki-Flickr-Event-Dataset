"We can fight Trump's policies, we can fight that division," Mr Courtney added.

Dawn Butler, MP for Brent Central, told the crowds that Mrs May needed to "understand the responsibility" of the UK's relationship with the US.

They chanted "Donald Trump has got to go" and "No ban, no wall" as they went.
