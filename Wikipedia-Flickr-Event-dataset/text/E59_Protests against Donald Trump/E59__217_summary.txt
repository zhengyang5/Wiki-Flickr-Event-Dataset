Story highlights Donald Trump has been ensconced in New Jersey for a 17-day working vacationThe President returned temporarily to Washington and spoke publicly(CNN) Even the walls of Donald Trump's private New Jersey golf club weren't enough to shield the President from the withering criticism he endured for 48 hours this weekend.
It was clear to some aides shortly after Trump's vague statement on Saturday -- where the President blamed "many sides" for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia -- that the President would have to say more.
The criticism, from both Democrats and Republicans, was swift and direct.
And every 140-character message Trump sent afterward only further intensified the heat on the President.
The pressure, at this point palpable inside the White House, came to a head-on Monday in Washington, where Trump stepped to a podium and delivered a statement straight to camera.
