A Twitter account which claims to be revealing leaks from inside the White House has amassed more than half a million followers.

The unverified account @RoguePOTUSStaff purports to be leaking information from inside the White House and concerns about the behaviour of new US President Donald Trump.

Its bio reads: “The unofficial resistance team inside the White House. We will block anyone who asks us to ID ourselves (including press), or who makes suggestions of violence.”

The account has posted a string of tweets claiming to have inside information about Prime Minister Theresa May and her visit to meet the US president last weekend.

One tweet referring to her trip to the US read: “POTUS was dismissive of PM May. ‘I hope she’ll like us, but she doesn’t have much to offer.’"

Another post said: “Assessment is that a post Brexit PM May needs POTUS more than POTUS needs her. ‘She does what we want, or we go somewhere else’."

The account was set up on January 26 and has gathered 570,000 followers in a week.

It has also accused Mr Trump of being “fully overwhelmed” by his first week in the job and claimed he was overheard yelling: “Don’t they know I’m the f****** president?”

The account has also posted tweets that have sparked rumours Mr Trump is planning to sign an anti-LGBT executive order by the end of the week.
