CLOSE Thousands of people take to the streets of London to protest against President Donald Trump's anti-immigration decree and his potential state visit to Britain.
Some of the biggest protests took place in New York City and Washington, D.C., with large rallies planned in San Francisco and Los Angles later in the day.
Organizing under the social media hashtag #NoBanNoWall, protesters said they wanted to again demonstrate their commitment to protecting vulnerable communities.
Small protests also took place at airports around the country.
The president and first lady Melania Trump are expected to attend a Red Cross ball at the club Saturday night.
