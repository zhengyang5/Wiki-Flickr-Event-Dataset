Protesters attacked Donald Trump supporters on the sidelines of a San Jose rally Thursday night, in a raucous scene where a dozen or more people were punched and at least one woman was pelted with an egg.
Protesters also reportedly grabbed Trump hats from supporters and set the hats on fire on the ground.
Mixed accounts emerged overnight over to what extent the Trump supporters were taunting the protesters.
Some banged on the cars of Trump supporters as they left the rally and chased after those on foot to frighten them.
"Our police officers have done an extremely courageous and professional job so far," San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo told The Associated Press by phone.
