Hundreds of San Diegans came out to Downtown San Diego on Sunday to call for President Donald Trump's impeachment, saying the president was a dangerous man who abuses his power.
From his campaign's ties to Russia to his "unpresidential behavior," opponents say Trump is bad for the country.
Other protesters, like Marianne Johnson, a San Carlos resident, said they believed Trump was a dangerous person to have in office.
Trump supporters also attended the rally, bringing signs saying "Build the wall, Enforce the law!"
Organizers say San Diego's rally attendance ranked second, after Los Angeles' attendance.
