April 22 is Earth Day, first celebrated in 1970.
The original Earth Day is seen by many as a turning point in the environmental movement.
For one, it isnâ€™t focused solely on environmental science but all disciplines from astronomy to zoology.
In fact, the march was inspired by a Congress and president that appear hostile to science, particularly in regards to climate change.
The march comes amid a flurry of other unrelated efforts by researchers to rally around science.
