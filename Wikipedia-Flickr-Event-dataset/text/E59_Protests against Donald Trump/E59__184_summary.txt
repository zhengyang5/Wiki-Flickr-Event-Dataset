The group behind the March for Science in Washington just announced in a tweet that they will rally on April 22 -- Earth Day.
The March for Science will take place on April 22, 2017.
We hope to see you in D.C. and around the world!
Organizers want the march to be a nonpartisan protest that champion support and funding for science, science-based policy and diversity.
They're worried about the new administration's stance on climate change, energy policy and other issues.
