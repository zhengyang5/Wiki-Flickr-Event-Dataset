"He Will Not Divide Us" Shia LaBeouf's Donald Trump protest has been shut down.

The protest's host, the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City, has shut off the camera that live-streamed LaBeouf's protest, called "He Will Not Divide Us," due to concerns that the protest had become a "flashpoint for violence."

"The Museum of the Moving Image has closed HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US, a participatory internet streaming performance by LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner," the museum said in a statement to press.

"The installation created a serious and ongoing public safety hazard for the Museum, its visitors, staff, local residents, and businesses," it continued. "The installation had become a flashpoint for violence and was disrupted from its original intent."

Additionally, LaBeouf tweeted an image on Friday stating, "The museum has abandoned us."

The "Transformers" star was arrested in the protest's first week for allegedly getting into a fight with a man, pulling on his scarf, and scratching him. There had been other reports of violence at the site, as well.

Originally planned to last four years, the length of Trump's presidential term, LaBeouf's protest lasted about three weeks. He began live-streaming it on January 20.
