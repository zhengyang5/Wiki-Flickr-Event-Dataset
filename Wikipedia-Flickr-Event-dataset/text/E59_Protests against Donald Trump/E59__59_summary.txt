Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of several US cities following Trump's election, including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Los Angeles, Seattle, Oakland and Portland.
Most demonstrations have been peaceful but some led to arrests and incidents of violence.
The advisory did not specifically mention Trump but said the unrest began after Tuesday's elections.
"Sometimes the protests turn violent and criminal while protesters (are) detained by security forces," the ministry of foreign affairs said Saturday, adding that "racists and xenophobic incidents increased in USA."
