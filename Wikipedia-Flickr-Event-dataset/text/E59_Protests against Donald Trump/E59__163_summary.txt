LOS ANGELES, CA - Just a few days after the massive Women's March, rallies are again being organized to protest US President Donald Trump, with many Pinoys joining the mass action.
Women activists again gathered for what they called "Resist Trump Tuesdays."
"There are movements going on around the country every single Tuesday to let Trump know we will not go quietly.
"Our concern is all the people he's appointing to these offices that don't have the ability or understanding like what education department is what the health department is.
DeVos, who is a billionaire like Trump, is hounded by conflict-of-interest allegations because of her ties to several education companies.
