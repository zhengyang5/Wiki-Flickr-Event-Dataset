Last week, Democratic North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp made her feelings known about the anti-Trump resistance movement.
The senator was speaking to the Greater North Dakota Chamber of Commerce last Friday, where a question about health care was asked.
She also said that she doesnâ€™t share that view and added that Democratic Sens.
But the real obstacle that she said faces Congress on anything is the anti-Trump Resist movement, which, unlike the Tea Party, just wants Democrats to stop anything Trump does.
Love them or hate them, the Tea Party pushed for smaller government, lower taxes, and less wasteful spending.
