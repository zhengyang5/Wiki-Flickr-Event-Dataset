But in some states, the reaction from state legislators is turning hostile.
A wave of bills aimed at curtailing protests and demonstrations has started to make its way through state legislatures across the country.
A Washington Post analysis found at least 18 states where Republican legislators have either proposed legislation that targets certain protest tactics, sought to increase penalties for illegal protests under existing law, or publicly discussed pursuing such measures.
(The Obama administration briefly halted construction in response to those protests; the Trump administration reversed that decision last month.)
On Monday, the Republican speaker of the Arizona House said he wouldnâ€™t hear the measure, effectively killing the bill.
