"Can't wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS," one anonymous National Park Service employee posted on the newly opened Twitter account @AltNatParkService.
"You can take our official twitter, but you'll never take our free time!"
Not an official Nasa account."
The resistance movement gained steam on Tuesday when a series of climate change-related tweets were posted to the official Twitter account of Badlands National Park in South Dakota, administered under the Interior Department, but were soon deleted.
Because the Twitter feeds were set up and posted to anonymously as private accounts, they are beyond the control of the government.
