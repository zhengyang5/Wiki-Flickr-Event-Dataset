Here's Trump on Tuesday evening in response to flare-ups at GOP town halls in recent days.
The implication is that the protesters aren't really regular-Joe citizens, but political activists sometimes appearing at multiple town halls to cause a scene and make the movement appear bigger than it is.
Update: Now Sean Spicer, echoing Trump, says, "It is a loud group, small group of people disrupting something, in many cases, for media attention."
The problem with town hall protests is that they are, by nature, defined by anecdotes and the viral nature of a limited number of heated exchanges.
That said, it's just so difficult to know where to draw the line between flashy protests at town halls and legitimate, game-changing shifts in the political zeitgeist.
