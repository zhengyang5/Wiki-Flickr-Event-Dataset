The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration.
The rogue National Park Service account @AltNatParkSer has attracted even more people, with more than a million followers after less than 300 tweets.
There are also rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
On Tuesday the official account of Badlands National Park in South Dakota started tweeting about global warming, but those posts were later deleted.
The people behind the @AltNatParkSer told us this inspired them to set up their Twitter account.
