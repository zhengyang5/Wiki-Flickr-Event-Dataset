The Pepsi ad plays up the point by having Ms. Jenner’s character arrive at the protest straight from what appears to be a fashion photo shoot.
In so doing, the company is positioning Ms. Jenner as a successor to the supermodel Cindy Crawford, who appeared in a famous Pepsi ad in 1992.
(“Goals,” Ms. Jenner tweeted last week, with a picture of Ms. Crawford in Pepsi regalia.)
Nor is it the first time Ms. Jenner has, intentionally or not, courted controversy.
In 2015, some observers accused her of cultural appropriation for wearing her hair in cornrows, a historically black style.
