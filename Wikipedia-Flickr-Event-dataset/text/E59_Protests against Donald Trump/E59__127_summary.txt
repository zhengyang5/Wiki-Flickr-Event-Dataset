WASHINGTON -- Most of the approximately 230 protesters arrested on Inauguration Day will be charged with felony rioting, federal prosecutors said.
The office said most of those arrested will be released without having to post bail and must return to court in February.
The arrests took place in a four-block stretch of downtown Washington around the time of President Trump’s swearing-in ceremony.
