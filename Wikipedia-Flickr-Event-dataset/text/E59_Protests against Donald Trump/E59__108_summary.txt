As a result, some of these accounts have quickly amassed huge followings — 1.25 million for the most famous one, @AltNatParkSer.
But less attention has been paid to the sharing dynamic that has helped these accounts blow up in the first place.
People who share these accounts and their tweets desperately want it to be the case that some brave government staffers are tweeting their resistance to the Trump agenda.
Many, if not most, of the people helping disseminate these unverified “rogue” accounts have probably griped about how easily misinformation spread about Clinton.
