During his visit to Warsaw, Poland while on a trip to the G20 summit in Germany, President Donald Trump was met with an unconventional, yet powerful crowd. Among a group of demonstrators were a clutch of women dressed in bright crimson robes and white bonnets familiar to fans of "The Handmaids Tale"

The protest took place at Krasinskich Square in the central district of Warsaw where large groups of supporters came to welcome Trump.

Their costumes — inspired by the handmaids in Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel and the Hulu show based on it — come as a response to the Trump administration's policies on women's rights, from reproductive rights to health care coverage. In Atwood's 1985 novel, women have few (if any) civil rights and "handmaids" are essentially sex slaves used for the sole purpose of reproduction.
