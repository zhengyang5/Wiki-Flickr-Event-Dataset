WASHINGTON - Even though she knows it's a longshot, Lynn Gavigan of Strongsville thinks it's worth trying to impeach President Donald Trump.
The Cleveland event organized by IndivisibleCLE is among several dozen pro-impeachment rallies to be held in Washington and around the country that day.
"This will broadcast that there are grounds for impeachment and the Republicans in Congress who are protecting him need to go in 2018," Gavigan said.
Now a commentator on FoxNews, Kucinich pooh-poohs the current calls to impeach Trump.
"It is destructive to America to proceed with an impeachment at this stage of the presidency," Kucinich told FoxNews.
