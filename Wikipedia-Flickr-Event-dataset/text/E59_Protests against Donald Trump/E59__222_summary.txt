During a rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, President Donald Trump once again hinted he may pardon former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
But Sheriff Joe should feel good," President Donald Trump said.
"Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?"
He even called on Trump to reschedule his visit, saying, "If President Trump is coming to Phoenix to announce a pardon for former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, then it will be clear that his true intent is to inflame emotions and further divide our nation."
But White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said before Tuesday's rally Trump wouldn't be announcing a pardon that day.
