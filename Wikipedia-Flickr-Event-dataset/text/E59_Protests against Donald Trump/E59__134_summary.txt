"He Will Not Divide Us" Shia LaBeouf's Donald Trump protest has been shut down.
The protest's host, the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City, has shut off the camera that live-streamed LaBeouf's protest, called "He Will Not Divide Us," due to concerns that the protest had become a "flashpoint for violence."
"The Museum of the Moving Image has closed HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US, a participatory internet streaming performance by LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner," the museum said in a statement to press.
Originally planned to last four years, the length of Trump's presidential term, LaBeouf's protest lasted about three weeks.
