Washington (CNN) Six police officers were injured and 217 protesters arrested Friday after a morning of peaceful protests and coordinated disruptions of Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony gave way to ugly street clashes in downtown Washington.
Demonstrators protest against US President-elect Donald Trump before his inauguration on January 20, 2017, in Washington, DC.
"This checkpoint is closed," they chanted, forcing Trump supporters to turn back and walk along Indiana Avenue in search of a clearer path.
The disruption was compounded when, much as it happened at Trump's campaign rallies, his supporters responded, erupting in shouts of "Trump, Trump, Trump!"
In Sydney, anti-Trump protesters and Trump supporters spilled into the city's streets Saturday to protest the US President.
