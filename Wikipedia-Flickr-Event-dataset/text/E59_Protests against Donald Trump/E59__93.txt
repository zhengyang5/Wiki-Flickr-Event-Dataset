Since taking office last week, President Trump has been ordering the removal of scientific data from government websites (example: Ordering the EPA to remove their website's page on climate change). In response, a handful of people at these government bodies have reportedly been launching unauthorized, rogue Twitter accounts in an effort to preserve the flow of information.

According to Reuters,

Employees at the EPA and the departments of Interior, Agriculture and Health and Human Services have…confirmed seeing notices from the new administration either instructing them to remove web pages or limit how they communicate to the public, including through social media.

The restrictions have reinforced concerns that Trump, a climate change skeptic, is out to squelch federally backed research showing that emissions from fossil fuel combustion and other human activities are contributing to global warming.

Employees from more than a dozen U.S. government agencies have [thus] established a network of unofficial "rogue" Twitter feeds in defiance of what they see as attempts by President Donald Trump to muzzle federal climate change research and other science.

The problem is that we have to take these accounts at face value, as there is no way to verify who's behind each; and the larger agencies like NASA and the EPA have multiple rogue accounts.

In any case, digital advocacy strategist and consultant Alice Stollmeyer, who has dubbed this Twitter resistance movement "#twistance," has compiled an exhaustive list of every agency she could find. We've reformatted it here for you and listed each organization's self-description. (Please note that some of these accounts label themselves "parody" or "not affiliated with" in an effort to skirt prosecution).
