Organizers also used the occasion to celebrate the “resistance” movement against the Trump administration, and implored the crowd to stay involved for the long haul.
The participants carried signs that called for Trump’s impeachment and depicted Trump as a puppet being controlled by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
