President Donald Trump accused former President Barack Obama of being "behind" the protests that Republican members of Congress have encountered at town hall meetings across the country.
Trump is then asked, "Do you believe President Obama is behind it, and if he is, is that a violation of the so-called unsaid president's code?"
"I think that President Obama is probably behind it, because his people are certainly behind it," Trump added.
Organizing for Action's website links to the Town Hall Project, a separate, open-source group that compiles a list of events featuring lawmakers and encourages citizens to attend.
The Town Hall Project's list includes events with both Republican and Democratic legislators.
