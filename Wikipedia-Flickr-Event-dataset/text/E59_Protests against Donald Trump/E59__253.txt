Donald Trump and the GOP would have the American public believe that immigrants pose a threat to our country.



But we’ve been tracking the number of hate incidents that have targeted immigrants since Trump was inaugurated a little over two months ago, and it’s clear that the opposite is true: this country is a threat to them.

The fear gripping immigrant communities is well-founded, affecting every region of the country, from small towns and suburbs to large metropolitan areas long championed for their diversity.

We obviously can’t definitively link Trump’s rise to power with every single incident here, but there’s no debating the fact that hate crimes have spiked all over the country since he first started campaigning for the presidency.

This timeline was compiled using data from ProPublica’s Documenting Hate Project. The project is collecting reports to create a national database of hate crimes and bias incidents for use by journalists and civil-rights organizations. If you’ve been a victim or a witness, you can submit evidence here.

Though Islamophobia and xenophobia are not interchangeable terms or experiences, we looked at both categories for this timeline since so many anti-Muslim incidents are rooted in the false belief that Muslims are always foreigners. In many of these events, the victims were told they should “go back to their countries”—even if they were born here.

This is obviously just a partial list. We stuck to what we felt we could verify, and there’s no way of tabulating the countless incidents of unreported harassment that immigrants face in America. But it’s a small glimpse into what people are enduring every single day.

We’re going to keep updating this list. If there’s an incident we missed, or if you hear of anything new, please leave a comment or get in touch with us by filling out our Documenting Hate form.
