Americans spent $4.1 million on poster and foam boards from Jan. 15 to Jan. 21 ($2.2 million for poster boards and $1.9 for foam) in the run-up to President Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent protests, according to research firm NPD Group.
Poster boards were up 33% week over week and paint marker purchases rose 35% in the same time.
Protests have occurred with consistent frequency in recent months, especially after Donald Trump claimed the presidency in November.
About 100 employees around the U.S. lost their jobs after the demonstration for not coming into work, according to the Atlantic.
Pro-immigrant protests also occurred at the end of January, after President Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering or returning to the U.S.
