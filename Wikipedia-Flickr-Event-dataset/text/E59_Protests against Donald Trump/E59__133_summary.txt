Above it is the name of the newest LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner art project, "HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US."
That orb is a camera connected to a 24/7 livestream, an invitation for anyone anywhere to bear witness.
Of course, Shia LeBeouf's star power draw crowds when he's there, so my second visit had a very different vibe.
Perhaps Trump will try to rip the camera off the wall — after all, he's no fan of the arts.
But at the moment, for the first time since the inauguration, I'm looking forward to seeing what tomorrow will bring.
