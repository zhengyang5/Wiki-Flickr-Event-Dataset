This year's May Day protests are already being billed as the biggest immigrant strike since 2006.
Instead, activists from Puente, LUCHA, and Fight for $15 will be leading a protest at the Arizona Capitol, followed by a march to the Fourth Avenue jail.
If February's Day Without An Immigrant is any indication, not many people will end up calling out of work.
In the days that followed, reports of workers being fired for failing to show up that day emerged around the country.
Not to mention, many of them simply can't afford to take a day off work.
