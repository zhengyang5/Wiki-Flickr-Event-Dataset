What is the #MarchForTruth?
#MarchForTruth seeks to ensure the investigations continue unobstructed, and to demand the answers that the American people deserve to restore faith in our democracy.
Today experts are increasingly concerned that President Donald Trump wants to remove Special Counsel Robert Mueller or severely limit his investigation.
#MarchForTruth is coordinating efforts to prepare a response in the event that this assault on the rule of law does indeed take place.
#MarchForTruth calls on citizens to raise their voices and let our elected leaders know that Americans want answers.
