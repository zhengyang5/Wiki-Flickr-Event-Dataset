"We can fight Trump's policies, we can fight that division," Mr Courtney added.
Dawn Butler, MP for Brent Central, told the crowds that Mrs May needed to "understand the responsibility" of the UK's relationship with the US.
She added: "The answer isn't walls and the answer isn't bans".
The crowds marched down Park Lane - filling the length of the famous London street - and along Piccadilly towards Downing Street.
They chanted "Donald Trump has got to go" and "No ban, no wall" as they went.
