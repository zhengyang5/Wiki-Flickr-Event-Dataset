Los Angeles (CNN) Unlike other Oscar weekend events taking place in Los Angeles on Friday, the one thrown by United Talent Agency didn't have a dress code.
The United Voices rally featured celebrity speakers like Jodie Foster, Michael J.
Foster said she doesn't usually feel comfortable using her "public face for activism," but thought the rally was "a great idea."
The organization is offering up blue ribbons to Oscar attendees who wish to show their support for the organization on Sunday.
Zimmer said UTA's decision to hold the rally instead of their party came to him on recent Sunday morning while reviewing his Oscar party invite list.
