At a campaign event in Birmingham, Ala., on Saturday, Nov. 21, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump demands the removal of a well-known activist Mercutio Southall Jr. after he shouts, "Black lives matter!"
“Don’t hurt ’em,” Trump said at a rally in Miami on Oct. 23 as pro-immigration activists were led out.
One of the women, Marissa Janae Johnson, asked the crowd to “join us now in holding Bernie Sanders accountable” for not doing enough to address police brutality.
Caption Members of the Black Lives Matter Seattle chapter took the stage and forced Bernie Sanders to the side at an event in Seattle.
Members of the Seattle chapter of Black Lives Matter took over the microphone just after Sanders began to speak and refused to relinquish it.
