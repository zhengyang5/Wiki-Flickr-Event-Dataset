WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - About three thousand demonstrators marched Saturday near President Donald Trump’s Florida estate to protest his now-blocked executive order temporarily limiting immigration.
The protest began with a rally outside Trump Plaza in West Palm Beach.
They marched two miles to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, where the International Red Cross was holding a fundraiser.
They included a group of about five students from Palm Beach Atlantic University, an evangelical Christian school.
A federal judge in Seattle on Friday temporarily invalidated Trump’s ban on travel to the U.S. from seven primarily Muslim nations.
