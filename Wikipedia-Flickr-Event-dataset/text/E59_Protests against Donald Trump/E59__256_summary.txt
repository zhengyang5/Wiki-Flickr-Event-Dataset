WASHINGTON ― Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez spoke at a White House rally against President Donald Trump’s new travel ban on Monday evening, adding firepower to continuing protests against the president.
Ten days later, he joined a protest against Trump’s first travel ban at the airport in Houston.
Taeb, a Democratic national committeewoman from Virginia who voted for Ellison, invited Perez to the rally.
Trump’s new travel ban, which goes into effect on March 16, is a significant climb-down from the expansive order in late January that embroiled the country’s airports in chaos.
That travel ban was stopped in federal court a few days after it was enacted.
