So it wasn’t surprising that there were protests all around Washington, DC on Inauguration Day, nor even that a minority of protestors used the dissent as an excuse for violence.
Still, the vast majority of protestors, even the ones designed to be disruptive to Trump-supporting inaugural attendees, were peaceful.
Amanda Hopkins, 24, was upset that the protesters were blocking her entrance after she’d traveled all the way from Florida to see Trump sworn in.
“You make Trump look good when you do that,” yelled a man in a Green Party T-shirt at passing protesters.
Those clashes inevitably, overshadowed the more peaceful protests along the parade route and on the Mall, carried out both by groups of activists and individuals of conscience.
