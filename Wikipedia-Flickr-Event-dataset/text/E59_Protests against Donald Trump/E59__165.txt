Eight community activists were briefly taken into police custody Tuesday afternoon at the tail end of an hour-long march through Federal Plaza as part of the weekly "Resist Trump Tuesday" protests.

The activists, clergy members of different faiths and denominations, were taken from the middle of Dearborn Street around 4:30 p.m. and patted down before being loaded into a police wagon. All eight were set to receive citations and be released, according to police. Five men and three women were arrested and issued citations, according to police.

Those activists were brought together by the same coalition of community groups who have run the Resist Trump Tuesdays for the last month. This week, they led a vocal group of about 200 people through downtown streets in response to President Donald Trump's Twitter pledge last month to "Send in the Feds!" if the city cannot control its violent crime.

By bullhorn, speakers said they agreed that the city needed more federal resources to combat crime, but said they don't need the National Guard or outside police action. Their battle cry was "More resources, not more police forces."

They also called on Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans to end Cook County's cash-bail system, saying it unfairly keeps poor and minority non-violent offenders in jail when they are unable to pay. The group marched to the Daley Center, but weren't allowed inside.

The crowd then marched back to Federal Plaza and gathered in the middle of Dearborn Street for several minutes before going back to the sidewalk. The eight who were detained did not leave the street with the others and were taken into custody then.

Resist Trump Tuesdays are nationwide protests organized by groups who have pledged to meet and publicly protest each Tuesday during Trump's first 100 days in office to show their opposition to Trumpâ€™s administration.
