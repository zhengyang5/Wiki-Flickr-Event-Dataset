WASHINGTON -- Soon after Twitter fanatic Donald Trump became president, dozens of accounts purporting to represent federal agencies sprang up to critique his policies.

Many of them -- such as an unauthorized NASA Twitter account that currently has 858,000 followers -- said they were founded out of concern the new administration will stifle scientific research and bury data that disagree with its political views. Those fears were stoked when Trump appointees ordered multiple federal agencies to restrict their public communications.
