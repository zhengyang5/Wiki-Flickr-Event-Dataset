His own account spearheaded his political campaign, but following his inauguration, a number of accounts dedicated to revealing the 'real' Donald Trump have emerged.
@RoguePOTUSStaff, claiming to be 'the unofficial resistance team inside the White House' has quickly gone viral, amassing over 400,000 in just five days and encouraging followers to 'resist'.
Although there is no way to verify the identity of its creator, the tweets allege concerning behavior by the President within the confines of the White House.
The account's most popular tweets address the controversial new immigration ban, which has sparked protests around the world.
However, the image cannot be confirmed and it is unclear if this is the official document of Trump's Executive Order.
