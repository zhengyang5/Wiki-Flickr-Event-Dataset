In recent weeks, the demonstrations have intensified, interrupting Mr. Trump time and again, breaking his train of thought and challenging his ability to command the room.
The rancor is so blatant that Mr. Trump was asked about it during the debate on Thursday night in Miami.
And on Tuesday night, in Jupiter, Fla., the Trump campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, roughly yanked the arm of a Breitbart reporter as she tried to ask Mr. Trump about affirmative action, she and another reporter said.
In Louisville on March 1, Ms. Nwanguma was shocked by the reaction from Trump supporters, she said in an interview later.
But once she begins, she said, Mr. Trump no longer has control over her, or her message.
