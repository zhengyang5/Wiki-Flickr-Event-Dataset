The grassroots team coordinating the March for Science in Washington, D.C., have now set a date: 22 April.
An affiliated “secret” Facebook group attracted almost 800,000 members in less than a week, and more than 70 Twitter handles have popped up to promote sister marches across the country.
Many scientists took the administration’s promotion of “alternative facts” and continued shunning of scientific leaders as signs that science may come under attack.
Some fear a demonstration led by researchers might only serve to paint scientists as an interest group, further politicizing scientific issues.
And at least one veteran science lobbyist has urged organizers to make sure it’s a march for science, not scientists.
