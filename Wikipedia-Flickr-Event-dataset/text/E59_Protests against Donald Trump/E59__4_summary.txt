Denouncing Donald Trump’s presidential bid as a betrayal of American values, demonstrators marched in midtown Manhattan between two towers that bear his name.
“We see Donald Trump as a threat to our brothers and sisters.
Samuel Cohen, a Manhattan lawyer and official observer, said the rally had drawn at least 1,500 to 2,000.
Some activists’ signs said “Veterans Against Trump, “Trump Thinks I’m A Bimbo” and “Deport Trump.” Others depicted him as Hitler and urged people to instead vote for Donald Duck.
One of the very few Trump supporters in evidence was George Overbeck, 45, of Westhampton Beach, who urged the protesters to switch sides.
