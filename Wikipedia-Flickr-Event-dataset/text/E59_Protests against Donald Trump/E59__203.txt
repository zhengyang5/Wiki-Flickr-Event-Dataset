The Trump administration has been hyping up a "Pittsburgh, not Paris" rally currently being held at a park across from the White House — but it looks like Trump isn't in attendance.

According to a pool report, the president's motorcade pulled up at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia on Saturday morning. It's unclear whether the president is playing golf, and the press pool said it would file another report when it gets more information about the president's activities.

While Trump is at his golf club, the "Pittsburgh, not Paris" rally has kicked off with "dozens" of Trump supporters who gathered to express their support for Trump's decision to pull out of the landmark Paris Agreement.

If the US completes the withdrawal process from the climate deal, it will join Nicaragua and Syria — the only other countries who have not signed the agreement.

The rally in support of Trump's decision was organized by the Fairfax County Republican Committee and the Republican Party of Virginia, and it was also touted by the Trump-Pence campaign.

In an email announcing the "Pittsburgh Not Paris Event for President Trump" on Saturday morning, the campaign asked supporters to "dress in your most patriotic, red, white, and blue outfit." It also also took shots at the media for keeping Trump "under siege."

Editor's note: An earlier version of this article stated that Trump was at a golf club in Bedminster, NJ. It has been updated to reflect that Trump is at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, VA.
