WASHINGTON -- On the eve of President-elect Trump’s inauguration, protesters flooded Pennsylvania Avenue near the locations of inaugural balls and events, reports CBS Washington affiliate WUSA-TV.
The station says police used pepper spray on the protesters several times.
Demonstrators clogged the area outside the National Press Club, where the “DeploraBall” was being held, with prominent members of the group Alt-Right attending.
Police came out with pepper spray, WUSA reports, adding there were at least four fights between protesters and ball guests.
Demonstrators outside the press club shouted “Donald Trump your hands are small, you’ll never build your border wall.” WUSA says it was the group’s protest anthem.
