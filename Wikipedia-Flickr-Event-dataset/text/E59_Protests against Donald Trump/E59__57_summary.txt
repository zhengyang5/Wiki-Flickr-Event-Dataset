Hand-scrawled signs declared "Not My President," "No To Bigotry," "Trump Puts My Life In Danger," and "Protests Are Patriotic."
And yet in recent years – in particular since the 2008 financial crisis – Americans have been rediscovering the power of protest.
As one popular sign from the anti-Trump protests read, "Not Usually A Sign Guy, But Geez."
The anti-Trump protesters have offered up many different reasons for joining the rallies, vigils, marches and walk-outs.
The protests also pressure elected officials on both sides of the aisle to stand up to Trump.
