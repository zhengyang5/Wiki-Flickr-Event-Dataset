Badlands National Park sent out a series of (now-deleted) tweets on climate change, seemingly in defiance of Trump administrationIf you had “National Parks subtweet the new president” on your 2017 bingo card, today’s your lucky day.
After the US National Parks Service was temporarily banned for retweeting images comparing Trump and Obama’s inaugurations, the official Twitter account of the appropriately named Badlands National Park, based in South Dakota, appeared to go rogue by posting a series of now-deleted tweets on climate change.
The most popular is @AltNatParkSer, which bills itself as the unofficial “resistance” team of the US National Parks Service.

A National Parks official told BuzzFeed the climate change tweets were posted by a “former employee” who was not authorised to use the account.
