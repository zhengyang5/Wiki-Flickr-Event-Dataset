REUTERS/David MoirThe Trump administration has been hyping up a "Pittsburgh, not Paris" rally currently being held at a park across from the White House â€” but it looks like Trump isn't in attendance.
According to a pool report, the president's motorcade pulled up at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia on Saturday morning.
While Trump is at his golf club, the "Pittsburgh, not Paris" rally has kicked off with "dozens" of Trump supporters who gathered to express their support for Trump's decision to pull out of the landmark Paris Agreement.
Editor's note: An earlier version of this article stated that Trump was at a golf club in Bedminster, NJ.
It has been updated to reflect that Trump is at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, VA.
