May Day protests spark brawls, arrests across countryThousands of labor and immigrant right activists took to the streets Monday for a wave of protests in conjunction with May Day, a day that sparks protests annually among progressives but which took on a sharper edge this year over concerns about President Donald Trump's agenda.
Across the country, groups urged immigrant workers to skip work, school and shopping to demonstrate their impact on the economy.
And they come as tensions are rising between far-left and far-right activists.
Far-left and far-right groups have clashed there in recent weeks over planned speeches by conservative provocateurs.
May Day has roots as a spring festival in European pagan cultures, but it was dubbed International Workers' Day by socialist, anarchist and communist groups.
