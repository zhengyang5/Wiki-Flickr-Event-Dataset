Most of the 230 protesters arrested during Donald Trump’s inauguration on Friday will face charges of felony rioting, a crime which carries a maximum sentence of a decade in prison in Washington DC.
The 217 alleged rioters – who could also be hit with $250,000 (£200,000) fines – appeared before Washington’s Superior Court throughout Sunday.

The protesters, many of whom came to Washington in association with the umbrella protest group DisruptJ20, were kettled by riot police before a number were arrested.
As the defendants left the police station, they were greeted by a smaller crowd of supporters chanting “anti-capitalista”.
