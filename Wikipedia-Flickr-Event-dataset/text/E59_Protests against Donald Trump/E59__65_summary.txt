Donald Trump has sparked countless protests in record time across the country, the world and space.
Yes, you read that correctly.
A small space network launched what it’s calling the “first protest in space” against President Trump on Wednesday.
The team at the Autonomous Space Agency Network (ASAN) printed an enormous tweet from their own Twitter account, Motherboard reported.
All ASAN missions presuppose a will to creative independence in space.”Although there’s a good chance Trump saw this and scratched his head, most can understand why a group of space explorers would target the president for space’s first and only protest.
