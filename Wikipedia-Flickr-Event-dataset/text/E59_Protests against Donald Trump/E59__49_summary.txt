Nationwide protests gripped many cities for days following the presidential election as thousands march against Donald Trump's victory.
Elsewhere, thousands of protesters surrounded Trump's buildings in New York and Chicago, clashing with supporters of the president-elect in some areas.
The protests earned recriminations from Trump, who met with President Obama at the White House Thursday morning.
Before that, protesters had marched from Union Square to Trump's building, chanting, “Donald Trump, go away!
Later, amid a cacophony of loud chants, a glowing “Love Trumps Hate” banner was held aloft under the Trump Tower sign.
