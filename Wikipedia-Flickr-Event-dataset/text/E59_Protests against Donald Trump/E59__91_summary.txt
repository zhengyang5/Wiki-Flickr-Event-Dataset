Multiple Twitter accounts claiming to be run by members of the National Park Service and other U.S. agencies have appeared since the Trump administration's apparent gag order.
"Rogue" accounts that have the look of those by real federal agencies are spreading like wildfire on Twitter.
The AltUSNatParkService Twitter account has gained more than 1 million followers and inspired the creation of many more "unofficial resistance" accounts for specific national parks and other entities, including accounts like Rogue NASA and AltUSForestService.
Accounts like @ungaggedEPA and Stuff EPA Would Say list similar missions: to "flood the Web with real climate facts" and say things the EPA "is unable to tell you."
He says he sees the creation of these accounts and dissemination of the facts on climate change as being in the public interest.
