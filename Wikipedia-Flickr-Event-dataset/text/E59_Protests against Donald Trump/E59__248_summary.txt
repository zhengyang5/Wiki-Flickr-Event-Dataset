Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) is a frequent critic of Donald Trump.
But on Tuesday, he offered a rebuke of the president that was strong even for him.
This is not my President,” Schatz tweeted, in reaction to a press conference in which Trump once again blamed “both sides” for the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.
During a press conference in New York on Tuesday, Trump seemed to walk back the previous day’s condemnation of white nationalist groups, including neo-Nazis and the KKK.
also reacted to the president’s press conference on Twitter, calling his words “sick.”
