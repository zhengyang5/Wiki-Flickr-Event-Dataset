City councillor Kshama Sawant of the Socialist Alternative, a Trotskyist party, became the first socialist in 97 years to win a citywide election in Seattle and entered office in January 2014.
Sawant spoke to Al Jazeera about protests, immigrants' rights and what to expect from Trump's policies.
Kshama Sawant: It's absolutely correct that socialist organisations have experienced a historic surge in the last several months.
Al Jazeera: Has Trump's flurry of executive orders deregulating Wall Street and targeting immigrants created a feeling of urgency?
Sawant: I think there is no question that this is a historic opportunity that we would ignore at our own peril on the US left.
