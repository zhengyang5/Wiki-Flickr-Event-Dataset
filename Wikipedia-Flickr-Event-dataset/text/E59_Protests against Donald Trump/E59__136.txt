Story highlights A CNN analysis of police estimates suggests more than a million people took part in marches not including the core Women's March on Washington

(CNN) More than a million Americans took to the streets of the United States to protest Donald Trump the day after his inauguration. And that doesn't include the many thousands of people who took part in the main event -- The Women's March on Washington -- for which there was no official crowd estimate.
