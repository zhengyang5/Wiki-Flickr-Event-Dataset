While the clashes occurred, thousands of peaceful protesters marched across the country as they voiced anti-Trump slogans.
Protesters hurled rocks and bricks at police officers several blocks from the parade route.
Officers with helmets and riot shields tried to disperse the protesters by using flash grenades and pepper spray.
The police, using more flash grenades, cleared a path for fire trucks as protesters retreated to a park.
The violence attracted a throng of onlookers, journalists and peaceful protesters who had marched earlier in the day.
