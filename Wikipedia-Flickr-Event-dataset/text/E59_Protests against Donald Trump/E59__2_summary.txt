Donald Trump and his entourage were not prepared for the 2,000 protesters who greeted them with chants of “Dump Trump!” as they arrived for the California Republican Convention in Burlingame.
The militant show of force by community members and activists, led largely by youth and students, forced Trump’s security apparatus to hop over a barricade and escort the racist candidate through a back entrance.
“Donald Trump Forced to Jump Over Wall,” read the headlines of the NBC Bay Area’s website.
Several residents from the Bay Area and beyond came out to shut down Trump without prior knowledge of the planned actions, and Unite HERE!
At the end, protestors chanted and cheered in celebration knowing that our message of resistance reverberated through the mass media and social networks.
