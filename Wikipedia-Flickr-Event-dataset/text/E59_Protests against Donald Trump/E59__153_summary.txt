Image caption The protest in Edinburgh was organised by the Scotland Against Trump groupA "national demonstration" against the policies of US President Donald Trump has taken place in Edinburgh.
The event was organised by the Scotland Against Trump group.
It was also behind similar protests held last month when thousands took to the streets in Scottish cities after Mr Trump announced a crackdown on immigration.
More than 1.8m people across the UK have signed a petition urging the UK government to withdraw the offer of a state visit to Mr Trump.
That, and a counter-petition insisting Mr Trump should be allowed to visit, which gathered more than 300,000 signatures, will be debated at Westminster on 20 February.
