MEXICO CITY — Wide-spread anti-Donald Trump demonstrations were held in 18 cities across Mexico on Sunday, marking the country’s first such protests since the U.S. president’s inauguration less than a month ago.
The principle behind them was simple: a show of national unity against Donald Trump.
Protest organizer Maria Elena Morera, said the event, which also took place in Monterrey, Puebla and Tijuana, was not aimed at Americans generally but at Trump’s policies.

Perhaps surprisingly, Mexicans hadn’t taken to the streets en masse to protest Trump before today, even after being the focus of Trump’s critical policies and rhetoric, especially the building of a border wall and an executive order on immigration.
