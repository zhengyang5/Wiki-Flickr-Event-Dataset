The Day Without a Woman strike is now set for March 8th, International Women’s Day.
Organizers for last month’s Women’s March on Washington set the date for women across supportive communities to collectively stop working that day to protest White House policies and legislation.
Women’s March announced plans for a general strike last month in the wake of the mass protests that followed President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The announcement for the strike comes via Instagram, calling for communities to “unite” for gender equity and against oppression:The weeks since Donald Trump took office have seen numerous protests, including the global Women’s March as well as protests and public outcry against the recent immigration ban.
Organizers are also calling for a general strike this Friday in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York City.
