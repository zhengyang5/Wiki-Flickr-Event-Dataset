Mr. Trump employs several other security guards, some of whom, in recent weeks, have been seen moving in plain clothes into crowds to try to end disruptions.
According to campaign finance filings, Mr. Trump has spent about $170,000 on “security services” throughout his campaign.

Arrest her.”While Mr. Trump complains that protesters are violating his First Amendment rights, many of his critics wonder about their own ability to speak out.
