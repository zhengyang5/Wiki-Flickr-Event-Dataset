Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!
â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017ADVERTISEMENTCongressional Democrats rallied Monday evening outside of the Supreme Court with thousands of supporters to urge Trump to rescind his executive order, which temporarily bans citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.
Waving signs, some held by young children propped on parents' shoulders, they chanted and sang throughout the event, hammering Trump's executive order as antithetical to American values and warning that they won't soon be silenced.
The order also includes a 120-day ban on admitting refugees and an indefinite halt on admitting refugees from war-torn Syria.
