Thousands march in SF for Trump’s impeachmentThousands of people sporting patriotic costumes and toting hand-penned signs took a peaceful stroll in San Francisco under bright, clear skies Sunday afternoon to call for the impeachment of President Trump.
Nearly everyone carried a sign, many calling for impeachment and several insisting that Trump release his tax returns.
The mood was defiant but festive, and after reaching Battery Street, the throng turned around and headed back to Justin Herman Plaza.
