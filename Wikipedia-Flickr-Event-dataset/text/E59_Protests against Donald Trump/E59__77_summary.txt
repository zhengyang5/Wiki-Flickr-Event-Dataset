As protestors organize ‘Not my President’s Day’ rallies against President Trump in cities across the country, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke discusses how law enforcement is planning to deal with the protests.
Clarke then took issue with the anti-Trump protestors’ behavior.
“They’re trying to intimidate him into inaction, they’re trying to deny him his lawful position as President of the United States.
“That report - under that cop-hating DOJ, led by Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and President Obama - that report was junk, it was garbage, it was full of lies.
None of that stuff in that report, and I saw it, none of it is true.”
