Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Scotland's capital in protest against the politics and policies of US president Donald Trump.

Protesters chanted "stop deportation" at the Edinburgh demo with placards saying "no to racism, no to Trump" and "time to dingy Donald".

The colourful march organised by Scotland Against Trump travelled from the Meadows before passing the Royal Mile and continuing over the North Bridge.

It was expected to continue along Regent Terrace past the US Consulate but police stopped marchers from passing the building and protesters continued their march to the Scottish Parliament where they held a rally.

Organisers said people had been brought in by bus from other cities in Scotland.

The event included speeches by human rights groups, trade union representatives and anti-racism campaigners.

After arriving at the Scottish Parliament, a series of speakers spoke against the US president.

Scotland Against Trump said it was time to fight back against Trump's policies.

In a statement it said: "Trump is the apex of an insurgency of an international far-right.

"We will resist. We are the majority. We are ready to make our voice heard."

A police spokesman said: "Police Scotland supported the safe facilitation of the demonstration in Edinburgh on Saturday, February 11, which passed peacefully and without incident.

"Officers would also like to thank the public for their patience and cooperation during this time."
