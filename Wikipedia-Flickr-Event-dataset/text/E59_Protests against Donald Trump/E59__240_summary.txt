More than 20 US states have proposed bills placing new restrictions on protests in the months since Donald Trump became President.
The potential laws included legislation creating stricter penalties for protesters who are arrested, and in some states, removing liability from drivers who accidentally injure protesters on the roads.
In Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Tennessee and Florida there are proposed bills to toughen penalties for blocking roads or trespassing.
The election of Mr Trump in January triggered a spate of mass protests.
Hundreds of thousands of Americans joined the women's marches and a number of anti-Trump marches have taken place since.
