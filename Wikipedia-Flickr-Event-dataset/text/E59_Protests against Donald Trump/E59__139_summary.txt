— TMC editorsThe Women’s March on Washington was likely the largest single-day demonstration in recorded U.S. history.
We started a spreadsheet and called for crowdsourced information about the location and number of participants in marches.
From this, we counted at least 653 reported marches in the United States.
In total, the women’s march involved between 3,267,134 and 5,246,670 people in the United States (our best guess is 4,157,894).
As others have argued here recently, U.S. conditions are ripe for more women’s — and other — protests in the coming months and years.
