Operating 24 hours a day beginning on Inauguration Day, “Hewillnotdivide.Us”—created by LaBeouf, Ronkko & Turner, the team behind 2015’s #Allmymovies—was established in response to Donald Trump’s election.
It was mounted on a wall outside of the museum in Astoria, Queens, offering passers-by the opportunity to say “He will not divide us” into a live-streamed webcam.
In unfortunate contradiction with its messaging, the installation became a political battleground, as clashes between Trump supporters and opponents turned violent—an ugly distillation of what’s currently playing out on a much larger scale around the country.
LaBeouf himself was arrested days later at the site, on suspicion of misdemeanor assault and harassment, while neighbors complained about increased instances of loitering, according to Page Six.
