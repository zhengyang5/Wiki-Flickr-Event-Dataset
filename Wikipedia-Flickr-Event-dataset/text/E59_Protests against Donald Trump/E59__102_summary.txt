And now a group of White House staffers has gone rogue in resistance with a new Twitter account.
In a statement on its new website, managers of the Rogue POTUS Staff Twitter credit the various government agencies whose employees created alternative Twitter accounts to resist Trump.
The Rogue POTUS Twitter account is well worth following for the intimate nature of its tweets.
Another tweet the Rogue POTUS Staff account released has the new president being admonished for not wanting to attend intelligence briefings.
Just as the Rogue POTUS Staff Twitter account points out internal fighting among senior staff, so does the New York Times.
