The demonstrators ripped up their white bonnets, with one calling Trump a "sexist" and a man who "really endangers our Earth."

Warsaw, Poland, is the latest city to be inhabited by people dressed up as characters from The Handmaid's Tale, this time protesting President Trump's visit and speech in Poland.

The activists donned red capes and white bonnets, referred to as "wings" in Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel turned Hulu series about the stripping of women's rights. A video on Twitter captioned "We will never become handmaids! We won't allow it!" showed protestors standing with signs that read "Dumb Trump," as well as rainbow flags and flags designed to combat racism. The protestors ripped up their white bonnets in unison.

"The current president of the United States is not only a sexist and a misogynist who often brags about molesting women but also someone who really endangers our Earth," said one protestor who was interviewed on the scene. She went on to talk about Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement.

Prior to the event, protest organizers held a gathering to sew capes and create the bonnets, putting instructions on how to make the wings on Facebook.

The Trump handmaid protest in Poland is the latest in a string of protests in which activists wear costumes from the television series. Previous protests across the United States have featured women dressing up to protest local and national legislation involving health care, abortion and women's access to contraception.
