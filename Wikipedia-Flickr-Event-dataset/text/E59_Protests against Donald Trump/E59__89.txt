As we reported earlier this week, several government agencies (USDA, EPA, HHS, and Department of the Interior) have been ordered by the Trump administration to stop communicating with the public for the time being.

Twitter, specifically, has been a source of contention. It all started when the official National Park Service account was asked to stop tweeting after it shared photos that compared the crowd size of Trump’s inauguration to the crowd size of Obama’s inauguration in 2009. Then the official Badlands National Park Twitter went rogue and started tweeting facts about climate change. The tweets were later removed and blamed on “a former employee who was not authorized to use the park’s account.”

Since those tweets were removed, over 40 “alt” or “rogue” Twitter accounts have sprouted up to fill in for many agencies and National Parks. Some of them already have a pretty big following—currently, AltUSNatParkService has more than 1.27 million followers. So far we’re seeing climate facts, inspirational quotes about the environment, cute photos of animals, and a lot of snark (this is Twitter, after all).

So for those of you who still want to see info about climate change and the environment during this supposedly temporary crackdown, we’ve created a list of some of these accounts, especially the ones that pertain to food and agriculture. And of course, the necessary caveat: We’re not entirely sure who is running these accounts (though in the case of @AltNatParkSer, they tweeted on January 27 that “Several of us are environmental activists and two are journalists [our FACT checkers]. All of us are former scientists.)”, so we caution you to, as always, think critically about what you’re reading. If we’re missing any, feel free to let us know and we’ll update this list.

Resisting the censorship of facts and science. Truth wins in the end.
