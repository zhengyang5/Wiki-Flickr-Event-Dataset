A "national demonstration" against the policies of US President Donald Trump has taken place in Edinburgh.

Protestors gathered at the Meadows before marching to the US consulate and the Scottish Parliament.

The event was organised by the Scotland Against Trump group.

It was also behind similar protests held last month when thousands took to the streets in Scottish cities after Mr Trump announced a crackdown on immigration.

Buses were organised to bring in groups from other parts of Scotland.

'We will resist'

The event included speeches by human rights groups, abortion rights campaigners, trade union representatives and lawyer and anti-racism campaigner Aamer Anwar.

The protestors called on President Trump's proposed state visit to the UK to be cancelled, and for an end to the so-called special relationship between Britain and the US.

A statement from Scotland Against Trump said it was "time to fight back".

It added: "We will stand up and be counted. Trump is the apex of an insurgency of an international far-right. We will resist. We are the majority. We are ready to make our voice heard."

Since January's protests, most of the provisions of Mr Trump's travel ban, which targets seven mainly Muslim countries, have been suspended amid legal challenges.

The president insists America's national security is at risk and has indicated he intends to pursue further legal avenues.

More than 1.8m people across the UK have signed a petition urging the UK government to withdraw the offer of a state visit to Mr Trump.

That, and a counter-petition insisting Mr Trump should be allowed to visit, which gathered more than 300,000 signatures, will be debated at Westminster on 20 February.

The UK government has already rejected calls to cancel the visit.
