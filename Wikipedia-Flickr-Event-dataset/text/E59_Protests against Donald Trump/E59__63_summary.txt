Protesters in cities across the country took to the streets on Monday for “Not My President’s Day” rallies with a strong anti-Trump message.
In New York’s Columbus Circle, protesters held signs with a simple message — the word “No!” in different languages.
The rallies on Monday came amid what has been a fierce backlash from liberal grassroots groups to the Trump administration.
That opposition has been voiced on a broad range of issues, including women’s reproductive rights, immigration, and climate change.
New Jersey resident Janell Kastner joined the New York rally to protest the “gross incompetence” of President Trump, she said.
