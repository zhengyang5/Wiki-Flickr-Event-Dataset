Washington (CNN) Washington, DC, restaurants and schools were prepared for a "Day Without Immigrants" protest Thursday, but so far, policymakers who live in the nation's capital haven't taken much notice.
Immigrants and supporters were planning to strike Thursday in a protest loosely organized by social media and word of mouth.
Restaurants in the DC area were planning to operate with short staff, offer menus in solidarity with striking immigrants and in some cases, close altogether.
A bilingual charter school in Northwest DC planned to close, and DC public schools were preparing for possible walkouts.
Sweetgreen, a chain of salad restaurants, said it would close all of its DC locations in solidarity with its team members and Day Without Immigrants.
