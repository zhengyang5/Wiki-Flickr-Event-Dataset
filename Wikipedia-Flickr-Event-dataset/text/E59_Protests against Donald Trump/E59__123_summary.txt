A YOUNG boy named Connor has become the (baby) face of the protests at Donald Trump’s inauguration in Washington DC.
Hours after the ceremony, demonstrations are still in full swing, with thousands gathering to rally against Donald Trump’s policies.
Anti-Trump protesters smashed in windows of a Starbucks next to Hamilton Hotel, a McDonald’s, a Bank of America branch and a bus stop.
Crowd members yelled, “F*** NBC”, F*** mainstream media”, at another journalist, tweeted BuzzFeed reporter Zoe Tillman.
They smashed this window,” adding cops were “tear-gassing them.”“[Cops] had the protesters up against a building,” her husband added.
