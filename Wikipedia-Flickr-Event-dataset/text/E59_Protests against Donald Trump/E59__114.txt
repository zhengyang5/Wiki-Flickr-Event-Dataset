Violent protests erupted in downtown Washington on Friday, with a limousine set on fire just half a mile from Donald Trump's victory parade and protesters lobbing rocks into lines of police.

Smoke filled the streets as the limousine burnt, with police filling the area and firing tear gas at protesters.

There were more than 217 arrests over the course of the afternoon, six police officers suffered minor injuries and the area remained tense into the evening.
