MIAMI (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters took their frustrations over Donald Trump’s election as the next U.S. president onto the streets on Friday and into Saturday in several cities, including Portland, Oregon, where one protester was shot.
Earlier in the night, protesters blocked traffic and threw objects at Portland police dressed in riot gear who responded with pepper spray and flash-bang devices.
At one point, police pushed protesters back and appeared to take at least one person into custody, according to footage on a local NBC affiliate.
“Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country.
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus acknowledged on Friday the tight race with Clinton, but said anti-Trump protesters have to accept the election results.
