(CNN) Another week, another series of demonstrations by opponents of President Donald Trump.
Protesters in cities across the country took to the streets on Monday for "Not My President's Day" rallies with a strong anti-Trump message.
The rallies on Monday came amid what has been a fierce backlash from liberal grassroots groups to the Trump administration.
New Jersey resident Janell Kastner joined the New York rally to protest the "gross incompetence" of President Trump, she said.
"What is unusual is the vigor, speed, size, and number of issues that they're challenging Trump on," Meyer said.
