Eight community activists were briefly taken into police custody Tuesday afternoon at the tail end of an hour-long march through Federal Plaza as part of the weekly "Resist Trump Tuesday" protests.
Those activists were brought together by the same coalition of community groups who have run the Resist Trump Tuesdays for the last month.
By bullhorn, speakers said they agreed that the city needed more federal resources to combat crime, but said they don't need the National Guard or outside police action.
The crowd then marched back to Federal Plaza and gathered in the middle of Dearborn Street for several minutes before going back to the sidewalk.
Resist Trump Tuesdays are nationwide protests organized by groups who have pledged to meet and publicly protest each Tuesday during Trump's first 100 days in office to show their opposition to Trumpâ€™s administration.
