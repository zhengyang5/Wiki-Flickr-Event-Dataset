Friday night’s deadly shooting in Santa Barbara that left seven dead, including the shooter, has renewed calls for gun-control by some as a means to put a stop to senseless mass-killings.
Richard Martinez, the father of a 20-year-old University of California, Santa Barbara student who was shot to death during the rampage, placed blame for his son’s death on the National Rifle Association and pro-gun politicians.

Calling him “severely mentally disturbed,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said the 22-year-old stabbed to death three individuals at his residence “prior to [the] shooting rampage” that took place near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus Friday night.
