Rodger stabbed to death three roommates at his apartment late Friday night before starting his shooting spree, said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown.
The stabbing victims, all UC Santa Barbara students, were: Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, George Chen, 19, and Weihan Wang, 20, according to the sheriff's office.
Rodger told officers he had problems in his social life.
Rodger wrote that Alpha Phi Sorority had the most beautiful girls but that the members were "spoiled, heartless, wicked" women who would likely reject him.
