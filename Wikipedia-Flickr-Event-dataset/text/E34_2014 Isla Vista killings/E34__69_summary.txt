It was 30 seconds into the The Video—that is, the widely disseminated, six-minute-long “Retribution” video shot by mass murderer Elliot Rodger in the front seat of his BMW—that Morning Joe cohost Mika Brzezinski had seen enough.
“It’s pretty simple,” Brzezinski told me afterward, explaining their decision to cut it short, earlier than planned.
On Saturday, YouTube removed Rodger’s ‘Retribution’ video, and today all his other YouTube videos have been removed from the site.
On television, Brzezinski and others are attempting to be more sensitive to the implications of easy sensationalism.
At Tuesday morning’s regular editorial meeting, ABC News President James Goldston told his troops that the “Retribution Video” will be used with restraint.
