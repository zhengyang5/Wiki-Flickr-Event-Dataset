The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department has identified the stabbing victims found in Elliot Rodger’s apartment Friday night.
Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley said Sunday that Hong was the roommate at the center of a citizen complaint filed by Rodger in mid-January.
Hong pleaded guilty to petty theft after Rodger filed the complaint claiming that Hong had stolen three candles valued at $22.
They were found with multiple stab wounds in Rodger’s apartment located in the 6500 block of Seville Road in Isla Vista.
Sheriff’s investigators believe Rodger killed these victims prior to going on a shooting rampage in Isla Vista Friday night.
