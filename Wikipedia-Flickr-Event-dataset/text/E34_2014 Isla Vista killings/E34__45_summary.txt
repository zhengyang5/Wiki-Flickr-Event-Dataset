The parents of Elliot Rodger had been desperately trying to stop their son carrying out his killing spree when they heard about the massacre in Isla Vista, California, on the radio, it emerged on Sunday.
Family friend Simon Astaire told Reuters that Rodger's mother, Chin Rodger, received a phone call on the night of the shooting from his therapist alerting her to the manifesto.
She called police and her ex-husband and the two parents raced to Isla Vista, he said.
But it was too late â€“ Ms Rodger heard radio reports about the shootings as she drove and police in Santa Barbara told the pair their son was believed to be the gunman.
She said Rodger had talked to her son about wanting to hold down and rape women.
