Elliot Rodger had pondered mass murder for years before last month’s killing spree near Santa Barbara, which left seven dead and another 13 wounded.
Rodger climbed onto a 10-foot ledge where he pretended to pick off party goers with an imaginary gun.
In his 141-page manifesto, Rodger recalled the outing as a “last ditch effort” to lose his virginity before turning 22.
The following day, two sheriff’s deputies visited Rodger in Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, where he was being treated for his broken ankle, and questioned him about the previous night’s altercations.
“During my contact with Rodger he appeared to not be forth coming with me,” officer M. West wrote in his report.
