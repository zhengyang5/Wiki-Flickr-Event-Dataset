Three victims in Santa Barbara rampage from Bay AreaThree of the victims killed in a deadly rampage Friday near Santa Barbara are from the Bay Area, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office said Sunday.
All three victims were UC Santa Barbara students.
Authorities said Hong and Chen, along with Rodger, were on the lease as tenants of the apartment on the 6500 block of Seville Road in Isla Vista.
Investigators believe Rodger killed the three victims before then going on a shooting rampage around Isla Vista that left four more dead, including the gunman.
Deputies found three semi-automatic handguns along with 400 unspent rounds in his black BMW after the shooting rampage was over.
