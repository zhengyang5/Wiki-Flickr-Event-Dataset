A new Tumblr, When Women Refuse, listed story after story of women who suffered violence after rejecting a man's sexual advances.
And the Twitter hashtag #YesAllWomen went viral as hundreds of thousands of people shared their experiences with misogyny.
For instance, writer and sex educator Kendall Mckenzie tweeted, "When women trust men, we're naive idiots who should've known better.
But those men were as much victims of Rodger's misogyny as the women he hurt and killed â€“ women aren't the only ones hurt by hateful ideology.
And that when said shooter explains that his motivations is as simple as a profound hatred for women, that we believe him.
