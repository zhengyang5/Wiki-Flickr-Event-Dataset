(Reuters) - The families of three victims slain during a southern California rampage last year that left dead six college students and the killer are suing the county, the sheriff’s department and the apartment building where the victims were killed.
Students light candles at a tribute for victims, at one of nine crime scenes after a series of drive-by shootings that left 7 people dead, in the Isla Vista neighborhood of Santa Barbara, California May 26, 2014.
Capri also didn’t warn the new housemates of his past actions, the suit said.
The complaint said the lack of further investigation was a violation of the victims’ constitutional right to due process under the law.
A report by the sheriff’s office published last month showed that Rodger had an interest in Nazis, particularly the party officials Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler, and did web searches for torture devices.
