The release of the report marks the end of the investigation into the events of last Spring’s mass shooting.
Sullivan and other individuals ran to SB County Sheriff’s Deputy Patrick Genovese at Freebirds, and the deputies and civilians then ran to the females suffering gunshot wounds.
Genovese proceeded to apply direct pressure to DeKock’s gunshot wounds, and an unidentified civilian began performing CPR on Cooper.
“Despite the move to Isla Vista, the suspect continued to have difficulty interacting with his peers,” the report states.
“While living in Isla Vista, the suspect received services from three social counselors through a Santa Barbara-based agency,” the report states.
