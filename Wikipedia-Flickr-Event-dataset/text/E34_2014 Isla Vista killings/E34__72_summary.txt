Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters Saturday evening that the suspect was wounded by officers before he seemingly "took his own life."
The shootings took place in nine locations in the town of Isla Vista near the UCSB campus at about 9.30 p.m. local time Friday.
The lawyer also said the suspect was being treated by multiple therapists and was a student at Santa Barbara City College.
Jason Lomelino, pastor of Isla Vista Church, says his congregation is ready to assist anyone in need of prayer in the aftermath of the shootings.
"Isla Vista Church expresses its deep sorrow over the events that occurred last night," Lomelino told Noozhawk.com.
