SANTA BARBARA >> More than a thousand students and community members gathered Saturday evening for a somber remembrance of friends and classmates killed in the rampage near UC Santa Barbara on Friday night.

Holding candles the group assembled at the center of campus for a rendition of “Amazing Grace” by the school’s Acapella group, before marching a mile or so through town to a park.

Along the way. some students stopped to mourn at I.V. Delimart. A small monument of flowers stands outside the store where a young man was shot Friday evening.

Chancellor Henry Yang said he was moved by the compassion of first responders, students and community members.

“We know there are many more difficult days ahead of us,” Yang said. “We will continued to draw strength and support from each other.”

Students, who knew victims of last night’s slayings, also addressed the crowd.

“I just want to say, Chris, wherever you are, I love you,” said one student, stopping to compose himself at times.
