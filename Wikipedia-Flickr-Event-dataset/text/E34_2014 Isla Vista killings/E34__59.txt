The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department has identified the stabbing victims found in Elliot Rodger’s apartment Friday night. Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose, California is among the dead. Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley said Sunday that Hong was the roommate at the center of a citizen complaint filed by Rodger in mid-January. Hong pleaded guilty to petty theft after Rodger filed the complaint claiming that Hong had stolen three candles valued at $22.

The infraction, Dudley said, would have been a fine.

All three victims were UCSB students. They were found with multiple stab wounds in Rodger’s apartment located in the 6500 block of Seville Road in Isla Vista. Hong was listed on the lease for the apartment as a tenant, along with Rodger.

Sheriff’s investigators believe Rodger killed these victims prior to going on a shooting rampage in Isla Vista Friday night. In all, six people were killed and 13 others were wounded. Rodger died in the incident, possibly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said.
