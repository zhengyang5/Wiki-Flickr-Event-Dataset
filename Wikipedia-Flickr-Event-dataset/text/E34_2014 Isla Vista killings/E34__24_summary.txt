Brown said Rodger then drove toward the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive and brandished a handgun at a female victim standing at the corner of the street.
As she was walking down the street, coming from Del Playa, Swartz was approached by the suspectâ€™s vehicle and shot at.
Rodger continued driving, fired multiple times and then shot another victim at the intersection of Camino Pescadero and Sabado Tarde.
After deputies shot back at Rodger, wounding him in the left hip area, he drove down El Embarcadero, shooting a bicyclist before heading toward Del Playa again.
Rodger continued toward Del Playa Drive and again turned right onto the street, driving down the 6500 block in the opposite direction of campus.
