Itâ€™s time to call misogynist extremism by its name.
Misogynist extremism is no different.
For some time now misogynist extremism has been excused, as all acts of terrorism committed by white men are excused, as an aberration, as the work of random loons, not real men at all.
Why can we not speak about misogynist extremism - why can we not speak about misogyny at all - even when the language used by Elliot Rodger is everywhere online?
Misogynist extremism does not exist in a mystical digital fairyland where there are no consequences.
