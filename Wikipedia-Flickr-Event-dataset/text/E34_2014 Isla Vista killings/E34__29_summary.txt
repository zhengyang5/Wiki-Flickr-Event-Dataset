I didn’t know if it was blood or not and it didn’t hurt yet so I rolled up on to the sidewalk, laid my bike down, and then my leg started hurting.
I’m really thankful for that.
I didn’t know who got shot, I didn’t know where it all happened, I just knew there was a crash on my street.
I’ve gotten that before, I’ve had my own guy friends yell at me because I won’t dance with them.
I hate when people just say “It’s not gonna stop it.” I know I’m not gonna stop it!
