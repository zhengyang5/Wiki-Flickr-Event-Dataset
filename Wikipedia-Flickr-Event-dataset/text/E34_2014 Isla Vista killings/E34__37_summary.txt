One of three roommates slain in Friday's blood-thirsty killing spree wanted to move out of the apartment shared with accused Santa Barbara killer Elliot Rodger, his devastated parents have revealed.
Wang, pictured, was one of three young men allegedly stabbed to death by Elliot Rodger during a murder spree through Isla Vista, Calif., on Friday night.
His parents said Wang didn't interact much with Rodger.
(NBC)Liu said her son rarely interacted with Rodger, blaming a lack of interest between them and Rodger not being very social.
The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office described Chen and Hong as both listed on the apartment's lease as tenants with Rodger.
