The man inside – Elliot Rodger – had a “smirky, grimacy smile” across his face, de Kock said.
“And then I realized I’m bleeding, I’m in pain,” she said.
Weiss and Cooper represent two of the six people Rodger killed in the rampage, with de Kock and 12 others injured.
Police visited Rodger on a welfare check April 30.
That welfare check included four Sheriff’s deputies and a police officer, along with a dispatcher-in-training – a bigger presence than the two deputies who normally respond on a welfare check.
