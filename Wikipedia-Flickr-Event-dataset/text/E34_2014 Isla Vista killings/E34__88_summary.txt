This time, however, the men’s rights and pick-up artist communities are getting more attention, and not just from feminist blogs.
Sunday night, Gawker’s Jordan Sargeant noticed that Rap Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam posted incendiary annotations to Rodger’s 141-page manifesto.
The manifesto had been uploaded to News Genius, Rap Genius’s sister site which aims to annotate and explain the news.
All of which is contrary to everything we’re trying to accomplish at Rap Genius.
Were Mahbod’s annotations posted by a Rap Genius moderator, that person would cease to be an effective community leader and would have to step down.
