UCSB Graduation CeremonySANTA BARBARA, Calif. - About six thousand students are graduating in eight official commencement ceremonies held on the UCSB campus over eight days.
Before the commencement speeches and diplomas were handed out, graduates paused to remember their fellow students killed in the Isla Vista tragedy.
UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang said, "Let's take a moment of silence to remember George, Katie, James, Chris, David and Veronica."
The silence erupted into cheers after Yang announced the victims would receive diplomas too.
Four of the victims were students in The College of Science and Engineering.
