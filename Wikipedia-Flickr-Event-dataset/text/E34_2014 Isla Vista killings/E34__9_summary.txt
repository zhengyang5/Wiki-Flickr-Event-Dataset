Residents recalled that Elliot Rodger was an unusual character, never had friends over, became infuriated when he passed couples in the courtyard, and spent quite a bit of time alone sitting in his parked car.
In some cases, property managers place residents together based on a personality questionnaire, a procedure also used for university housing.
It appeared Rodger appeared to be searching for attention, but the residents who tried to befriend him had no success.
Rodger was parked in a space directly outside of his apartment, though it was not his assigned spot.
Michael, another resident, recalled he heard that Rodger had stolen an item from Hong, so Hong stole the candles to retaliate.
