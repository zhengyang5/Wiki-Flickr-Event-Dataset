LOS ANGELES — A drive-by shooter went on a “mass murder” rampage near a Santa Barbara university campus that left seven people dead, including the attacker, and seven others wounded, authorities said Saturday.
Deputies found him dead with a gunshot wound to the head, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether he was killed by gunfire or if he committed suicide, he said.
The rampage broke out around 9:30 p.m. in the student enclave reputed for parties, including an annual spring bash that turned into a violent blowout last month.
A student told KEYT-TV he saw shots fired from a BMW, fatally striking one woman and critically injuring another woman.
Last month, an annual spring bash spiraled into violence as young people clashed with police and tossed rocks and bottles.
