GOLETA, Calif. (AP) — It was Friday night when Elliot Rodger’s mother got a call from her son’s therapist that he had emailed a ranting manifesto about going on a deadly rampage.
The mother went to her son’s YouTube channel and found the video in which he threatens to kill people.
“They’re in deep, deep grief,” family friend Simon Astaire said Sunday as he recounted the family’s ordeal.
He posted at least 22 YouTube videos.
In the final video posted Friday, he sits in a black BMW in sunset light and appears to be acting out scripted lines and planned laughs.
