For one, women know this.
Before what Iâ€™m saying starts edging into mansplaining, let me note that also over the weekend, the hashtag #YesAllWomen started.
The #yesallwomen hashtag is filled with hard, true, sad and angry things.
I can empathise & try to understand & know I never entirely will.
And that is, sadly, why we so very much need the #YesAllWomen hashtag.
