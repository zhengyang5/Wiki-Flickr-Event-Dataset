A gunman killed six people and wounded at least seven more in a series of drive-by shootings late Friday near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, authorities said.
"This incident appears to be a mass-murder situation," Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said at a news conference.
The shootings broke out in the Isla Vista neighborhood near UC Santa Barbara around 9:30 p.m., local time, Friday night.
Brown said there were nine separate crime scenes, and that the fatalities were "spread throughout the Isla Vista area."
