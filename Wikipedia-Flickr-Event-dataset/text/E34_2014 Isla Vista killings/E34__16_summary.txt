Witness Robert Johnson describes the scene outside an Isla Vista deli when a drive-by gunman opened fire into the crowd.
Woman Ran From Drive-By GunfireA reporter with the UCSB student newspaper describes a witness account of coming face-to-face with a gunman who went on a shooting rampage Friday May 24, 2014 in Isla Vista.
Isla Vista RampageThe shooting rampage occurred after he stabbed three male victims to death at his apartment, authorities said Saturday evening.
"The guy stuck his head out and says, 'Hey, what are you doing,' She ignored him, thinking he was just the 'typical, Isla Vista douche bag.'
The mass killing comes about 13 years after a former UC Santa Barbara student drove his car through a crowd of people in Isla Vista, killing four.
