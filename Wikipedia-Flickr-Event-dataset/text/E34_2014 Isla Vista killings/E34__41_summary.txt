UCSB students wearing tassels, stoles, and cords flooded the streets of Isla Vista as their time to walk across the stage at the UC Santa Barbara Faculty Club Green, drew near this past Saturday, June 14.
“We’ve come together with support and kindness,” said UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang from the stage.
The commencement ceremony was wreathed by the UCSB Lagoon, harmonizing with sea birds squawking in the shining sun.
Yang illustriously mentioned that UC Santa Barbara is among the top two percent of all universities in the United States and Canada.
Multiple student speakers addressed the graduating class of 2014, with grace and wise words attained from their experience at UCSB.
