YAOUNDE (Reuters) - A twin suicide attack by suspected Boko Haram militants in the northern Cameroon town of Fotokol late on Sunday killed at least 13 people including a Chadian soldier, authorities said.
Cameroon president’s office said in a statement on Monday that 10 civilians, a Chadian soldier and the two assailants were killed in the attack.
The first explosion went off inside a bar near a Cameroon special forces camp just after sundown as people were breaking the Ramadan fast, a senior Cameroon military officer told Reuters earlier, asking not to be named.
L’Oeil du Sahel, a newspaper in northern Cameroon, said the two attackers wore women’s burkas.
Chad, Niger, Cameroon, Nigeria and Benin have launched a joint military operation to fight the insurgency, which has killed thousands and threatens to destabilize the region.
