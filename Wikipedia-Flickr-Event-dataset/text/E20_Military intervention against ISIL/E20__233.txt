Australia has completed a second humanitarian aid drop to assist the people of Iraq.



A Royal Australian Air Force C-130J Hercules aircraft has delivered 15 bundles of Australian humanitarian supplies to isolated civilians in the Northern Iraqi town of Amirli.



The supplies included high energy biscuits, bottled water and hygiene packs which are designed to feed and hydrate 2600 people for 24 hours.



It follows an Australian humanitarian aid drop on 14 August, which delivered nine tonnes of supplies to Yezidi civilians, trapped on Mount Sinjar in the country’s north.



The Australian Defence Force stands ready to provide further air-lift assistance to Iraq with the movement of stores including arms and munitions.



Australia’s contribution in Iraq will continue to be coordinated with the Iraqi government, regional countries and our international partners.



This commitment follows Australia’s humanitarian aid contribution and will help the people of Iraq to confront the threat of ISIL extremists and efforts to prevent the humanitarian crisis from deepening.



Royal Australian Air Force C-130J Hercules and C-17A Globemaster aircraft are available to support this task.



This is consistent with similar assistance being provided by the United States, Albania, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom.
