The Royal Air Force is already flying missions over Libya in preparation for a possible invitation by a Libyan government of national unity to help its army stabilise the country, including combating the growing threat of Islamic State (Isis), Tobias Ellwood, the foreign office minister, said on Tuesday.
The forces would also help to train the Libyan patrol and facilities guard, responsible for protecting the vital oilfields.
Ellwood was pressed to disclose how many missions the RAF had flown, and whether they involved the use of drones, but he refused to do so.
Britain has been reported to be looking to join an Italian-led force that would help to train and assist a Libyan army once a government of national unity is formed.
He admitted â€œIslamic State were taking full advantage of the vacuum that it faces due to the political chaos.
