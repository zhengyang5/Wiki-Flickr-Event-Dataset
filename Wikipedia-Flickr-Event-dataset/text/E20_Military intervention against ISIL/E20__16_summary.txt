THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) â€” The Dutch government is sending six F-16 fighter jets to strike at the Islamic State extremist group in Iraq, Deputy Prime Minister Lodewijk Asscher announced Wednesday.
The Dutch also will send about 130 military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground.
Defense Minister Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said the Dutch jets will likely be based in Jordan.
Asscher acknowledged that the Dutch role in the fight against Islamic State brings risks not only to the troops and pilots involved, but also at home.
"The threat profile is monitored permanently and our security services are prepared."
