Since the granting of parliamentary approval last month the UK has conducted air strikes on multiple ISIL targets in northern Iraq, operating from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.
If strike operations are required then Reaper has the ability to complement the sorties RAF Tornados have already completed.
The deployment is the first operational use of UK Reaper outside Afghanistan.
The policy for the use of unmanned aircraft is the same as that for manned aircraft, with the RAF pilots operating under strict UK Rules of Engagement.
Training Kurdish forcesThe deployment of Reaper to the Middle East coincides with the conclusion of the first UK training programme for Kurdish forces in Northern Iraq.
