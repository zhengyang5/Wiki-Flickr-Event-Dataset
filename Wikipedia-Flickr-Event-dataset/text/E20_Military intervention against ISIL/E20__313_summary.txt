Canadian fighter jets helped to destroy heavy engineering equipment that was being used to divert the Euphrates River to flood areas nearby while denying water to Iraqi civilians further away, Lt.-Gen. Jonathan Vance said Tuesday.
In one case, the Canadian Aurora surveillance aircraft participated in "the destruction of a key ISIL base," Vance said.
Vance says the four targets were near a dam west of Fallujah and consisted of heavy engineering equipment and vehicles.
CP-140Sunday's mission lasted approximately four hours, Nicholson's statement said, and included an air-to-air refuelling of the fighter jets by a CC-150 Polaris aircraft.
The fight against ISIS, Vance said, "will be led by the Iraqis themselves and that is why we are actively supporting them."
