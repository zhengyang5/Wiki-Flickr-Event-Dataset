WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration is flying armed aircraft over Iraq, defense officials said on Friday, adding that the flights were aimed at gathering intelligence and ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel on the ground rather than conducting strikes.
“What I would tell you is that we continue to fly both manned and unmanned aircraft over Iraq at the ... Iraqi government’s request, predominantly for reconnaissance purposes.
Some of those aircraft are armed,” Rear Admiral John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters.
“The reason that some of those aircraft are armed is primarily for force protection reasons now that we have introduced into the country some military advisers whose objective will be to operate outside the confines of the embassy,” he said.
The Obama administration also has been working to speed up delivery of U.S. weaponry that Iraq is buying from the United States.
