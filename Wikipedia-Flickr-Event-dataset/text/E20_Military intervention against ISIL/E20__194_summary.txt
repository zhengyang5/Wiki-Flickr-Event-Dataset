Russia has already conducted more than 1,000 airstrikes in Syria this year amid a continued push to beat the Islamic State group, according to a top Kremlin general.
As a result, hundreds of cities, towns and villages in Syria were liberated from ISIS control in 2015 and thus far in 2016, Lieutenant General Sergey Rudskoy, chief of the main operations department of the Russian General Staff, reportedly said.
Russian air force jets had hit military infrastructure, oil producing and processing facilities, and areas where militant military equipment was kept, said Rudskoy, according to a report by Tass, a Russian news site based in Moscow.
Prior to Monday's report of innocent casualties, Russia's biggest airstrike successes had been achieved in the provinces of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama, Homs, and Raqqah, according to Rudskoy.
U.S. officials are keen to work with Russia to contain and destroy ISIS, but Washington, D.C., is concerned about Moscow’s insistence to keep Assad’s regime in power.
