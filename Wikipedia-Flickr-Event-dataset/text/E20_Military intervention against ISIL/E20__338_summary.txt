The cuts to the CIA program are included in a preliminary intelligence spending bill that is expected to be voted on in the House next week.
The measure has provoked concern among CIA and White House officials, who warned that pulling money out of the CIA effort could weaken U.S.-backed insurgents just as they have begun to emerge as effective fighters.
A separate Defense Department program authorized to train moderate fighters to combat the Islamic State has not yet begun.
The move by the House intelligence panel to cut the programâ€™s funds is not mentioned in the unclassified version of the spending bill.
The chairman of the House intelligence panel, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), declined a request for an interview.
