There remains some confusion as to whether the growing visibility of the now-familiar IS black flag in Afghanistan constitutes the presence of an actual Islamic State group affiliate.
Some of these are believed to be former Taliban fighters who have broken with the organization and adopted the IS flag out of convenience.
Fighters from the two internal Taliban factions have already come into open conflict inside Afghanistan, according to senior Taliban official Ahmad Rabbani.
In February, a U.S. airstrike killed a group of alleged IS recruiters there, according to Afghan officials and the Pentagon.
In the northern provinces of Faryab and Sar-i-Pul, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or IMU declared their loyalty to the Islamic State group earlier this year.
