After ISIS stormed into Mosul, one official recalled a startling phone call from a former major general in one of Mr. Hussein’s elite forces.
About one-third were military officers during Mr. Hussein’s rule, and nearly all were imprisoned by American forces.
The last two leaders of ISIS’s military council were former Iraqi military officers: a colonel and a captain.
Members of Mr. Hussein’s Baath Party were barred from government positions, and the political dominance of Iraq’s Shiite majority made many Sunnis feel disenfranchised.
For those who had served in Mr. Hussein’s staunchly secular army, that transformation was complete by the time they joined ISIS.
