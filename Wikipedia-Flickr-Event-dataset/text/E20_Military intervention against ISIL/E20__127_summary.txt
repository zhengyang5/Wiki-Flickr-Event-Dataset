This brings the total number of aircraft of different types at the Bassel al Assad air base to at least 20.
With these aircraft deployments and the continued arrival of combat helicopters, the Russian contingent in Latakia is growing to a point where it could conduct combat operations.
Since Sept. 4, when the first imagery of Bassel al Assad air base was taken, at least 15 more helicopters have appeared.
Russian and Syrian strategists now need to take the steps to integrate this proliferation of air power.
The group launched several Grad artillery rockets in the direction of the air base, claiming to have hit a Russian transport aircraft.
