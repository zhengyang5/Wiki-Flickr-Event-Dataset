UNITED NATIONS â€” Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says Islamic State fighters in Libya are facing the "distinct possibility" of defeat in their last stronghold and are likely to scatter elsewhere in the North African country and the region.
According to one unnamed U.N. member state, Ban said dozens of Tunisians fighting for IS have already returned home "with the intent to conduct attacks."
He said the largest group of foreign fighters currently operating in Libya are individuals linked to IS, and they dominate the extremist group's top leadership.
Foreign fighters have also joined Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb which periodically infiltrates Libya and uses the country as a rest stop and for training and buying arms, he said.
Another prominent group of foreign fighters in Libya are members of Ansar Al-Sharia in Tunisia, another al-Qaida affiliate, which continues to train its forces in Libya near the Tunisian border, the secretary-general said.
