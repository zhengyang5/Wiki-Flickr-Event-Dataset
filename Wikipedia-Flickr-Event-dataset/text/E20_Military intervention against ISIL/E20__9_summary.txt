Francois Hollande told reporters that French air strikes would only target the jihadist group's positions in Iraq, and not neighbouring Syria.
At his twice-yearly news conference in Paris on Thursday, Mr Hollande said that he had told the authorities in Baghdad that France was now ready to carry out air strikes.
"It will be air support to protect Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish peshmerga forces to reduce and weaken this terrorist group," he added.
It has not ruled out air strikes in Iraq or Syria, but has said targeting IS positions in the latter would be complicated.
