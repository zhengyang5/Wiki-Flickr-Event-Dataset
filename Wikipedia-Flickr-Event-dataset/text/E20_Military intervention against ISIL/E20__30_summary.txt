Pakistan’s army says it has killed more than 100 “terrorists” in 24 hours of mass security operations following an Isis suicide bombing that killed more than 80 people.
A spokesperson for Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff said the military would act for security against “all types of threat”.
Isis claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at the famed Lal Shahbaz Qalandar shrine in Sehwan, where Sufi Muslims had gathered to perform the dhamaal ritual.
At least 83 people were killed and hundreds injured in the blast, which was the deadliest attack in Pakistan for two years.
Sufis, who can be both Sunni and Shia, practice a form of Islamic mysticism that is held to be heretical by salafi jihadist groups like the Taliban, Isis and al-Qaeda.
