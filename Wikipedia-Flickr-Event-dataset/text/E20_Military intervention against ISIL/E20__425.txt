AUSTRALIAN forces fighting against terrorists in Iraq have helped reclaim more than 800 square km of territory from ISIS.

The Herald Sun can reveal new details of Australia’s efforts in the Middle East following an exclusive interview with Defence Minister Kevin Andrews on Operation OKRA.

About 600 ADF troops have been deployed to the Middle East as part of operation OKRA — Australia’s contribution to the international fight against the Islamic State — since the mission began in September.



BULLETS AND BURQAS A CHILLING MIX

Following talks at the Australia-UK Ministerial consultations (AUKMIN) yesterday, Mr Andrews told the Herald Sun Australia was playing a “very critical part” in the operation to defeat ISIS.

In the past month Australia’s air force dropped 45 laser-guided and GPS-guided bombs, targeting both Islamic State fighters and key logistics bases.

More than 6000 ISIS fighters have been killed in Syria and Iraq since fighting began but the threat is far from over, with the number of ISIS fighters swelling to as many as 31,500, including 3000 Western fighters.

In a history-making 16-hour missions, the crew of Australia’s Wedgetail aircraft operating over Iraq set a new record for the longest Australian air mission in a war zone.

Australia has also ramped up its strategic support with its air-to-air refuelling aircraft clocking up more hours in the past month than any time since Australia joined the combat mission.

Mr Andrews said terrorism remained a “real threat” to Australia.

“The first priority of a government is the safety and security of its people,” he said.

“The Daesh death cult is an assault on our very values and we must defeat it.”

Mr Andrews said he was proud of the contribution Australia was making to the coalition fighting against ISIS.

“The defeat of Daesh death cult is in everybody’s interest,” he said.

About 200 Air Task Group (ATG) personnel have now rotated back to Australia after a four month deployment.
