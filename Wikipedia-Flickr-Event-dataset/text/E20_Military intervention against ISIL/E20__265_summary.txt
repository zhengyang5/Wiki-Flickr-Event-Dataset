The developments were the first confirmation that international forces were on Mount Sinjar.
“They were being guarded by the Kurds.”The team that landed on Mount Sinjar on Wednesday conducted a reconnaissance mission before returning to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, officials said.
“Today a team of fewer than 20 US personnel conducted an assessment of the situation on Mount Sinjar.
All personnel have returned safely to Irbil by military air,” a US defence official said, on condition of anonymity.
Nearly all those to have escaped have done so from the northern flank of Mount Sinjar, which was cleared of Islamic State jihadists over the weekend.
