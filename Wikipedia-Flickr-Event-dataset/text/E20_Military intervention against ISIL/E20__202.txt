EU High Representative Federica Mogherini attended the first ministerial level meeting of the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which was held at the invitation of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Brussels on 3 December 2014.

The meeting brought together ministers from sixty partner countries to discuss the way forward in the fight against ISIL/Daesh.

The EU High Representative's presence at the Global coalition meeting underlines the importance the EU attaches to the fight against ISIL/Daesh. Speaking in Brussels HR/VP Mogherini said: "Islam cannot and should not be identified with ISIL, which is a terrorist organisation and has nothing to do with religion".

Ministers attending the Global Coalition agreed on five priorities to counter ISIL/Daesh:

Supporting military operations, capacity building and training Stopping the flow of foreign terrorist fighters Cutting off ISIL's/Daesh's access to financing and funding Addressing associated humanitarian relief and crises Exposing ISIL/Daesh's true nature
