WASHINGTON — American warplanes attacked Islamic State group fighters in northern Libya on Wednesday, marking a third consecutive day of U.S. airstrikes in the war-torn nation.
Forces backing Libya’s U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord have been battling Islamic State group militants in Sirte for months.
The U.S. military has conducted nine airstrikes against Islamic State group targets since it began its new mission, entitled Operation Odyssey Lightning, this week in support of the GNA.
GNA forces control most of northern Libya, and they have been largely successful against the Islamic State group in Sirte, Davis said.
Airstrikes, which have destroyed key Islamic State targets, including a pair of tanks, have been conducted by manned and unmanned aircraft.
