Over 300 rebels were killed in the infighting, most of whom were executed Jaish Al-Nasr prisoners of war.
Some three convoys belonging to the HTS coalition were reportedly ambushed near Khan Sheikhoun.
Faced with the prospects of a protracted siege like Kafraya and Foua’a, HTS negotiated with Liwa’ Al-Aqsa offering a safe exit towards Islamic State territory in east Hama.
In return, Liwa’ Al-Aqsa would release its HTS prisoners and relinquish its heavy weapons and vehicles.
Liwa’ Al-Aqsa is estimated to number between a thousand and two-thousand men with some unconfirmed reports suggesting some 2,100 fighters joined the Islamic State in Raqqa.
