At least one C-17 US Air Force transport plane, commonly used for the transfer of weapons and ammunition, was seen leaving Tiranaâ€™s Mother Teresa Airport on Sunday.
The Islamic State, formerly known as ISIS or ISIL, was founded in the early years of the Iraq war, becoming known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
The US recently launched air strikes to halt its advance into the Kurdish region, which has taken in hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Christian and Yazidi refugees.
