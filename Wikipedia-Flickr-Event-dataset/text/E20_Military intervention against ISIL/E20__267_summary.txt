WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama has authorized the deployment of an additional 1,500 U.S. troops to Iraq to assist Iraqi forces in their fight against the militant group known as the Islamic State, the White House announced Friday.
There are now about 1,400 troops in Iraq participating in Operation Inherent Resolve, and the additional deployments will more than double the American footprint there.
CENTCOM also will establish four or five sites in northern, western and southern Iraq to accommodate the training of nine Iraqi army and three peshmerga brigades.
“Of course there is.”Kirby said the additional troops will begin to flow into Iraq later this month.
Officials indicated that more troops could be sent to Iraq in the future, depending on how well things go.
