Australia will end its airstrikes against Islamic State militant targets in Iraq and Syria after being part of a U.S.-led international coalition for more than two years.
Canberraâ€™s decision to stop its involvement in airstrikes on the insurgents was taken after consultation with Iraq and other allies.
Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said their firepower helped to defeat Islamic State, also known as Daesh.
Canberra says the work of training and advising of Iraqi forces would continue.
Earlier this month, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that his troops were now in complete control of the Iraqi-Syrian border.
