(Reuters)The Obama administration’s new proposal to Russia on Syria is more extensive than previously known.
It would give Russian President Vladi­mir Putin something he has long wanted: closer military relations with the United States and a thawing of his international isolation.
“The participants, through the JIG, should enable coordination between the participants for military operations against” Jabhat al-Nusra, the document states.
The Russian air force would still be permitted to strike Jabhat al-Nusra unilaterally if there were an “imminent threat” to their personnel.
While Jabhat al-Nusra is a problem, teaming up with the Russian air force might not be the best solution.
