Chief of joint operations confirms Isis casualties from Super Hornet strikes but will not elaborate on number of those killedAustralian air strikes in Iraq kill Isis fighters on 'at least two' occasionsAt least two Australian air strikes in Iraq have killed an unspecified number of Isis fighters, out of a total of 43 sorties by Australian Super Hornet jets, military chiefs said.
Australian planes had also been involved in strikes on an oil refinery, in a bid to destroy Isis revenue sources, Johnston said.
Johnston said the impact of the Australian strikes was direct, as well as creating a “morale” boost for Kurdish fighters which would challenge the view that Isis was invincible.
He said the 200 special forces remained in the United Arab Emirates, but still had not received legal clearance to enter Iraq.
The special forces, which have been waiting for clearance for almost a month, will “advise and assist” Iraqi special operation forces.
