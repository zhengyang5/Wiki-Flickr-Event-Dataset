The US state department welcomed the end of the "vile occupation" of IS in Iraq and said the fight against the group would continue.
The jihadist group had seized large swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, when it proclaimed a "caliphate" and imposed its rule over some 10 million people.
The Iraqi armed forces issued a statement saying Iraq had been "totally liberated" from IS.
