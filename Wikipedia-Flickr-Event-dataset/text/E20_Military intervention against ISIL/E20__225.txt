BEIRUT // Hizbollah is fighting ISIL in Iraq, the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah revealed for the first time on Monday in a speech broadcast to supporters in southern Beirut.

“We may not have spoken about Iraq before, but we have a limited presence because of the sensitive phase that Iraq is going through,” Mr Nasrallah said in reference to ongoing clashes between Iraqi troops, several militias and Kurdish forces against ISIL.

Hizbollah is already fighting in Syria, alongside president Bashar Al Assad’s forces.

Mr Nasrallah’s speech comes two days after his leading Lebanese opponent, Saad Hariri, called on Hizbollah to withdraw from Syria.

“I say to those who call on us to withdraw from Syria, let’s go together to Syria,” he said.
