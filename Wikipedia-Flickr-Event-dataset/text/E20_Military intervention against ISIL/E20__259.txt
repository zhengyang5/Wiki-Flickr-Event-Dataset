US troops have captured Baghdad airport as coalition forces edged closer to the gates of the Iraqi capital, according to reports.

Tanks and armoured units met almost no opposition from Iraqi forces as they seized Saddam Hussein international airport, the US ABC television network reported.

It said reporter Bob Schmidt, embedded with the 3rd Infantry Division, was standing on the airport tarmac when he filed his report.

"US forces encountered very little Iraqi resistance," said Schmidt, "although some units of the 3rd Infantry Division did encounter scattered firing by Iraqi foot soldiers and men in pick-ups."

He also reported seeing Iraqis waving and cheering as US tanks rolled towards the airport which is just 10 miles from central Baghdad.

Sky News correspondent Colin Brazier, also with the 3rd Infantry, said: "Privately the Americans are saying they are in charge."

He said: "They didn't think there was a possibility that the airport would simply be surrendered in the way it appears to have been."

Sky News correspondent David Chater, in Baghdad, said: "I was at the Saddam International Airport late this afternoon and there seemed to be no real strong Iraqi military presence.

"There were no tanks, no artillery, nothing I could see that showed that this was going to become a front line.

"Maybe it is a cake walk into the Saddam International Airport. Maybe the Iraqi's are leaving an open door."
