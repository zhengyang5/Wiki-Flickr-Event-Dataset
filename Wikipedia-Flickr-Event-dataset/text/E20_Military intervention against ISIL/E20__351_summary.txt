Jordan will execute Sajida al-Rishawi, the failed female suicide bomber whose release was sought by the Islamic State militant group, at dawn on Wednesday, a Jordanian security official said.
The report comes shortly after the group released a video showing the death of a Jordanian fighter pilot it has held since December.
Last week, militants threatened to kill captured Jordanian pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh if al-Rishawi was not released.
Jordan said it was willing to exchange al-Rishawi for the pilot, but demanded proof of life first.
On Tuesday, the group released a gruesome video that appeared to show al-Kaseasbeh being burned alive.
