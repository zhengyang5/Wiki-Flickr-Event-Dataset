Under this mission, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) is training the Forces armées nigériennes (FAN).
Through this mission, the CAF is helping Canada’s ongoing work to build the Nigerien military and security forces’ capacity.
The CAF training consists of two- or three-month serials.
At that time, the CAF sent Canadian Special Operations Forces members to Niger.
In 2016, the Canadian Joint Operations Command took over the mission from the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command.
