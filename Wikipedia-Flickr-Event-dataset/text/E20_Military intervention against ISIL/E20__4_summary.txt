Today, Defence Minister Harjit S. Sajjan announced that the Government of Canada is extending Canada’s current military contribution to the fight against Da’esh until June 30, 2017.
The scope and mission of Canada’s military contribution will remain the same over the next three months, with a few adjustments.
There has been no change to their mandate or to the parameters of their mission.
Canadian troops remain behind the forward line of troops, and are providing advice and assistance to Iraqi Forces.
Canadians will be regularly updated as this mission continues to evolve.
