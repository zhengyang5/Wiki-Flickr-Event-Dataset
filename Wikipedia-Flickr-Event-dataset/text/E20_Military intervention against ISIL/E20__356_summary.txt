Air strikes were carried out on Thursday and a reconnaissance mission took place overnight last night.
US President Barack Obama has spoken with David Cameron and welcomed the UK air strikes, the White House said.
The six Typhoons now at RAF Akrotiri left RAF Lossiemouth in Moray on Thursday to join the air strikes following the vote to allow air strikes to be extended from Iraq.
Earlier, David Cameron insisted conducting air strikes against IS in Syria would help to bring a political settlement to the country.
Air strikes were launched shortly after MPs overwhelmingly backed UK military action against IS in Syria, by 397 votes to 223, after a 10-hour Commons debate on Wednesday.
