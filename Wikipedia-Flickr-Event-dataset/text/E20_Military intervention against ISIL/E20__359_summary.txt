A US military airstrike has killed the Islamic State’s leader in Libya, the Pentagon said on Saturday.
The Pentagon said Nabil’s death “will degrade [Isis’s] ability to meet the group’s objectives in Libya”.
Egypt bombed the city of Sirte, Libya, where the executions took place.
Four years after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Isis has steadily grown in Libya, controlling Sirte.
Tunisia says the suicide attacker who killed 38 tourists, 30 of them British, in Sousse in June was trained in Libya’s western Isis base, outside Sabratha.
