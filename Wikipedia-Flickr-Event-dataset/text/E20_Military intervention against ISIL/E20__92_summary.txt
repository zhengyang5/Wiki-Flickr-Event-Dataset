Commandos were among the first American troops to return to Iraq after Islamic State fighters swept through the country in early 2014.
However, U.S. Central Command—which oversees military operations in the Middle East—recently offered us a peek at the special operators’ activities.
On Nov. 14, CENTCOM posted a video in its YouTube channel showing the commandos’ airplanes and helicopters flying near Baghdad.
The video quickly disappeared, but we managed to save a copy before it did.
It should be possible to quickly turn an AC-130J into an MC-130J, and vice versa.
