Shakhuan Abdullah, a member of Iraq's parliamentary defence committee, told the Anadolu Agency that the existence of Iranian soldiers in Iraq is no longer hidden.
“Iranian soldiers are found in areas of conflicts with Islamic State in Iraq,” Abdullah said.
The actual number of Iranian soldiers killed is widely expected to be higher than that legally declared.
“There are no Iranian soldiers in Iraq and all the news published about their existence is untrue,” Tarafi said.
Apart from these volunteer fighters, he said, there are no Iranian soldiers in Iraq.
