Founded in 2011, Ahrar al-Sham was first led by Hassane Abboud, who also used the alias Abu Abdullah al-Hamawi.
Also known by the alises Abu Jaber al-Maskani and Abu Jaber al-Sheikh, he was not from either Idleb or Hama.
Abu Jaber al-Maskani Steps DownAbu Jaber’s appointment as Ahrar al-Sham leader was only set to last for one year.
Like Abboud and so many other early Ahrar leaders, Abu Yahia is also a son of the Ghab Plains.
According to the senior Ahrar al-Sham leader Khaled Abu Anas—who is himself from Saraqeb in the Idleb area—Abu Yahia hails from Qalaat al-Madiq.
