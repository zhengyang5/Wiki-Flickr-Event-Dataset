Last month fewer than 200 Marines set up the outpost, which has at least four M777A2 howitzer artillery guns. It marked the first time since U.S. forces returned to Iraq in 2014 that Americans have set up a quasi-permanent presence on the ground outside the perimeter of a major Iraqi military installation. The firebase is about 15 miles from territory controlled by the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
