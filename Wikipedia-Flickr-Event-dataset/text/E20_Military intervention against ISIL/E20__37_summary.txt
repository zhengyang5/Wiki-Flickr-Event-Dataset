Tehran's interventions in Iraq and Syria highlight the strange alliance that has emerged because of the Islamic State's ongoing battlefield gains.
Obama has called on Assad to step aside, but U.S. officials have privately welcomed the Syrian leader's ongoing airstrikes against Islamic State targets within his borders.
Meanwhile, Obama has American warplanes bombing targets in Iraq in unspoken support of the Iranian forces helping their Iraqi counterparts on the ground.
Iraqi security forces, Shiite militias, and Iranian operatives fought the Islamic State on the ground while U.S. air power took out Islamic State targets with a barrage of airstrikes.
The Pentagon said it could not provide an estimate for Iranian forces, but they are believed to number in the several hundred.
