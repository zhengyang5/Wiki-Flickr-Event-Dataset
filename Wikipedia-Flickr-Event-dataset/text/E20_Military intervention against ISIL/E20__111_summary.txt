Expected to start in the coming weeks, the US-led programme will train and equip thousands of screened members of the opposition over the next three years to help them defend Syrian communities against ISIL’s brutal attacks before leading offensives themselves.
Alongside the substantial training contribution, the UK will also provide headquarter staff to coordinate and develop the programme.
The training will take place in Turkey and in other countries in the region that are members of the anti-ISIL coalition.
This effective and closely coordinated activity in conjunction with Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces has largely stalled the terrorists’ advances.
In Syria, coalition airstrikes have supported the liberation of Kobane and have disrupted ISIL’s logistics and supply lines.
