Australia's cabinet has authorised military air strikes on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group on Iraqi territory and the deployment of special forces troops to combat the fighters.
"Yes, it is a combat deployment, but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of Iraq and ultimately the people of Australia from the murderous rage of the ISIL death cult," Abbott said.
On Thursday, Turkey's parliament authorised the government to carry out military operations in Iraq and Syria to fight ISIL and other armed groups.
'ISIL in retreat'The announcement that Australia will participate in air strikes came days after its military jets took part in support missions over Iraq with the US-led international coalition.
The Australian deployment also includes a 200-strong ground force, including special forces, to advise security forces inside Iraq, plus 400 air force personnel.
