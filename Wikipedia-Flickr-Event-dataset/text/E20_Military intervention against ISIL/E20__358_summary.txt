Fighters pledging allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have released a video purporting to show the killing of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians kidnapped in Libya.
The men were seized in two attacks in December and January from the coastal town of Sirte in eastern Libya.
Later, state television reported that Egypt's military had bombed ISIL targets in Libya at dawn on Monday.
The UN's mission in Libya called for the group's actions to be "rejected and denounced by all Libyans".
Sunday's video comes less than two weeks after ISIL released a video showing the burning alive of a Jordanian pilot it captured after his plane went down in Syria in December.
