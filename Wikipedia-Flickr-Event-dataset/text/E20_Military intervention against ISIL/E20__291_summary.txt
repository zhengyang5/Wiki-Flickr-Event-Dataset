Asked by Reuters after his meeting with German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier about Barack Obama's proposal for air strikes against Isis in Syria, Hammond replied: "Let me be clear: Britain will not be taking part in any air strikes in Syria.
Russia's foreign ministry earlier said that air strikes on Isis in Syria without a UN security council mandate would be an act of aggression.
The British government considers the issue of air strikes in Syria to have been discussed by MPs last year and does not want to revisit it.
Hammond told MPs on Wednesday: "There is a qualitative difference between any proposition of air strikes in Syria and such an activity in Iraq.
The legal, technical and military differences make the proposition of air strikes an order of magnitude more complicated in Syria."
