Libyan forces show munitions they said they captured from Islamic State militants during a battle in Sirte, Libya August 31, 2016.
The loss of Sirte would compound Islamic State setbacks suffered in Syria and Iraq.
“When our forces gather, Daesh (Islamic State) fighters stage a retreat in order to send a car bomb.
Almost all of Sirte’s estimated population of 90,000 fled the city after Islamic State took over or as the battle began.
Any families that remain are those of Islamic State fighters, Shukri said.
