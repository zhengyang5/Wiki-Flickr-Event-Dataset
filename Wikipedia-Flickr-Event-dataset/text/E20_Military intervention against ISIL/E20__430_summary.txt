(CNN) As many as 50,000 ISIS fighters have been killed since the war against the terror group began, a senior US military official told CNN.
It recruited only several hundred foreign fighters this year, compared with a couple thousand a month last year, CNN has learned.
The matter has caused bureaucratic headaches inside the Pentagon and Congress over the question of whether special operations forces like Delta Force and Navy Seals will operate overseas more than they already do.
The official insisted special operations have no new authorities to operate.
But special operations forces will set up a new center to coordinate their operations with coalition forces and other government agencies at an "undisclosed location," the official said.
