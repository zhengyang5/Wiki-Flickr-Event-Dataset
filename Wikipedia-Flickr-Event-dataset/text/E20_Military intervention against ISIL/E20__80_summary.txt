SAN DIEGO (CNS) - The San Diego-based aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson Monday turned over command of operations in the Arabian Gulf to another flattop, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and is preparing to sail home.
The Vinson departed San Diego last August and began flight operations against Islamic State targets two months later.
Thomas reminded his crew and their family members to be security conscious when posting on social media.
It was not immediately clear when the Vinson will return to San Diego.
The Theodore Roosevelt, which had been based on the East Coast, will transfer its home port to San Diego when its deployment comes to an end.
