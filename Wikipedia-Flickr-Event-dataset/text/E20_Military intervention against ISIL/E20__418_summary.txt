The United States is sending up to 300 troops, along with surveillance drones, to Cameroon to bolster a West African effort to counter Nigeria's Boko Haram armed group.
"The total number of US military personnel to be deployed to Cameroon is anticipated to be up to approximately 300," Obama said.
The statement said the personnel had been deployed at the invitation of the Cameroon government.
US officials said the troops would provide intelligence to a multinational task force being set up to fight Boko Haram and composed of troops from Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Chad and Benin.
"This deployment will be part of an effort to conduct airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations in the region," Earnest said.
