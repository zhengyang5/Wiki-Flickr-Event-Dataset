NICOSIA (Reuters) - Cyprus’s facilities are available to France to fight Islamic State after the wave of attacks across the French capital, the Mediterranean island’s foreign minister said on Thursday.
French army soldiers secure the area around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle as it leaves the naval base of Toulon, France, November 18, 2015.
Cyprus is the closest European Union member state to Syria, lying about 70 miles off its shores.
It is already being used as a staging post by British sovereign bases on the island to attack Islamic State targets in Iraq.
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulidis said there had been no request so far for assistance from France, but Nicosia would help if required.
