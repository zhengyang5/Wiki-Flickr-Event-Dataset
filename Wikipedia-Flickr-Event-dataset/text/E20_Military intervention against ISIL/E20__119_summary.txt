Michael Fallon says UK is only country flying manned spying missions over Syria, calling Isis ‘a fascist enemy prepared to kill civilians and opponents alike’RAF steps up Iraq and Syria spying missions in 'new Battle of Britain'The RAF is stepping up its spying missions over Iraq and Syria in operations against Isis fighters, described by the defence secretary on Thursday as “a new Battle of Britain”.
Clearly stung by criticism that Britain was contributing little to the US-led campaign of air strikes, Michael Fallon said Britain was the only country flying manned spying missions over Syria as well as Iraq.
The RAF is preparing to deploy a second Airseeker over Iraq and Syria, Fallon disclosed.
Britain is expanding its fleet of surveillance aircraft at a time when the RAF strike wing is under severe pressure.
The government is unlikely to approve bombing missions over Syria until after the Labour party has elected a new leader.
