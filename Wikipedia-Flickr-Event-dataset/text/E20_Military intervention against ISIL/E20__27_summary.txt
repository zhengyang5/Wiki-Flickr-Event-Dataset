On Thursday, the Greek Foreign Ministry announced that Greece will vouch its political and military support for the coalition against the Islamic State.
Greece will lend humanitarian and military aid to the American-led coalition, officials said.
The Greek General Staff has also decided to send ammunition to Kurdish forces battling the Islamic State.
The aforementioned ammunition includes bullets for Kalashnikov firearms confiscated by Greek authorities.
They are not state-owned weapons, but have filtered into Greece from eastern countries.
