Four separate air arms are now active over Iraq, which is fighting a desperate battle against invading ISIS militants coming from Syria.
Iraq, Syria and—possibly—Iran have bombed ISIS.
A photo that circulated in the attack’s aftermath depicted a deep crater that appears to be bigger than any of Iraq’s warplanes could have inflicted.
Iraq’s air arms possess helicopters and lightweight propeller-driven planes whose biggest weapons are 100-pound Hellfire missiles.
The Iranian air force possesses around 80 F-4 and Su-24 bombers as well as F-14 interceptors modified for ground strikes.
