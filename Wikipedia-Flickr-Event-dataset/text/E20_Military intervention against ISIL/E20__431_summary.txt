More than 5,700 air strikes have been launched in the campaign, which nears its first anniversary this Saturday, with its impact on civilians largely unknown.
However, over six months, Airwars examined 118 air strikes and identified 52 that Woods said “warrant urgent investigation”.
Making things more complicated, emotive footage or reports of civilian deaths are used for propaganda by all sides of the chaotic war.
Woods, from Airwars, said the US-led campaign’s focus on urban areas made civilian deaths unavoidable, despite “significant efforts” to avoid them.
Even the highest estimates of civilian deaths in international air strikes are dwarfed by numbers believed killed by Syrian regime barrel bombings and Iraqi government air strikes, and by armed groups including Isis and al Nusra Front.
