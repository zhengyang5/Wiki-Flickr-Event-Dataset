The mission, which dropped around 100 bombs on Wednesday, is thought to be the last signed by President Barack Obama as he prepares to leave office.
The strikes hit military camps run by IS and located about 30 miles (45km) south-west of the coastal city of Sirte - an IS stronghold until the group was driven out in December.
Two B-2 bombers flew a round-trip of around 34 hours from Missouri, US military officials said.
Libya has become increasingly divided since Gaddafi's fall, with competing governments and rival militias seeking to gain territory and influence.
