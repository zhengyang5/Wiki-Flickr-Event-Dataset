The gruesome video came after a week-long drama over a possible prisoner exchange by Jordan to win the release of Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh.
Reports by Reuters and Agence France-Presse, citing unnamed sources, said Jordan planned to execute al-Rishawai, the Iraqi prisoner, by dawn Wednesday in Jordan.
Al-Kaseasbeh was captured by the Islamic State — also known as ISIL or ISIS — in December after his aircraft crashed over Syria.
In Jordan, a tense situation was developing as protests erupted in Amman and the pilot's home village of Ai on Tuesday night.
The 22-minute, 34-second video shows media footage depicting Jordan's participation in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State.
