OTTAWA —Canadian special forces soldiers on a “non-combat” mission in Iraq have been giving directions to fighter jets to bomb Islamic State positions and have exchanged gunfire with extremists, the military said Monday, revealing a more involved role for Canadians than previously disclosed.
On 13 occasions, Canadian soldiers have also helped guide CF-18s to bomb targets, including one time when troops took a photo of two ISIL fighters with a machine-gun.
Rouleau said special forces troops help make air strikes “faster, it’s more efficient .
As well, a Canadian military medical team with surgeons and trauma nurses is also on the ground in northern Iraq.
The six-month Canadian mission, opposed by both the Liberals and New Democrats, is due to expire in April unless extended.
