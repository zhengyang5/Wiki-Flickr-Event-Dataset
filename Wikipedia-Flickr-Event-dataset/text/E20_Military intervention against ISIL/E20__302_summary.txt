The estimated number of ISIL fighters killed as a result of UK strikes from September 2014 to 31 August 2015 is around 330.
This figure is highly approximate, not least given the absence of UK ground troops in a position to observe the effects of strike activity.
We do not believe there have been any civilian casualties as a result of UK strike activity.
Any overall estimates would be a matter for the coalition.
