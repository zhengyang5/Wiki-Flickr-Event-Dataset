Its involvement in the campaign will shorten the time it takes for French jets to carry out air strikes.
The Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier has already been deployed against IS.
The ship - France's only such vessel - was used as a base for French jets in the Gulf from February to April.
The aircraft carrier can hold up to 40 aircraft and support 100 flights a day.
The Charles de Gaulle carrier is usually accompanied by several frigates, a refuelling ship and an attack submarine, according to Reuters.
