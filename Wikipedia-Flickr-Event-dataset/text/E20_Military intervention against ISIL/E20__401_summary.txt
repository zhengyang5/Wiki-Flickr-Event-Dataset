Story highlights 8 of the 29 killed worked in ISIS radio and Internet operations, an Afghan official saysThe U.S. military got the legal authority to strike ISIS in Afghanistan last month(CNN) U.S. airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan killed 29 ISIS fighters and struck the terrorist group's FM radio station, signaling American forces' continued military action in the war-torn nation -- albeit against a different entity that brought them there in the first place.
Khogyani said the 29 killed included eight ISIS members who worked on the group's radio and online efforts.
Until then, ISIS propaganda could be heard on the radio station in Nangarhar's capital of Jalalabad.
Khogyani said the U.S. strikes not only hit the radio facility but destroyed the Islamic extremist group's internet equipment.
U.S. Army Col. Michael Lawhorn, a spokesman for American forces in Afghanistan, confirmed "two counterterrorism strikes" in Nangarhar province.
