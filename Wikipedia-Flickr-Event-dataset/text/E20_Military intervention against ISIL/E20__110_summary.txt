This will bring the number of UK personnel in Iraq to more than 300.
Mr Fallon said there had been "solid progress" in recent months against the so-called Islamic State group, which controls parts of the country.
"Now is the time to step up our training of Iraqi Forces, as they prepare for operations in key cities such as Fallujah and Mosul," Mr Fallon said.
He said: "The US-led coalition though is also under pressure to address the aftermath of war - how to help rebuild and repopulate towns and cities like Ramadi recently liberated from so-called Islamic State."
