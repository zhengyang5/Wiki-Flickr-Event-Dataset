Al-Qaeda senior official in Syria's Idlib, Radwan Nammous, also known as Abu Firas al-Suri, was killed in US strike on Sunday.
Abu Firas al-Suri was the official spokesman of the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front in Syria.
Speaking to ARA News in Idlib, Nusra member Abu Saeed al-Holandi confirmed the death of al-Suri along with ten others in the American airstrike that targeted Kafr Jalis district in Idlib province on Sunday.
“Unlike other members of Nusra’s top echelon, al-Suri appeared publicly and moved around, especially as clashes started between ISIS and other jihadists in Syria.
So far, the US-led coalition that operates fighter jets in Syria has not released any statement concerning al-Suri’s death.
