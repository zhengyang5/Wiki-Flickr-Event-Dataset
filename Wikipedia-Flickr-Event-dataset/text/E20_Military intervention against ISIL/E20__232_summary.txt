Air Commodore Noel Derwort, Deputy Commander Joint Task Force 633, said meticulous planning had gone into the mission and he was not surprised by its success.
“The entire Joint Task Force had been focused on ensuring we could deliver critical humanitarian aid to the people stranded in northern Iraq,” he said.
The operational air drop was the first mass air delivery of humanitarian cargo since the outbreak of violence in Timor Leste in 1999.
The Australian Hercules was one of a 16-aircraft package including USAF C-17s and C-130Hs and a British C-130J to respond to the humanitarian disaster.
