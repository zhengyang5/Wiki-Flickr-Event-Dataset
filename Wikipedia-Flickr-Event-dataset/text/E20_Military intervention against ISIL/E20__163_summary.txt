Eighteen ISIS militants were killed in the firefight.
A source with the Afghanistan army told Fox News that ISIS hasn't been considered a major threat in the country, where the local army and U.S. forces have been more focused on routing the Taliban.

The bombing came just days after a U.S. Army special forces soldier was killed in the region.
