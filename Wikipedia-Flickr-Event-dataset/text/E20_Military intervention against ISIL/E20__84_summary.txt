As the U.S. begins bombing ISIS targets in Syria with a campaign of airstrikes that started Monday, a venerable airplane that was almost sent to the scrapyard joins the fight.
But with defense cuts looming and the Afghan war winding down, the Thunderbolt seemed on the way out.
A campaign spearheaded by Republican Sen. John McCain, sought to save it, claiming that the aircraft was the only U.S. jet to offer tactical and accurate support close to the ground.
Because it flies so low, the Thunderbolt is vulnerable to small arms fire and portable anti-aircraft missiles that cannot reach high altitudes.
That could result in ISIS taking down an A-10, as it has done with Syrian regime planes, and killing or capturing the pilot.
