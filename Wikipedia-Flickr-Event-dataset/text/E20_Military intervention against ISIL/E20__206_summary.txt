MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and Jordan have agreed to coordinate their military actions on Syria by setting up a “special working mechanism” in the Jordanian capital Amman, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday.
Jordan's King Abdullah (L) speaks with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, August 25, 2015.
Jordan, however, is Sunni-dominated and closely aligned with Washington, so Moscow’s deal with Jordan could mark a shift in the alliances engaged in the Syria conflict.
“The military of the two countries have agreed to coordinate their actions through a working mechanism in Amman, capital of Jordan,” Lavrov said in comments broadcast by Rossiya-24 television channel.
“We think that other states that participate in the anti- terrorist fight can join this mechanism as well,” Lavrov added.
