U.S. Africa Command officials today announced results of precision airstrikes conducted Aug. 16, against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant targets in Sirte, Libya.

Africom is conducting the strikes at the request of, and in coordination with, the Libyan Government of National Accord, officials said.

The following targets were struck by U.S. forces:

-- Seven enemy fighting positions.

-- Four vehicle-borne bombs.

-- One pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle.

-- Twelve enemy fighting positions.

-- One command-and-control vehicle.

These airstrikes bring the total number to 57, in support of Operation Odyssey Lightning, which began Aug. 1.

Officials said the U.S. stands with the international community in supporting the GNA as it strives to restore stability and security to Libya.

These actions and those taken previously will help deny ISIL a safe haven in Libya from which it could attack the United States and its allies, officials said.
