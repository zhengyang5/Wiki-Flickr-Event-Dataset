Coalition airstrikes killed the latest Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS)-appointed governor of Mosul on Thursday, according to Iraqi police.
Hassan Saeed Al-Jabouri, known as Abu Taluut, is the second ISIS governor of Mosul to be killed in December, CNN reports.
According to Maj. Gen. Watheq Al-Hamdani, the Iraqi police commander leading the governmentâ€™s efforts to retake Mosul, Jabouri was killed 29 km south of the city in the village of Qayyara.
Mosul has been a stronghold for ISIS fighters since they took the city from Iraqi forces earlier this year.
The Pentagon says they will move to retake the city beginning in January.
