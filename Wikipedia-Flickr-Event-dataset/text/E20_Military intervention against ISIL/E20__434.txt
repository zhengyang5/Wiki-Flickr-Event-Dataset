EDITORS PLEASE NOTE: THIS EDIT CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY 4:3 Near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, Kurdish Peshmerga forces assess the smoldering remains of vehicles. A Kurdish military source says their forces regained control of a crude oil facility late Saturday -- after Islamic State fighters seized the facility that morning. The men remove the mangled bodies of what's thought to be IS fighters. The U.N. says the fighting and other violence in Iraq killed nearly 1,400 people in January alone -- nearly 800 of them civilians. In Baghdad, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari told his visiting Austrian counterpart --- the fight against Islamic State is effectively "World War III" and that all the world's major capitols are under threat. (SOUNDBITE) (Arabic) IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER, IBRAHIM AL-JAAFARI, SAYING: "Economic markets, schools and all sorts of places frequented by human beings are under threat, therefore this is a world war. I believe the main concern for western countries and the European Union in particular is to prepare for this danger since the danger has already begun in some of the European capitals." Islamic State seized at least four small oilfields when it overran large parts of northern Iraq last summer. The militants sell crude oil and gasoline to finance their operations. The radical jihadist group has declared a medieval-style caliphate in parts of Iraq -- and Syria -- and poses the biggest challenge to the stability of OPEC members since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
