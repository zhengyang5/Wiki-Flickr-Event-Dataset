A Turkish soldier was killed and another wounded on Tuesday by cross-border fire from territory held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in neighboring Syria, a government official told Reuters.



The incident took place in the southeastern province of Kilis, abutting territory controlled by the militants for months.



Turkey in July stepped up its involvement in the fight against the group, launching air strikes and opening its air bases to the U.S.-led coalition.
