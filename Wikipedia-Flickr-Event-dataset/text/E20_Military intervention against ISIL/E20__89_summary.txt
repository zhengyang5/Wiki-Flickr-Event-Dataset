The imagery is used to assess the effectiveness of the strikes and some of those videos are released to the media, to underline the Pentagon's insistence that the raids are both lethal and accurate.While video and other imagery pours in, satellites and special aircraft act as the "ears" for intelligence gathering, picking up phone and radio communications -- known as "signals intelligence."
A key tool for eavesdropping includes RC-135 aircraft, which can intercept phone calls from an altitude of 30,000 feet.The US National Reconnaissance Office runs a constellation of secret spy satellites that can pick up electronic signals continuously over a wide area.
And the US Army has "Trojan" trucks outfitted with antennae that can swiftly trace the location of a phone intercept.Apart from sending in more spy planes and satellites, American intelligence agencies usually mobilize manpower and other resources to back up any major US military action, deploying CIA paramilitary operatives to work with local forces.During the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, Central Intelligence Agency officers acted as forward air controllers for bomber planes, while US special operations forces advised Northern Alliance troops attacking the Taliban.A similar model may be in effect in Iraq and Syria, with spotters for bombing strikes acting under the CIA's authority for covert operations.
US officials will not confirm or deny if that is the case.
The CIA also will be working to gather intelligence the old-fashioned way, using contacts in the Kurdish forces, Iraqi government and some rebel elements in Syria.Particularly in Syria, where Washington's spy network is considered weak, the Americans will look to Arab and other allies for insights into events there.
