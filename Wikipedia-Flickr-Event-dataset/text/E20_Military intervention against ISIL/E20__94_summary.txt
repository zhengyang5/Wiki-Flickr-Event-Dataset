The fuselages for the Global Hawk, whose latest version costs $80 million not counting development costs, are built by a staff of some 26 employees at Northrop-Grumman’s plant in Moss Point, Miss.
When programmed, the Global Hawk can take off and land autonomously.
It didn’t hurt that the production costs of the Global Hawk had declined.
Congress ordered the Air Force to keep buying the aircraft.
This summer, the Air Force ordered three more Global Hawks and retrofits of two that were acquired earlier.
