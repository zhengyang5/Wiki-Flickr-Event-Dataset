WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Barack Obama has authorized surveillance flights over Syria, two U.S. officials said late Monday, a move that could pave the way for U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State militant targets.
While the White House says Obama has not approved military action inside Syria, additional intelligence on the militants would likely be necessary before he could take that step.
The White House would not comment on Obama's decision to authorize surveillance flights over Syria.
The U.S. had already stepped up its air surveillance of the Islamic State inside Iraq earlier this year as Obama began considering the prospect of airstrikes there.
The Islamic State is among the group's seeking Assad's ouster, along with rebel forces aided by the U.S.
