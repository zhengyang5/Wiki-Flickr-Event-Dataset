Isis has lost a staggering number of jihadists and has only killed three US troops in return, making the US-to-Isis "kill ratio" 15,000-to-one.
Earlier this year, President Barack Obama declared the group had lost swathes of territory and said its fighters "realise their cause is lost".
Advances by Iraq's army and allied militia towards its most important possession of Mosul have put the group under renewed pressure.
Adnani was believed to be the second most important leader of Isis after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and was one of the group's longest-serving members.
Among senior Isis officials killed in air strikes this year are Abu Ali al-Anbari, Baghdadi's formal deputy, and the group's "minister of war", Abu Omar al-Shishani.
