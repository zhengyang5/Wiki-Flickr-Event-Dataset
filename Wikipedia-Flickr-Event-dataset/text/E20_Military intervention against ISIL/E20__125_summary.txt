The Russian military build up continues as six Su-34 Fullback attack planes arrive in Syria.
Six Sukhoi Su-34 aircraft have eventually arrived at Latakia to join the Russian contingent already there.
Images allegedly shot around the al-Assad International Airport clearly show one Russian Fullback about to land at the airbase in western Syria where 28 Russian aircraft have arrived last week.
One of the photos taken from the ground shows the six aircraft trailing what seems to be an airliner over Idlib: the larger plane is probably a Russian Air Force Tu-154.
