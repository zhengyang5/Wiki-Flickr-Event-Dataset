One year ago Parliament endorsed the use of military force to assist the Iraqi government in its fight against ISIL terrorists. The UK is part of a much wider effort by a 62 nation global coalition to drive back Daesh (as they are known in the region) and their false ideology.

Our part in this is called Operation SHADER.

There are two parts to our military effort -

1. Help train and equip Iraqi security forces to defeat Daesh

2. Providing air support to find and destroy the terrorists.







The operation isn't just a combat mission, we've also delivered much needed humanitarian assistance.

One year ago aid was flown from Cyprus to minority communities fleeing ISIL terrorists. These air drops helped sustain Yazidi refugees on Mount Sinjar until Kurdish forces freed them.
