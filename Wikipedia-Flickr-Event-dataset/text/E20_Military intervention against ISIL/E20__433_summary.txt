Members of the civil defense search for bodies in the rubble of a building in the Mosul al-Jadida neighborhood of Mosul.
[Mosul residents say U.S.-led coalition airstrikes killed scores of people]In a statement U.S. Central Command said it had received multiple "conflicting allegations" placing a strike in the area sometime between March 17 and 23.
In addition to the March 17 strike in Mosul, the U.S. military is now investigating a separate attack this month alleged to have killed scores of civilians at a mosque in Syria.
An Iraqi military commander suggested the large death toll in the March 17 incident may have been partially caused by the fact that a missile struck a car bomb, unleashing a giant explosion.
An Islamic State headquarters was discovered in a building nearby.
