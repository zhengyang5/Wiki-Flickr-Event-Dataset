Mr Hussein says that the peshmerga has been impressed during the fighting by Isis's training and discipline.
"They will fight until death, and are dangerous because they are so well-trained," said Mr Hussein.
Overall, Mr Hussein says he does not see any convincing sign of resistance from the Sunni Arabs.
The Iraqi army might be acceptable in Sunni areas but only if it is reconstituted so that is not dominated by the Shia.
Mr Hussein did not say so, but it may be too late to establish a competent cross-confessional regular army in Iraq.
