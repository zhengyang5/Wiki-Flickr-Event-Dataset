The issue threatened to create some turbulence as Trudeau arrived in Paris for the start of UN-sponsored climate negotiations that formally get underway Monday.
"Prime Minister Trudeau has not yet explained how withdrawing Canada's CF18s from the air combat mission will help our coalition partners defeat ISIS.
Standing at a podium beside Trudeau in the ornate Elysee, Hollande said the two had spoken about the security situation, the battle against radicalism and diplomacy.
"But we also have to act militarily, " said Hollande, adding Trudeau had affirmed Canada's solidarity in the global fight and that each country should contribute "within their own means."
Trudeau, in turn, responded that "we will make sure that we all play a role in order to curb this terrorist threat."
