A US-led coalition set up to fight Islamic State has bombed the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and another radical faction in northwest Syria.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said a series of air strikes had targeted Nusra Front, including in Idlib province in northwest Syria, where last week the organisation routed Western-backed Syrian rebels.
Residents today said one of the air strikes targeted a car used by Nusra commanders, near an internet cafe in the Nusra-controlled town of Sarmada, close to the Turkish border.
A rebel from another Western-backed group operating in northern Syria confirmed the air strikes on the Nusra Front and on Ahrar al-Sham, and said they took place at around 1 am.
The United States is planning to expand military support to what it describes as the moderate opposition to Dr Assad as part of its strategy against Islamic State in Syria.
