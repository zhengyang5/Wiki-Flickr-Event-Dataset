The US-led coalition against the Islamic State militants that have seized large areas of Iraq and Syria is prepared to battle the jihadists “for as long as it takes”, US Secretary of State John Kerry told coalition members in Brussels Wednesday.
Kerry said the airstrikes have already compromised the Islamic State group's leadership and "inflicted damage on its logistical and operational capabilities".
But Kerry went on to note that the fight against the Islamic State group will not be successful if coalition partners rely on military tools alone.
“This is far more than simply a military coalition,” Kerry said.
... And these are the areas that were really the primary focus of today’s discussion," he said, using the Arabic term for the Islamic State group.
