If reports Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. aristrike are true, his loss raises the question of whether ISIS can survive or thrive without him.
The self-proclaimed title of caliph of the Islamic State is more than a figurehead for the group.
But those who wield the most decision-making power are right below him in the chain of command, the Shura Council and Sharia Council.
A good caliph needs to come with the full package, or have so secret a history, the Shura Council can create its own ideal candidate.
Squires speculated Baghdadi’s two deputies -- Abu Ali al-Anbari (deputy of Syria) and Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (deputy of Iraq) -- could be on the shortlist along with Abu Suleiman -- ISIS’ shadowy war council leader.
