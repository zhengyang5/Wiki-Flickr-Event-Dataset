'Heaviest yet'US Central Command said it carried out nine air strikes on Saturday, hitting targets near Irbil and Mosul dam.
A Kurdish commander, Major General Abdelrahman Korini, told AFP that the Peshmerga had captured the eastern side of the dam and were "still advancing".
Rudaw, a Kurdish news website, said the air strikes appeared to be the "heaviest US bombing of militant positions since the start of air strikes" against IS last week.
At least 11 IS fighters were killed by the air strikes, sources in Mosul told BBC News.
