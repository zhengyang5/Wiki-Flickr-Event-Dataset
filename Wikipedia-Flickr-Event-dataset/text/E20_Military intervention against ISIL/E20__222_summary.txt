During the last Iraq war, Hezbollah effectively used a limited number of special operations personnel to train Iraqi Shiite militants and support sporadic special operations targeting coalition forces.
Past Activity In IraqBeginning in 2003, Iran's Qods Force requested Hezbollah's services to help increase Tehran's influence in Iraq.

This type of contribution would not overstrain the organization, and it could facilitate far-reaching achievements for Iraqi Shiite militias.
