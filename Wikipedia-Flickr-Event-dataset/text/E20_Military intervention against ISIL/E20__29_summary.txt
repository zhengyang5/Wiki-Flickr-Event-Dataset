The United Arab Emirates, a key Arab member of the US-led coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), has not flown combat missions over Syria since last December, US officials say.
"I can confirm that UAE suspended air strikes shortly after the Jordanian pilot's plane went down," AFP news agency quoted an unnamed US official as saying.
Even after the UAE stopped flying the missions, the US military has continued to state in daily news releases about the air campaign that the UAE is among coalition partner nations "conducting air strikes in Syria".
Apart from the UAE, Bahrain, Jordan and Saudi Arabia take part in US-led air raids in Syria, which began in September.
The US plays a dominant role in the air war, carrying out at least 80 percent of the raids, according to officials.
