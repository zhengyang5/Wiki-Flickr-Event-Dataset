Public approval of military intervention is high for a nation that is famous for its post-second world war reluctance to deploy troops and that prides itself on its pacifist stance.
About 58% of Germans are in favour of military intervention in Syria, and 34% support direct participation in airstrikes.
But a majority say they believe the mission will increase the risk of Germany being a target for terrorists.
But Norbert Röttgen, of Merkel’s conservatives and chairman of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, staunchly defended the operation, saying that without military intervention “diplomacy would not stand a chance”.
He said the German military was already overstretched due to its involvement in a range of ongoing foreign missions and would have to be topped up with more personnel.
