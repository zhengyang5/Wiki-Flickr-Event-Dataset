With the kidnappings on Thursday and the fighting on Friday, the number of US-trained fighters put out of action by Nusra’s campaign has risen to 30.
The source said the Division 30 fighters were planning a military offensive in northern Aleppo against Isis after entering Syrian territory from Turkey.
He said one of the kidnapped men was the overall commander of Division 30.
It was unclear if the latest air strikes were in response to Nusra’s assault on the US-trained rebels.
Late last year, it launched a devastating campaign against the Hazm Movement, a US-trained group, looting its stores of Tow anti-tank missiles.
