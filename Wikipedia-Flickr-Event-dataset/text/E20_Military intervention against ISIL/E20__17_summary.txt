LONDON (Reuters) - Britain would consider “positively” any request for arms from the Kurds to help them battle Sunni militants who have seized much of Iraq, a spokeswoman for the prime minister said.
REUTERS/StringerThe United States has asked European countries to supply arms and ammunition to Kurdish forces, U.S. and European officials have said.
“If we were to receive a request then we would consider it positively,” the spokeswoman said on Friday.
In a statement following a meeting of the British government’s Cobra emergency committee on Thursday, London confirmed it would continue transporting military equipment from Eastern Europe to the Kurdish forces.
The BBC earlier quoted Downing Street sources as saying that the Kurds had not yet asked Britain for direct help but that any request would be considered with an open mind.
