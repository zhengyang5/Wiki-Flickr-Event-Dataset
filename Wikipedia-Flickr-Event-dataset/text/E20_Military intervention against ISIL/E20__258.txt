JOINT BASE LANGLEY-EUSTIS, Va. (AP) â€” Along southern Virginia's coast, the Air Force's F-22 Raptor routinely puts on a dazzling show of loops, dives and combat maneuvers designed to bedevil opponents before they ever know it's there.

But in its first months of combat in the skies above Iraq and Syria, the stealthy jet's contribution has been more of an escort role, guiding and protecting other fighters that are actually dropping the bombs.

In the nearly 10 months the Raptor has been flying combat missions against Islamic State militants, the F-22 fighters have flown just 204 sorties, or missions. In contrast, the U.S. and coalition aircraft have flown nearly 44,000 sorties since last August.

Air Force leaders say that the Iraq and Syria deployments have given them greater insights into the aircraft.
