Washington (CNN) Two U.S. officials told CNN that the Obama administration has assessed that ISIS senior operative Omar al-Shishani is dead.
But ISIS' media wing, the Aamaq agency, posted a statement online Tuesday saying that a source denied that Shishani had been killed.
He was killed along with 12 additional ISIS fighters in a wave of strikes by drones and manned aircraft.
U.S. officials had emphasized at the time it was publicly announced that they were not certain of his death and were assessing whether the strike killed him.
Also known as Omar "the Chechen" al-Shishani, he was born Tarkhan Tayumurazovich Batirashvili and once served in an elite Georgian military unit.
