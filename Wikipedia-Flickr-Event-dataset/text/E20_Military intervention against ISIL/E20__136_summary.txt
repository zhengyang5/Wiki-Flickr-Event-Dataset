ISIS emerged in Libya in 2015, first in the eastern city of Darnah where it was ousted in July.
ISIL is an acronym used by the U.S. government for the Islamic State, which is also commonly referred to as ISIS or IS.
"Simply declaring the Islamic State is neither Islamic nor a state until we're blue in the face is not a strategy," he said.
Disclosure of increased ISIS inroads into Libya comes as airstrikes were reported Monday against ISIS targets in several Libya cities, including Benghazi, Ajdabiya, Bin Jawad, and Sirte.
ISIS fighters were able to set five oil tanks on fire at the facility.
