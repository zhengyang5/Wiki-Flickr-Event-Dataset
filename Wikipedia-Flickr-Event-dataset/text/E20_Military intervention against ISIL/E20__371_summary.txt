A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, said Marine AH-1W SuperCobra helicopters participated in strikes against the Islamic State over the weekend.
According to a U.S. Africa Command release, U.S. forces conducted nine strikes from Friday to Sunday, targeting Islamic State fighting positions and vehicles.
The Islamic State fighters have retreated "to the densest, most built-up part of the city," the official said.
Helicopter gunships are usually best directed to their targets when they receive directions from combat air controllers on the ground, known as JTACs.
The MEU has been almost entirely responsible for the strikes against the Islamic State in Sirte, though the aircraft flying from the Wasp is only one component of the unit.
