The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said the airstrikes were a direct retaliation for the Paris attacks, which he said were masterminded by Isis leaders inside Syria.
Isis’s media arm, Amaaq, claimed the sites hit by French bombs had already been abandoned and that nobody was killed in the strikes.
A senior French security official told the Associated Press that French intelligence received such warnings “all the time” and “every day”.
The New York Times, citing French and US officials, reported that the attackers communicated “at some point beforehand” with Isis members in Syria.
Isis claimed responsibility for the latest attacks in a statement released online on Saturday, blaming France’s participation in US-led airstrikes against its forces and positions in Syria.
