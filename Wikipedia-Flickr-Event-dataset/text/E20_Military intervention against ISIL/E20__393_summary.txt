LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is to send troops to Tunisia to help prevent Islamic State fighters from moving into the country from Libya, the British defence minister has said.
A security checkpoint is pictured at the Ras Jdir border, between Libya and Tunisia, 175 km west of Tripoli December 15, 2014.
The move comes after growing Western concern that Islamic State (IS) is seeking to use Libya as a base to plan and carry out attacks.
Fallon said Britain was not currently planning to deploy ground troops to Libya in a combat role.
“Before taking any military action in Libya, we would seek an invitation from the new Libyan Government,” he said.
