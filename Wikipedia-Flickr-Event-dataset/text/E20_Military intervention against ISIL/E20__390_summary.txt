Britain has discreetly deployed military advisers to Libya in order to build an army to fight Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant cells in the country, The Sunday Telegraph has been told.
Special forces commandos are said to be working alongside their US counterparts in the city of Misrata to stop the jihadistsâ€™ progress in the lawless terrain across the sea from Italy.
The British government has refused to comment on whether it also has special forces soldiers on the ground in Libya, where David Cameron gave enthusiastic backing to the armed uprising five years ago that unseated Colonel Gaddafi.
With that still looking like a somewhat distant prospect, Western capitals are considering more immediate options to quell Isil in Libya before it grows too strong.
Those appear to involve special forces working with local militias on the ground in both Misrata and Benghazi, either side of Sirte.
