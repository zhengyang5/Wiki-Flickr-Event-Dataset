BAGHDAD -- Iraq said Saturday that its war on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is over after more than three years of combat operations drove the extremists from all of the territory they once held.
ISIS fighters overran nearly a third of Iraqi territory, including Mosul, the country's second largest city, in the summer of 2014.
In November, Iraqi forces retook the last town held by ISIS -- Rawah, near the border with Syria.
Over the following weeks Iraqi forces continued to clear patches of the country's vast western deserts.
In the most significant victory over the extremists, Iraqi forces retook Mosul earlier this year.
