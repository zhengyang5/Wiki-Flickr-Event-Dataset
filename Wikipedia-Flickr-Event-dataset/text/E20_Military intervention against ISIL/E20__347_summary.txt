The strikes in Syria "destroyed or damaged" multiple targets, according to the U.S. military, which reported "all aircraft safely exited the strike areas."
The mission was not limited to hitting Islamic State positions.
The statement used an Arabic name to refer to the Islamic State group, which is more commonly known as ISIS or ISIL.
The following day, at a conference with Secretary of State John Kerry, key Arab allies promised they would "do their share" to fight the Islamic State militants.
Some officials have expressed concern that going after Islamic State militants in Syria could inadvertently help Assad, since the militants are fighting in part to overthrow Assad.
