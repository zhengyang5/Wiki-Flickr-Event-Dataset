Rear Adm John Kirby said the US, which has conducted its own air strikes in Iraq, was not co-ordinating with Iran.
Without confirming the air strikes directly, a top Iranian official also dismissed talk of co-operation.
Military analysts said earlier this year that Iran was supplying Iraq with Soviet-built Sukhoi Su-25 attack jets to help in the fight against IS.
Shia militias trained and funded by Iran have also been sent to Iraq to support Kurdish fighters battling IS militants.
