US President Barack Obama has authorised air strikes against Islamic State group targets inside Syria for the first time, pledging to destroy its fighters "wherever they exist".
"Our objective is clear: We will degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL (Islamic State) through a comprehensive and sustained air strikes strategy.''
"President Obama is trying to send a message to the public that this is not another full-blown war.
In recent weeks, the Islamic State group has released videos depicting the beheading of two American journalists in Syria.
Earlier on Wednesday, John Kerry, US secretary of state, said the international community will not sit and watch the Islamic State grow.
