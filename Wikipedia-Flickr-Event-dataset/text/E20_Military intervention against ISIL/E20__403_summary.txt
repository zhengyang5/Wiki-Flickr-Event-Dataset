Afghan forces and U.S.-led coalition airstrikes have killed some 43 fighters with the Islamic State group in eastern Afghanistan, Afghan officials said Tuesday, Stars and Stripes reported.
The extremist group, also known as ISIS, has sought to carve out a stronghold in the conflict-ravaged country but has been pushed back by both the Afghan government and Taliban fighters.
Fresh fighting erupted this year between the two groups after hundreds of Taliban fighters launched assaults against ISIS bases, taking two districts in eastern Afghanistan.
A spokesman for NATOâ€™s Resolute Support Mission, Col. Michael Lawhorn, confirmed that a U.S. strike was carried out in eastern Afghanistan Monday.
Last month, President Barack Obama gave the green light to target ISIS sites in Afghanistan, responding to an attack on a Pakistani consulate.
