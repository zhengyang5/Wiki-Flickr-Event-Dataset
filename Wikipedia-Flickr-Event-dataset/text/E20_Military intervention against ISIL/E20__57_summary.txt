Dead: Abu Alaa al-Afri, the terrorist standing in for injured Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed in an air strikeThe Iraqi military has revealed the moment the terrorist commander standing in for injured Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was blown up alongside dozens of his followers in a coalition strike on a mosque.
Dramatic footage posted to YouTube by the Iraqi Ministry of Defence showed what it claimed was the moment two missiles struck a mosque in Tal Afar, killing the brutal extremist groupâ€™s No2, Abu Alaa al-Afri.
