Dozens of people have been killed in clashes between Islamic State militants and Afghan forces as the extremist movement renewed efforts to seize parts of eastern Afghanistan.
Fighters pledging allegiance to the movement, also known as Daesh, attacked police checkpoints in the Kot area of Nangarhar province.
The assault comes just three months after the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, said the militant movement had been wiped out in Afghanistan.
Saleem Khan Kunduzi, Nangarhar province governor, said: "There is no doubt that Daesh do not respect anyone.
Sediq Ansari, the head of Afghanistan's civil society federation, blamed local leaders for failing to tackle the threat from Islamic State.
