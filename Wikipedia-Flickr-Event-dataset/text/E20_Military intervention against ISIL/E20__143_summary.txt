In a remarkable new video released by the Islamic State militants, British hostage John Cantlie gives a tour of the Syrian city of Kobane and denounces Western coverage of the fighting in the city.
However, the new video, released Monday via social media accounts linked to the Islamic State, appears markedly more professional than the previous ones.
Cantlie says the area is now controlled by the Islamic State, and he goes on to call Western media's reporting on Kobane inaccurate.
At the end of the video, Cantlie says that media reports are wrong and that fighting in Kobane is almost over.
Cantlie was taken hostage by the Islamic State in November 2012, at the same time as American journalist James Foley, the first hostage whose execution was filmed and shared on the Internet.
