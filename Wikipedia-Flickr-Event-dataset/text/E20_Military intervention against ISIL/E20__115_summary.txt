The UK Royal Air Force has conducted 159 air strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq with Panavia Tornado GR4s since deploying the type to the region late last year, the Ministry of Defence has revealed.
Details of the combat activity were disclosed during a visit to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus by defence secretary Michael Fallon on 1 March.
An undisclosed number of the service's General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Reaper unmanned air vehicles are also being operated in the area.
The MoD also has revealed that its Akrotiri-based Reapers conducted eight surveillance missions over Syria during January.
“No UK Reapers have discharged weapons in Syrian airspace,” the MoD notes.
