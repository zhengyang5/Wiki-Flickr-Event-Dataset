Cabinet approves Australian airstrikes in IraqTHE Abbott government has given the go-ahead for Australian Super Hornet fighter-bombers to begin airstrikes on Islamic State terrorist group targets in Iraq.
“I have to warn that this deployment to Iraq could be quite lengthy,” the Prime Minister said in Canberra.
It would be a dangerous mission but it was not strictly true to say Australia was at war, the Prime Minister said.
“We’re not trying to build liberal pluralism in Iraq, we’re not trying to create a shining city on a hill.”Mr Abbott said “only Iraq can defeat ISIL, but Iraq shouldn’t be alone”.
“No, we don’t support Australian troops on the ground in Iraq,” she told the Nine Network.
