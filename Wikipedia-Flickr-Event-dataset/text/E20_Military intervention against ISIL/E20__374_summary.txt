President Obama is expected to extend the bombing campaign against ISIS in Libya for a second time, three U.S. military officials with knowledge of the request told Fox News.
The decision authorizes the U.S. military to launch a third month of airstrikes against ISIS in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte.
The initial plan called for the two warships to remain off Libya for one month only.
The U.S. military is now conducting airstrikes against terror groups in six countries: Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia.
In June, CIA Director John Brennan said there were 5,000 to 8,000 ISIS fighters in Libya.
