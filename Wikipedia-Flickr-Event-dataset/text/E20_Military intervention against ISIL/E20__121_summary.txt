MOSCOW (Reuters) - Three serving or former Russian soldiers have been geolocated by photographs in Syria, including locations near Hama, Aleppo and Homs, Russian bloggers said on Sunday, suggesting the Kremlin’s operation stretches well beyond its air campaign.
Sunday’s report by Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), a group of Russian investigative bloggers, said that photos on social media had been used to geolocate three Russian serving or former soldiers in Syria.
Russia’s military jets are based in Latakia in western Syria, far from where the three men were geolocated.
He did not explain why one of his own pictures was geotagged Hama, Syria.
CIT, led by Ruslan Leviev, has previously worked to uncover information about Russian military deaths in Ukraine.
