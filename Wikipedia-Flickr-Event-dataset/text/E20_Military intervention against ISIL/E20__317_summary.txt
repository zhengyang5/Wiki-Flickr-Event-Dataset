Andrea Janus, CTVNews.caCanadian special operations forces came under ISIS attack for the first time in Iraq over the last week, and returned sniper fire to “neutralize” the threat, senior military officials revealed Monday.
According to Rouleau, special operations soldiers had just completed a planning session with senior Iraqi forces several kilometres behind the front lines.
Both Canadian and Iraqi soldiers responded with sniper fire, “neutralizing the mortar and machine gun position,” Rouleau said.
Some 69 special operations forces are engaged in an advisory and training mission in Iraq, Rouleau said.
At the same briefing, Lt.-Gen. Jonathan Vance said Canadian Forces are ready and able to remain in Iraq should the federal government extend Canada’s six-month airstrike mission.
