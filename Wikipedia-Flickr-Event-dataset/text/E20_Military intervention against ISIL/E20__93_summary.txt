US drones are being flown over Isil's Syrian "capital" for the first time as part of a drive by America to target Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the jihadist group's elusive leader.
Mr Obama immediately called Haider al-Abadi, the new prime minister, and urged him to move quickly to address "the legitimate grievances" of Iraq's disenchanted Sunnis.
John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said the formation of the unity government was "a major milestone" for Iraq.
But the all-important posts of interior and defence ministers would be filled over the next week, Mr Abadi told MPs.
Raqqa, a key city in Isil's embryonic "state", would need to be scrutinised closely in any hunt for Baghdadi.
