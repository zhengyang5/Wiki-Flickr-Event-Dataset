But the man known as the "Shadow Commander" and "Dark Knight" in Western media is not Iraqi — he's a loyal commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
He’s essentially Iran’s viceroy for Iraq," said Jim Phillips, Middle East analyst for conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.
That Soleimani, in his late 50s, continues to hold sway in Iraq is not surprising — despite Iraq and Iran being historic arch-enemies, Phillips added.
Soleimani and Iranian leaders were bitter ideological foes with Saddam, undermining the late dictator's control and supporting his overthrow.
Soleimani, however, has shed his "shadowy" persona, said Scott Lucas, a professor of international politics at the U.K.'s University of Birmingham.
