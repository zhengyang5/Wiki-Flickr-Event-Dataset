Bush on August 1, 2014 in the Gulf (AFP Photo/Joshua Card)Australian warplanes are being deployed to the Middle East to join the US-led campaign of air strikes on jihadist targets in northern Iraq, Defence Minister David Johnston said on Monday.
IS fighters are active in swathes of Iraq and Syria but Abbott has said Canberra had no plans to intervene in the latter country.
According to the Pentagon, US aircraft have carried out 178 air strikes against IS targets in Iraq since August 8.
Australia has announced tougher counter-terrorism measures to target its citizens who fight overseas due to fears that violent jihadist in Syria and Iraq will return home.
Australia's high-profile involvement in the US-led military effort gave it a prominent place in a statement IS posted Monday calling on Muslims to kill any citizen from a member country of the anti-jihadist coalition.
