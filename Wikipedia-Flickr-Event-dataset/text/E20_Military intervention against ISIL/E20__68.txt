Damascus, Syria – On Thursday, a huge explosion hit a building where leaders of the al-Nusra Front (Syria’s branch of al-Qaeda) were holding a meeting in the countryside of Idlib, northwest of Syria, pro-Nusra sources reported.

The Front said in a statement online that their military commander in Syria, Abu Humam al-Shami, was killed in the attack.

The attack is believed to have been caused by a U.S.-led airstrike against the Front’s headquarters in the town of Salqin in the northern countryside of Idlib, at the Syrian-Turkish border.

Furthermore, the leadership of the Joint Task Force of the international coalition said that the coalition’s warplanes launched 12 air strikes in the past 24 hours on locations of the Islamic State group (IS/ISIS) in Syria and Iraq.

The Joint Force Command said in a statement on Thursday that the air strikes targeted tactical units, combat outposts, military vehicles and headquarters belonging to IS insurgents who were stationed in the Hasakah countryside, in northeastern Syria. The Command didn’t mention any new strikes against headquarters of al-Nusra in Idlib.

The international coalition had targeted previously the headquarters of the al-Nusra Front in the countryside of Idlib and Aleppo in northern Syria several times.
