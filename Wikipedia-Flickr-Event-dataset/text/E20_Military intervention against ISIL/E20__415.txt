WASHINGTON â€” Two American troops were killed and a third was wounded while battling Islamic State loyalists overnight in eastern Afghanistan, U.S. officials said Thursday, marking the latest in a series of violent developments as the Trump administration contemplates whether to escalate the 15-year war.



The troops' identities were not immediately disclosed, pending family notifications. The wounded service member did not require medical evacuation, a U.S. military spokesman in Kabul, Navy Capt. William Salvin, told Military Times. He characterized the injury as a minor wound though it's unclear whether the service member has returned to duty. Year to date, three Americans have been killed in action in Afghanistan. At least 21 others have been wounded by the relentless violence there.
