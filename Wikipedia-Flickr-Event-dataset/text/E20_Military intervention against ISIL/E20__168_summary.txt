Chadian forces, who have taken a lead role in battling Boko Haram in recent days, fought alongside Niger troops on Friday.
The clashes in Niger came as regional efforts intensified to battle Boko Haram, which has waged a six-year insurgency centred in northeastern Nigeria, where the Islamists have seized swathes of territory.
Chad's army said it had killed more than 200 Boko Haram fighters in the clashes.
In response, Boko Haram launched a bloody counter-attack on the Cameroonian town of Fotokol, killing 19 soldiers and at least 81 civilians.
The Boko Haram conflict has killed at least 13,000 people and forced more than a million from their homes since 2009.
