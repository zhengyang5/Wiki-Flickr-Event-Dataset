STUTTGART, Germany — The Navy’s USS San Antonio is now serving in the Mediterranean Sea as part of Operation Odyssey Lightning, replacing another warship in a move that will alter the type of air power being brought to the fight in Libya.
The USS San Antonio replaces the USS Wasp as part of a planned switch, U.S. Africa Command said on Friday.
While Marine Harrier fighters have been a part of the operation aboard the Wasp, the San Antonio does not host fighters.
Prichard added that the San Antonio is “more than capable of sustaining the current mission.”The USS San Antonio joins the effort with UH-1 Y Hueys and AH-1 W Cobras from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit’s Aviation Combat Unit, VMM-264, AFRICOM said.
The USS San Antonio, a part of the Wasp Amphibious Ready Group, is now positioned off the northern coast of Libya, AFRICOM said.
