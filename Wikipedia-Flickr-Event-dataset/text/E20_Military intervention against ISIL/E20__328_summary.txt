A secret, failed mission by the United States military to rescue American hostages, including the slain journalist James Foley, has been described to The Telegraph.
The commandos used parachutes to jump out from Black Hawk helicopters, which had been "specially modified", officials in the United States have said.
"The commandos dropped from helicopters which were silent: you couldn't hear their engines or their rotor blades," Mr Raqqawi said.
The troops also conducted "house to house" searches of Uqayrishah, Mr Raqqawi said, including in the home of the eyewitness.
"The camp used to be very active," said Mr Raqqawi.
