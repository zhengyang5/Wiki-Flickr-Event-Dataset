U.S., Russia Working On A Plan To Coordinate Bombing In SyriaEnlarge this image toggle caption SANA via AP SANA via APThe U.S. and Russia are working on a controversial plan for greater military cooperation in Syria, where both powers are bombing the Islamic State but have starkly different views of the country's future.
"At present, the United States is not conducting or coordinating military operations with Russia," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday in response to the report.
Separate air campaignsThe U.S. has been bombing the Islamic State in Syria since the summer of 2014.
Syria could be more a liability than an asset for Russia.
The counterargument is that the U.S. has no good options in Syria, and cooperating with Russia to pound ISIS is the most practical way to work toward ending the war.
