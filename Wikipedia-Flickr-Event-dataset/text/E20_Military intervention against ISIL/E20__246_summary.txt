Since Friday, the U.S. has been bombing members of the Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaida.
During the past four days, the U.S. has carried out 17 strikes against Islamic State targets, using F-15Es, F-16s, F/A-18s and MQ-1 Predator drones.
Hawkish Republicans, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have called on Obama to attack Islamic State targets throughout Iraq and Syria.
Islamic State militants have overrun much of central and western Iraq, and Mayville anticipates that insurgent attacks will continue to stay on the offensive.
“We’ll have to wait and see and get a better sense on the ground before we can offer some options to the president,” Mayville said.
