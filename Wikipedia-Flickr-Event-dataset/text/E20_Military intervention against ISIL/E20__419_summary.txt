A US defense official told CNN this is the first US strike specifically targeting ISIS in Yemen.
The Pentagon said the ISIS camps -- located in Al Bayda Governorate, Yemen -- were used to "train militants to conduct terror attacks using AK-47s, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and endurance training."
"ISIS has used the ungoverned spaces of Yemen to plot, direct, instigate, resource and recruit for attacks against America and its allies around the world.
For years, Yemen has been a hub for terrorist recruiting, training and transit," the statement said.
