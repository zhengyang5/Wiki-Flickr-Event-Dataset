ISIS fighters in Iraq are bragging about an Iranian drone they claim to have captured.
Harmer added the drone “looks very similar to an Iranian Mohajer-4.”The drone’s existence inside Iraq points to Iran’s role in the country and its ongoing clashes with ISIS forces.
Iran has played a central role inside Iraq since before ISIS’s rise and has been helping direct military operations inside the country.
It might not even be the first Iranian drone that has fallen into the militant group’s hands recently.
What ISIS can do with the drone, assuming one is in their hands, is an open question.
