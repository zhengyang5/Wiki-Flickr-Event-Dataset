Story highlights U.S. Special Forces are taking the fight to ISIS inside LibyaU.S. surveillance flights are operating from the Sicilian island of PantelleriaThe U.S. estimates between 4 and 6,000 ISIS fighters are now in LibyaMisrata, Libya (CNN) It is a tiny, remote aircraft hangar, carved in the Sicilian rock decades ago, but now home to a new and vital front for the United States against ISIS.
U.S. Special Forces and surveillance flights are operating on the ground and over Libya as the West moves to boost security operations in the country to bolster Libya's increasingly desperate fight against ISIS.
Surveillance flights over the country's 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) coast have been in operation from the remote Sicilian island of Pantelleria for over a year, and Special Forces have recently increased their presence on the ground.
The U.S. presence in Libya was acknowledged by Pentagon officials in the past few days, who admitted groups of Special Forces were "meeting a variety of Libyans."
But the presence of these Special Forces teams in the strongholds of the other two groups claiming to be the country's legitimate government shows that America retains wider private contacts.
