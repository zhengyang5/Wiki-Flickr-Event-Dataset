Wednesday night, Canada's jets took out ISIS artillery that had been firing on Iraqi forces.
Joining the aircraft, which are stationed at an ally base in Kuwait, are 600 Canadian Forces personnel.
The artillery, says the Canadian Forces, had been tucked behind a tree line, firing at the Iraqis.
This would make it the first time that Canadian Forces took out ISIS fighters since the campaign began.
During Vance's press conference, VICE asked specifically whether the Communications Security Establishment, or CSEC, was involved in intercepting data that could help Canadian Forces identify targets.
