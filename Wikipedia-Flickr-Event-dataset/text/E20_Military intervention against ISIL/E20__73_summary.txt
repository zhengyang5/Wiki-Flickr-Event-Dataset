US officials previously thought Drugeon had been killed in a November 2014 drone strike, but the claim was later disproved.
"He's definitely dead," a US official told AFP on Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
According to that official, Drugeon was a "very key technical member" of the Khorasan group and an expert at making "non-metallic Improvised Explosive Devices" -- the military term for homemade bombs.
When contacted at his home in France, father Patrice Drugeon said he had received no official confirmation of his son's death.
