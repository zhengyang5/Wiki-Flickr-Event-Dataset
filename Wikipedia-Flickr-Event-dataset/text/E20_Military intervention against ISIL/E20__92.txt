Commandos were among the first American troops to return to Iraq after Islamic State fighters swept through the country in early 2014. But the Pentagon has provided few details about what these troops are up to.

However, U.S. Central Command—which oversees military operations in the Middle East—recently offered us a peek at the special operators’ activities. On Nov. 14, CENTCOM posted a video in its YouTube channel showing the commandos’ airplanes and helicopters flying near Baghdad.

“U.S. airman [sic] from air base Ali Al Salem, Kuwait, conduct a helicopter aerial refuel and a forward area refueling point … [on] 10 October, 2014 at Baghdad International Airport,” reads the official text at the beginning of the footage.

The U.S. Air Force’s headquarters in the region is cited as the source, but stateside public affairs officials for the unit said they were unaware the video had been posted on the Internet. The imagery is “UNREVIEWED and UNRELEASED,” according to the opening credits.

The video quickly disappeared, but we managed to save a copy before it did.

The footage opens with airmen singing as they load refueling gear into a C-130 cargo plane. American troops use this equipment to quickly set up portable gas stations to top up planes and helos.

The original title and credits say the aircraft in question is an AC-130 gunship, an attack plane that fires machine guns and cannons. It’s unlikely the Air Force would consign one of its few AC-130s to a non-combat role, but it’s at least possible the flying branch is experimenting with some of the newer gunships—to see whether they can perform other functions.

Indeed, the latest AC-130Js are basically just MC-130J commando transports with a few extra weapons. It should be possible to quickly turn an AC-130J into an MC-130J, and vice versa.
