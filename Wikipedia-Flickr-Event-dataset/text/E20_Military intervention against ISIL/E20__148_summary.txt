REUTERS/Youssef Boudlal The Kurds desperately need an influx of arms and supplies in order to be able to continue to hold their 600-mile long border against ISIS attacks.
This concern is especially true should ISIS launch a suicide blitz like it has done previously in Ramadi and Mosul.
ReutersThe risk of the Peshmerga being overwhelmed by a similar scenario is likely given that the Kurds lack proper supplies.
"[ISIS] target us with weapons that were abandoned in Ramadi," Mustafa Sayid Qadir, the minister of Peshmerga affairs, told The Journal.
"Wouldn't it have been better if the Iraqi army had given them to us instead of giving them to ISIS?"
