During the past few days, the extremist group known as the Islamic State has made significant advances.
It is evident, however, that the Islamic State has amassed enough manpower and resources to move against the Kurdish region.
It is also coordinating Iraqi air attacks against Islamic State targets relevant to the defense of the Kurdish region.
This could come in the form of U.S. airstrikes by unmanned or even manned platforms against Islamic State camps and supply routes.
The Islamic State has become a lethal and capable military force with control over oil fields and infrastructure critical to all of Iraq.
