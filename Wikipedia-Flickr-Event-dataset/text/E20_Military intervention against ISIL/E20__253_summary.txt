"We think it’s being very effective right now," said Air Force Maj. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, the assistant deputy chief of staff for Operations.
Since the air campaign began on Aug. 8, the Air Force has flown the vast majority of the airstrikes as well as the ISR and refueling missions, Harrigian said.
Overall, the Air Force has flown 70 percent of the total of 3,800 sorties by all types of aircraft, including 95 percent of the 1,300 tanker refueling missions, Harrigian said.
Because of the air campaign, the Islamic forces are no longer able to mass as they did in sweeping into Iraq over the summer, Harrigian said.
Their command and control capabilities and their oil resources have also been impacted, Harrigian said, but "they’re a smart adversary" and will adapt as the air campaign progresses.
