The forces, aligned to the UN-backed unity government in Tripoli, began the battle to retake the city last month.
A spokesman, Ahmed Hadia, told the BBC IS forces had weakened, but "not totally broken down".
The Misrata spokesman told the BBC that troops were finding fewer landmines or booby-trapped cars the deeper they moved into the city.
The anti-IS forces fighting in Sirte are largely made up of militia brigades from Libya's third largest city, Misrata.
