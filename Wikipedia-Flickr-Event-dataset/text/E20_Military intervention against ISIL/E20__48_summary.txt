A monitoring group said today that, following its takeover of the ancient city of Palmyra, Isis now controls more than 95,000kmÂ² of Syria, equating to more than half of the country's territory.
Forces loyal to the Syrian regime are retreating westward as president Bashar al-Assad seeks to consolidate key sites following rapid gains by Isis and other rebel forces.
However, according to Lev Yuriditsky, Syria analyst at Tel Aviv-based consultancy Max Security, the regime is losing momentum and will face further strategic losses in the near future.
"The regime forces are pressured in numerous directions and it's a very hard decision to choose where they are going to fight right now."
"For Isis, the capture of Palmyra is very significant and not necessarily for the reasons UNESCO would like to believe.
