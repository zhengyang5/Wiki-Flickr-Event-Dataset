TEHRAN, IRAN — An attack near Iran’s western border with Iraq has killed three Iranian border guards, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Wednesday.
The troops were killed on Tuesday night while patrolling along the border in western Kermanshah province.
The militants have snatched much of northern and western Iraq from the Baghdad government’s control.
“I say it again, such reports are incorrect.”There have been sporadic clashes in the past between Iranian troops and opposition groups in western Iran.
The last time was in October 2013, when fighters from the armed Kurdish rebel group known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan, or PEJAK, clashed with Iranian forces near the Iraq border.
