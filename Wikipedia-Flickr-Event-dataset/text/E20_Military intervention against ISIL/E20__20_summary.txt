The Ministry of Defence said the two Tornado jets carried out armed reconnaissance operations but did not conduct any air strikes.
The mission comes after Parliament voted by 524 votes to 43 to take action against IS in Iraq, but not Syria.
The Tornado jets have now returned to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, seven hours after they took off.
