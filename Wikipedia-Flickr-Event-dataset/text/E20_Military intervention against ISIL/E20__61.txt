The leader of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov announced the death of the Islamic State military commander "Omar the Chechen,” who threatened Russia with a jihadist onslaught.





Chechnya’s leader Ramzan Kadyrov posted a photo today (Thursday) on his Instagram account, which he says is proof.





“The enemy of Islam, Tarkhan Batirashvili, who called himself Omar Ash-Shishani has been killed," Kadyrov posted. "That will happen to everyone who will threaten Russia and the people of Chechnya. This will happen to everyone who sheds Muslims' blood."
