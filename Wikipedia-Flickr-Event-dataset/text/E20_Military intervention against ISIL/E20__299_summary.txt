Image caption Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff (L) and Ruhul Amin, from Aberdeen, travelled to Syria to fight with the so-called Islamic State groupTwo British Islamic State jihadists who died in Syria were killed by an RAF drone strike, David Cameron has said.
The "act of self defence" was lawful, despite MPs previously ruling out UK military action in Syria, the PM said.
Another British national, Junaid Hussain, 21 and from Birmingham, was killed in a separate air strike by US forces in Raqqa on 24 August.
The government will argue the air strike on Reyaad Khan was such a case.
But carrying out an RAF air strike in Syria will still be controversial; even more so because a British citizen was targeted.
