American intelligence officials say that ISIS has about 10,000 fighters — about 7,000 in Syria and 3,000 in Iraq.
ISIS fighters were the shock force that swept into Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, on June 10, counterterrorism officials said.
In Salahuddin, Sunni groups have sworn allegiance to ISIS, and they have created a mujahedeen council.
Anbar Province has a couple of towns, like Garma, with a patchwork of different insurgent groups, but ISIS dominates.
Other nationalist or tribal groups include the 1920 Revolution Brigades, while more Islamist groups include the Islamic Army of Iraq and the Mujahedeen Army.
