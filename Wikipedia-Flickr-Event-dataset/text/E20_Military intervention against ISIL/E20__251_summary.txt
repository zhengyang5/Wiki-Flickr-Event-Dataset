Iraqi forces have cleared Islamic State militants from the area surrounding the strategically important Haditha Dam and regained control of the nearby town of Barwana with the help of a series of US airstrikes.
Barwana, located southeast of Haditha in Anbar province, was retaken on Monday when Iraqi troops and pro-government Shiite militias routed Islamic State fighters, according to AFP.
State television had previously reported that the northern approach to Barwana was under government control and that 15 Islamic State militants had been killed.
"If Islamic State had gained control of the dam, many areas of Iraq would have been seriously threatened, even Baghdad."
Meanwhile, Iraqi lawmakers were attempting to cobble together an inclusive unity government in Baghdad to successfully take on the Islamic State.
