(EPA/TOLGA BOZOGLU)U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria killed eight civilians and wounded an additional three during a period between April 12 and July 4 last year, the Pentagon said in a statement Friday.
The release marks the third time the Pentagon has acknowledged civilian casualties since its air campaign against the Islamic State began in August 2014.
In December, the Pentagon said a number of Iraqi forces around Fallujah had been killed in a friendly fire incident.
In November 2015, CENTCOM said that an errant A-10 Warthog strike killed four civilians at a checkpoint in Iraq.
