If true, this means that the largest known United States non-nuclear bomb is a nanoweapon.
This begs a question:Does the United States MOAB use nanotechnology?
While it is true that the United States dropped its MOAB with an observable 11 ton TNT punch, it does not preclude that the United States has other non-nuclear bombs of even more destructive power.
Recall in the 1990 gulf war, the United States used some munitions that dated back to the 1960s.
Therefore, it is reasonable to believe the United States already has the capability to surpass Russia’s “father of all bombs.”Neither the Russians nor the United States explain exactly how these highly destructive non-nuclear bombs actually work.
