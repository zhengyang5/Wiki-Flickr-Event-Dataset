They blasted the United States for including Nusra on its target list.
Rebel fighters argue that they constitute the only friendly ground force available to the international coalition to fill the security vacuum in places that ISIS fighters are forced to abandon.
Congress mumThe United States has begun a bombing campaign in Syria, but don’t bet on Congress returning to Washington to vote on a new war authorization anytime soon.
Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., tweeted Monday night it was “irresponsible and immoral” that congressional leaders had chosen to recess for nearly two months instead of debating and voting on war.
