AUSTRALIAN forces fighting against terrorists in Iraq have helped reclaim more than 800 square km of territory from ISIS.
About 600 ADF troops have been deployed to the Middle East as part of operation OKRA — Australia’s contribution to the international fight against the Islamic State — since the mission began in September.
In the past month Australia’s air force dropped 45 laser-guided and GPS-guided bombs, targeting both Islamic State fighters and key logistics bases.
In a history-making 16-hour missions, the crew of Australia’s Wedgetail aircraft operating over Iraq set a new record for the longest Australian air mission in a war zone.
About 200 Air Task Group (ATG) personnel have now rotated back to Australia after a four month deployment.
