RAF Marham Station Commander Richard Davies has said he is "absolutely confident" that there will be no civilian casualties as air strikes were launched over Syria.

Following the vote strikes were swiftly carried out by two pairs of RAF GR4 Tornados from Akrotiri in Cyprus.

The Defence Secretary also announced six Typhoons would join the Tornados already stationed at the base.

The first two Typhoons are en-route to the island now having departed from the Scottish airbase RAF Lossiemouth.

It has played a key role in Operation Shader - the military intervention against (IS) in Iraq. Around 860 personnel are involved in the mission at RAF Akrotiri, according to the Ministry of Defence.
