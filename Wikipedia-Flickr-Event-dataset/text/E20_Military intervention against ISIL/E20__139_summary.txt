The US defence secretary has warned of a threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group in Afghanistan during an unannounced visit.
Meanwhile, US Army General John Campbell, who leads international forces in Afghanistan, said ISIL had coalesced over the last six months in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces.
He said their presence had forced the Taliban to re-direct some resources away from fighting Afghan security forces.

ISIL has seized large expanses of territory in Iraq and Syria and in recent months mounted attacks on Afghan security forces in Nangarhar.
