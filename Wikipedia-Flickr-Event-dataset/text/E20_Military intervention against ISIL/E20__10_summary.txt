French planes have carried out air strikes on Islamic State (Isis) targets in Iraq.
A statement from Hollande's office read: "This morning, at 9.40am, our Rafale aircraft carried out a first attack against a logistics centre of the terrorist organisation Daesh [Isis] in the north-east of Iraq.
The US president, Barack Obama, previously praised Hollande's decision to join the campaign against Isis, also called Isil.
As part of the air campaign France will join in strikes against Isil in Iraq," he said.
France has been conducting reconnaissance flights over Iraq since Monday and has dispatched weapons to Kurdish forces fighting Isis.
