The Nigerian Army is trying to root out Boko Haram from Sambisa Forest, a vast area of vegetation in the country's northeast.
The Nigerian Army rescued 160 women and children from Boko Haram on Thursday, and more could follow as troops trek further into Sambisa Forest, the Islamist militants' stronghold.
Since early February, Nigerian troops, alongside those of Chad, Niger, Benin, and Cameroon, have been slowly recapturing towns once overrun by Boko Haram in northeast Nigeria.
There were also reports of a suspected Boko Haram attack on 21 displaced civilians trying to return to their home in Yobe State.
Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria's incoming president and a former military general, has vowed that he will stamp out Boko Haram.
