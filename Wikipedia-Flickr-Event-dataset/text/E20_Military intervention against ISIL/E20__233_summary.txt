Australia has completed a second humanitarian aid drop to assist the people of Iraq.
A Royal Australian Air Force C-130J Hercules aircraft has delivered 15 bundles of Australian humanitarian supplies to isolated civilians in the Northern Iraqi town of Amirli.
It follows an Australian humanitarian aid drop on 14 August, which delivered nine tonnes of supplies to Yezidi civilians, trapped on Mount Sinjar in the country’s north.
The Australian Defence Force stands ready to provide further air-lift assistance to Iraq with the movement of stores including arms and munitions.
Australia’s contribution in Iraq will continue to be coordinated with the Iraqi government, regional countries and our international partners.
