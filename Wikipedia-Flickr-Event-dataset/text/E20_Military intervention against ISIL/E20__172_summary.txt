A Canadian soldier based in Petawawa, Ont., was killed by Iraqi Kurdish forces who "mistakenly engaged" in combat in Iraq, according to the Department of National Defence.
Andrew Joseph Doiron from the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, based at Garrison Petawawa, was killed on Friday around 3:50 p.m.
He is the first Canadian soldier killed during Canada's current mission to Iraq.
"Members of the Special Operations Forces were mistakenly engaged by Iraqi Kurdish forces following their return to an observation post behind the front lines," the release stated.
Canadian special forces have exchanged fire with ISIS at least three times since being deployed.
