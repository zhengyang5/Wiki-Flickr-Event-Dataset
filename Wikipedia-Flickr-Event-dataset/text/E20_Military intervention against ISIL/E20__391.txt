Evidence has emerged that British special forces have engaged in frontline combat against violent jihadists in Libya for the first time, destroying an Islamic State vehicle packed with explosives.

It follows reports earlier this year that elite commandos – including the SAS - were in Libya advising local forces in the fight against Isil.

Mohammed Durat, a commander of troops in Misrata, told The Times: “My unit works just with English. I have met with them personally and they have destroyed two suicide vehicles that were targeting my fighters.”
