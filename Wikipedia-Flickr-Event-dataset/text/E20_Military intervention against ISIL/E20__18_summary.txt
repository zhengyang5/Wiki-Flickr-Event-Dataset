Jordan executes two in response to pilot's slayingEarlier in the day, Jordan executed two jihadist prisoners by hanging in response to the killing of Kassasbeh, government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said.
The executions came just hours after IS militants released a video which showed al-Kassasbeh being burned alive in a cage.
The European Union, which had released a statement of solidarity with Jordan over the brutal killing of al-Kassasbeh, condemned the executions.
The YPG's political arm, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), vowed to avenge IS's killing of al-Kassasbeh and Japanese fellow captives Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa.
