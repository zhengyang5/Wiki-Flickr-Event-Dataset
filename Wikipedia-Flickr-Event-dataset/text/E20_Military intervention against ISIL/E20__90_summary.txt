The Pentagon has struggled to come up with specific cost figures for the Iraq and Syria operations.
The costs of the operations began at a much lower rate in June then escalated as airstrikes began in northern Iraq on August 8.
In late August, the Pentagon said the cost was an average of $7.5 million daily.
A coalition of about 40 nations is participating in the U.S.-led operations, including several Arab nations that are conducting airstrikes in Syria.
Several European nations are participating in the airstrikes in Iraq, but not in Syria.
