The head of the western-backed Free Syrian Army, the “official rebel force” fighting President Bashar al-Assad, has been sacked and replaced as the United States and its Middle East allies gear up to send in more arms.
Gen Selim Idriss, a defected former officer from the regime’s army, was voted out by other rebel commanders still loyal to the rump force.
His replacement is Brigadier Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir, currently leader of the FSA’s military council in Quneitra and south Damascus.
"The southern front is a major element of FSA strategy," said one adviser to the leadership of the opposition Syrian National Coalition.
Jordan has been exercising greater control over both fighters and weapons crossing its border with Syria than Turkey.
