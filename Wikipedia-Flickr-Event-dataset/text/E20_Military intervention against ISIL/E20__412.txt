A U.S. commando from Maryland has been killed in Afghanistan after being hit by a roadside bomb while on patrol with Afghan forces in a northeastern providence bordering Pakistan, the U.S. military says.

On Wednesday, the Department of Defense identified the soldier as Staff Sgt. Adam S. Thomas, 31, of Takoma Park, Maryland.

U.S. forces have been conducting counterterror operations with Afghan troops against Islamic State militants in Achin, Nangarhar province. The U.S. military says Thomas died from wounds sustained when a device exploded.

Thomas was assigned to Company B, 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort Carson, Colorado.

Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, says the U.S. remains committed to defeating the Islamic State Khorasan group, the IS affiliate in Afghanistan.

The U.S. has been conducting airstrikes near Achin. Last week Afghan officials said a U.S. airstrike hit a house, killing civilians.

The U.S. says it's looking into the incident.
