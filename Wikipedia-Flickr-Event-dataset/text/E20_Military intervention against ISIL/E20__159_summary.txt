The Pentagon confirmed Thursday that one U.S. service member was fatally wounded earlier in the day during an Iraq mission to rescue about 70 hostages from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the first U.S. combat death against the group.
The mission, carried out by U.S. Special Operations Forces, was in support of an Iraqi Peshmerga operation to rescue the hostages at an ISIS prison near Hawijah.
Approximately 70 hostages were rescued, including more than 20 members of the Iraqi Security Forces, Cook said.
He said the U.S. helicopters provided the air support for the operation, and U.S. forces accompanied Iraqi Peshmerga forces to the compound.
Cook also said the mission was authorized consistent with counter-ISIS efforts to train, advise and assist Iraqi forces.
