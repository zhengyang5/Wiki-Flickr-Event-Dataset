The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group now controls less than 7 percent of Iraq, down from the 40 percent it held nearly three years ago, an Iraqi military spokesman has said.
"As of March 31 [this year], they only held 6.8 percent of Iraqi territory," said Rasool, the spokesman of the Joint Operations Command coordinating the anti-ISIL effort.
Various members of the forces, Iraqi and foreign, battling ISIL have disagreed in the past on figures about control of territory, but ISIL has been losing ground steadily for close to two years.
"Once that task is accomplished, the coalition will be here to support our Iraqi partners as they eliminate ISIL from every corner of Iraq," Colonel John Dorrian said.
ISIL still controls the large towns of Hawijah and Tal Afar, as well as remote areas along the border with Syria in western Iraq.
