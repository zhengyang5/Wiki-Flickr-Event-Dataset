WASHINGTONâ€”The U.S. military began training a small group of Syrian rebels this week at a base in Jordan, the start of what U.S. defense officials said was an important step toward creating a force to eventually challenge Islamic State militants.
Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Thursday about 90 moderate rebels were being trained as part of the force, and officials said a second group would begin training shortly in Turkey.
