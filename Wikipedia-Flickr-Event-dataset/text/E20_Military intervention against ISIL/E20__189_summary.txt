But the Islamic State is not only making such gains in Iraq.
Just last night, the Islamic State added to its list of conquests by capturing the SAA's 93rd Brigade in Raqqa.
Taken together, the Islamic State's ongoing offensive and military gains in Iraq and Syria are extremely significant.
A continuing rebellion by the Sha'itat tribe in Deir ez Zour (renamed Wilayat Al-Khayr by the Islamic State) will draw resources in the coming days and possibly weeks, as the Islamic State seeks to consolidate its position in the east along the Euphrates and Khabur rivers.
That will prove a defining test for all concerned, with significant consequences for the future of the conflict and the Islamic State.
