This week high-ranking diplomats and military officials from around the world have been meeting to discuss the future of Iraq and the fight against the terrorist organization ISIS.
Sweden’s Minister of Defense Peter Hultqvist and Foreign Minister Margot Wallström participated in the meeting.
The US and coalition forces have requested more military support and Hultqvist officially announced Wednesday that Sweden plans to double its support in northern Iraq from 35 to 70 soldiers, pending a vote in parliament.
"I am glad that the government has decided to double our efforts in Iraq, but it's not enough," he told Radio Sweden.
To build a good future for the Middle East, they must be combated,” he told Swedish Radio.
