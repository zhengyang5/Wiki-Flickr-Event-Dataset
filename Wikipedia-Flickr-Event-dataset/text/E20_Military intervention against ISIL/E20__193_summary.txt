(CNN) Health workers scramble to pulled lifeless bodies out from under mounds of rubble after airstrikes reportedly hit and killed 82 civilians in the eastern part of the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor, a human rights groups said.
Three air attacks targeted heavily crowded areas, including a mosque during prayer time on Saturday, in the town of al-Quriyah, UNICEF said in a statement.
Deir Ezzor city, the provincial capital, has been a hotbed of conflict since ISIS militants captured the northern suburbs in January.
The city has been a critical junction for ISIS , with roads east and south toward Iraq and west to areas it controls in Homs province, including Palmyra.
"It is unclear whether these airstrikes were carried out by Russian or Syrian warplanes," Rami Abdul Rahman, the founder of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based organization that monitors the war in Syria, told CNN on Monday.
