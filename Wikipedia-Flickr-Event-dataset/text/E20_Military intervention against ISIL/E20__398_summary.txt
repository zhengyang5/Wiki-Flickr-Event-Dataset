Its first aim was to drive Afghan Taliban fighters out of the area and it also hoped to evict Taliban ally al-Qaeda from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, or absorb its fighters.
But it has largely been eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and military operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces.
US General John Nicholson, the top commander of US and Nato troops in Afghanistan, estimates that between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters are in Afghanistan.
It says it carried out some of the deadliest recent attacks in Afghanistan, several of them in the capital, Kabul.
These powers have established contacts with the Afghan Taliban, which is fighting IS, to hedge against the potential risk.
