Flies buzz around human remains poking through the dusty earth in the Iraqi town of Dhuluiyah, 90km north of Baghdad, at a hastily-dug pit containing the bodies of dozens of ISIS fighters killed in 2015.
Elsewhere, in western Iraq's Anbar province, the luckiest among the ISIS dead appear to be those killed during its offensives against the army in 2015.
In the centre of Fallujah, the first major city captured by the group in 2014, hundreds of memorials in a makeshift cemetery bear the noms de guerre of foreign fighters buried by their comrades.
As clashes rage with the militants, one Syrian commander said that what happens to dead fighters is not a priority.
In the desert plains that the militants once dominated, the bodies of dead fighters are left abandoned, a pro-regime militia head told AFP.
