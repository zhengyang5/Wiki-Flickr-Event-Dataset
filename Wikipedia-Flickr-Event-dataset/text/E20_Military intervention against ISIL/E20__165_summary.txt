ANKARA — Foreign suspects accused of killing three, including a police officer and a soldier in an attack at a security checkpoint in central Turkey last week were interrogated by Turkish prosecutors.
Çendrim Ramadani, Benjamin Xu and Muhammed Zakiri were captured by Turkish security forces after they shot a police officer, a military officer and a civilian dead at a checkpoint in the central Turkish province of Niğde last Thursday.
ISIL, which gained the upper hand against rebels of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in some parts of Syria threatened Turkey last week.
The splinter group of al-Qaeda surrounded a Turkish enclave where Turkish soldiers are deployed and gave the country a three-day-deadline to withdraw forces.
Six people were captured in the southern Turkish province of Kilis bordering with Syria two weeks ago as they attempted to cross into Syria to join ISIL.
