The Pentagon is estimating the cost of U.S. air operations in Iraq and Syria at about $7.6 million a day.
Defense officials also confirmed for the first time that AC-130 gunships made by Lockheed Martin Corp. have joined bombers such as the the B-1B and fighters such as the the F-16, F-15E and F/A-18 in attacking Islamic State targets in Iraq.
The use of the precision strike aircraft suggests that the U.S. doesnâ€™t think the Islamic State extremists have significant air-defense capabilities, at least in parts of Iraq.
Kobani StrikesThe strikes increased this week as U.S. aircraft, including B-1B bombers, attacked Islamic State targets near the besieged Kurdish town of Kobani in Syria.
Pentagon budget analysts are preparing an amendment to the proposed $58.6 billion war budget for the current fiscal year to include added expenditures for the fight against Islamic State, according to a defense official.
