The 22nd MEU, embarked on Wasp, is conducting precision airstrikes in support of the Libyan Government of National Accord-aligned forces against Islamic State targets in Sirte, Libya, as part of Operation Odyssey Lightning.
The pace of U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State group fighters in Libya slowed in September as the number of insurgents holed up in a hard-to-target section of the coastal city of Sirte shrinks.
So far this month, U.S. forces have conducted 50 airstrikes against Islamic State targets, compared with 108 in August, according to a tally of U.S. Africa Command-led strikes.
Shortly before U.S. operations, the military estimated that several thousand militants were positioned in the city, a burgeoning stronghold for the Islamic State in Libya.
During the past year, the Islamic State has sought to make inroads, taking advantage of the anarchy.
