Last week's capture by militants from the Al-Qaeda-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) of key Iraqi Sunni cities, coupled with the quick collapse of the Iraqi army has prompted Hezbollah to establish a military operations room to cope with the fast-moving dramatic developments in Iraq, Lebanese political sources said.
The sources disclosed that efforts were underway to revive the Mujahedeen Shura Council in Iraq, which comprises the Muslim Ulema Association and the Al-Qaeda organization in Iraq, along with the Iraqi Islamic Army which includes Saddam Hussein's remaining officers, in the face of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Shiite blocs.
Being a secretive party, Hezbollah command is now assessing the military situation in Iraq before taking any decisions.
However, the most important repercussion of the events in Iraq on Hezbollah is the intermingling military developments between Iraq and Syria, especially since ISIS and its allies have been trying to control large areas containing a huge wealth of oil and natural resources.
The events in Iraq come amid speculation pointing to the sudden collapse of an American-Iranian understanding in Iraq.
