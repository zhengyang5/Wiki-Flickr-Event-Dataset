Afri reportedly became Baghdadi's right-hand man after Baghdadi took a step back from decision-making for security reasons, Newsweek reports.
Osama bin Laden reportedly tapped Afri to run Al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS' predecessor, after the death of senior officials in 2010, according to Newsweek.
The Washington Post reported earlier this month that nearly all of ISIS' leaders were former Iraqi officers, not foreign fighters.
ISIS' leaders operate largely in the shadows.
Since rising to power as the leader of ISIS, Baghdadi has rarely appeared on video, and few photos of him have been released.
