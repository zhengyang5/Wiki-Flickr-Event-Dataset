Operation NABERIUS is a military training mission in Niger. Under this mission, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) is training the Forces armées nigériennes (FAN).

Global Affairs Canada’s (GAC) Counter-Terrorism Capacity Building Program (CTCBP) is funding this training.

Through this mission, the CAF is helping Canada’s ongoing work to build the Nigerien military and security forces’ capacity. Doing so helps Niger to counter terrorist organizations in the Sahel region.

The CAF training consists of two- or three-month serials. Here are some examples of what a serial could cover:

individual soldier skills

marksmanship

combat first aid

patrolling

checkpoint procedures

Each serial also includes leadership training. Themes include:

laws of armed conflict

operational planning

human rights law

gender equality and perspectives

protection of vulnerable populations

The CAF is teaching these serials to the FAN twice per year until March 31, 2020.

Operation NABERIUS is not part of any peace support operation.

Task Force NABERIUS

The CAF sends a training team of about 24 members to Niger twice per year. The team is known as Task Force NABERIUS. These members are from the Canadian Army.

Mission context

The CAF has been training the FAN since 2013. At that time, the CAF sent Canadian Special Operations Forces members to Niger. There they supported GAC’s Counter-Terrorism Capacity Building Program (CTCBP). In 2016, the Canadian Joint Operations Command took over the mission from the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command.

The GAC CTCBP was created in 2005. Its mandate is to enable countries to prevent and respond to terrorist activity through:

training;

funding;

equipment; and

technical and legal assistance.
