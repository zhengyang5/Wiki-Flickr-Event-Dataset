A file picture taken on Oct. 27, 2013, shows a Russian soldier guarding an Su-25 ground attack aircraft.
The country has a mixture of 28 ground-attack aircraft and multi-role fighters stationed in Syria and recently began flying large fixed-wing drones over the country.
Russia has longstanding ties with President Bashar al-Assad’s government and has maintained a warm-water docking area in Tartus.
The 24 Fencers and Frogfoots provide some indication of what type of operations Russia could conduct out of its revamped airfield: close air support.
Both Fencers and Frogfoots are jets that fly “low and slow,” much like the United States’ vaunted A-10 Thunderbolt.
