The decision became official Tuesday night when Conservative MPs voted in favour of Canada joining the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
The CF-18s are expected to come from CFB Cold Lake in Alberta and the Polaris refuelling aircraft from CFB Trenton.
Postmedia News is reporting that Canadian military officials are in discussions with Kuwait to base the CF-18s and other aircraft there.
Kuwait served as a staging area for Canadian military operations in Afghanistan during the latter years of Canadaâ€™s involvement there.
The Canadian military fought the Taliban in Afghanistan between 2005-2011, and participated in a NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya in 2011.
