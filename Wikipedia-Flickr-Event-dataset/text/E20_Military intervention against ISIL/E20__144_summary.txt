On Thursday, the Syrian Air Defenses detected a reconnaissance drone that belonged to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS), flying above their positions at the Kuweries Military Airbase before the soldiers were ordered to down the unmanned aircraft at this desert base in southeast Aleppo.
According to a military source, the drone was detected immediately by the observant soldiers; this unmanned aircraft was believed to have originated in the ISIS-held town of Deir Hafer, where the militants are headquartered in the Aleppo Governorate of Syria.
This downed drone is now the fifth reconnaissance unmanned aircraft to be caught spying on the Syrian Armed Forces at Kuweires Military Airbase over the last two weeks; this will not likely be the last drone to capture footage of the SAAâ€™s positions at the base, as ISIS has made it clear that they intend on capturing Kuweries Airbase.
The Syrian Arab Army inside of the Kuweires Military Airbase has repelled a number of ISIS attacks over the last two weeks, killing over 130 enemy combatants and destroying a multitude of armored vehicles that were mounted with a variety of anti-aircraft machine guns to protect themselves against the flurry of airstrikes launched by the Syrian Arab Air Force (SAAF).
