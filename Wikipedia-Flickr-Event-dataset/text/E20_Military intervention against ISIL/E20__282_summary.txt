Every president, along with the people who work for him, will tell you that they barely ever think about politics and public relations.
Even in the most serious matters, like making war, appearances are never far from their minds.
The idea of naming military operations began in World War I, but initially they were secret code names, intended to conceal rather than to boast.
Winston Churchill was very concerned with the code names of military operations in World War II, and advised in one 1943 memo, "Operations in which large numbers of men may lose their lives ought not to be described by code words which imply a boastful or overconfident sentiment."
After World War II, the names of operations became more descriptive, since they were no longer classified.
