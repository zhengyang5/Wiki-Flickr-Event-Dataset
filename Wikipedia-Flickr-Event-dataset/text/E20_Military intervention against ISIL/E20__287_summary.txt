Deadly Australian air strikes dent IS morale in Iraq: Rear Admiral David JohnstonUpdatedAustralian Super Hornets have increased their sorties over Iraq in the past week to allow the US and other coalition forces to concentrate their air strikes around the Syrian city of Kobane.
Chief of Joint Operations Rear Admiral David Johnston told a briefing in Canberra the Australian jets had now flown 43 sorties since combat operations began.
Rear Admiral Johnston confirmed a number of IS fighters had been killed in the missions, but refused to specify exactly how many.
He said the Australian strikes had had a significant impact on IS morale, undermining the group's notion of invulnerability.
Rear Admiral Johnston described the situation in Kobane as serious and said IS fighters had made significant advances in recent days.
