Three Saudi border guards have been killed and three others wounded in attack near the kingdom's frontier with Iraq, the interior ministry has said.
Rare assaultThe Saudi interior ministry reported initially that only two border guards and two assailants died in Monday's attack.
The ministry's spokesman told SPA that the guards had been patrolling the Saudi frontier at around 04:30 (01:30 GMT) when they intercepted the four men trying to enter from Iraq.
The ministry spokesman said the commander of the border force in the area, Brig Gen Oudah al-Balawi, was among the guards who were killed.
Saudi Arabia's heavily-defended 1,200km (745-mile) border with Iraq has come under mortar fire on previous occasions, but more direct assaults are rare.
