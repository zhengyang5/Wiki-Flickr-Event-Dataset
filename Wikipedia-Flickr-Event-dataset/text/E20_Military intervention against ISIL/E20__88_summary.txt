The US military says it has airdropped weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to Kurdish forces defending the Syrian city of Kobani against Islamic State militants.
The air drops on Sunday were the first of their kind and followed weeks of US and coalition air strikes in and near Kobani, near the Turkish border.
The US earlier said it had launched 11 air strikes overnight in the Kobani area.
Meanwhile Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday that Turkey was facilitating the passage of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters to Kobani.
In a written statement, Central Command said its forces had conducted more than 135 air strikes against Islamic State forces in Kobani.
