The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group is losing ground in Iraq and Syria, but Libya may be the group's next key battleground, according to a UN report obtained by Al Jazeera.
Several Libyan militia forces, backed by British and French special forces, have managed to push the group back into Sirte.
But the Western role has been kept secret from the public.
A key British MP has accused his government of misleading the public over the British role in Libya.
According to the findings, there have been military setbacks for ISIL in Syria and Iraq, two countries where it has seized territory.
