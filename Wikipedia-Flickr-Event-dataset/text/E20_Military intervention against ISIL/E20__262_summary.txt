iStock/Thinkstock(NEW YORK) -- The U.S. mission in Iraq to find a quick solution to the onslaught of Islamic extremists has been compromised by the infiltration of Sunni and Shiite radicals into the national army.
According to a story in The New York Times, the lives of American military personnel would be in danger if they attempt to advise Iraqi forces because of spies either affiliated with Sunnis attempting to overthrow the government or Shiite militiamen with ties to Iran.
Adding to the quandary faced by the White House and the Pentagon is the growing reliance of the national army on Iran, which has either trained Shiite militias or supplied advisers from its vaunted paramilitary Quds Force.
Should the U.S. back off on direct military help, the Times said, Baghdadâ€™s dependence on Tehran may not be enough alone to defeat the Islamic State.
