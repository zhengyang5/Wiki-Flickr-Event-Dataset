The Iranian Air Force is bombing Islamic State (ISIS) targets inside Iraqi territory.
The first footage of an Iranian aircraft bombing inside Iraq was broadcast by Al Jazeera a few days ago in a report on a joint operation by the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, Iraq's army and Shia militias to recapture two Kurdish towns in northeastern Iraq, near the Iranian border.
The report mentions "Iraqi jet-fighters," but the plane seen bombing ISIS positions is a F-4 Phantom, which is not in Iraqi service.
They wouldn't be risking these in American-dominated airspace if they hadn't received assurances that they were liable to be shot down.
The Phantom captured by an Al Jazeera camera crew is proof that coordination between the two sides is going at some level.
