BEIRUT // Hizbollah has declared war on ISIL after the extremists launched an offensive on its positions inside Lebanon this week.
“The battle with ISIL has begun,” Hizbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah declared on Wednesday, vowing to erase the threat ISIL posed to Lebanon and blaming the extremist group for starting the fight.
His televised address came a day after ISIL fighters attacked a Hizbollah position outside the Bekaa Valley border town of Ras Baalbek in Lebanon’s north-east.
As the Nusra-led Jaysh Al Fatah rebel coalition was battling Hizbollah on the border, the alliance also declared war on ISIL in the region last month.
“The ISIL threat is serious to Lebanon but the Lebanese Sunni social structure is totally, strongly against ISIL,” he said.
