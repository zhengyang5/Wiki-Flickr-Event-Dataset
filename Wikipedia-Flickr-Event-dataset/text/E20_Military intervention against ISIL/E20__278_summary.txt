REUTERS/Abdalghne Karoof So far, the military operations against the group Islamic State (also known as ISIL and ISIS) and other jihadists in Syria and Iraq that are being led by US Central Command have not been given a name.
In fact, in a conversation with Business Insider on Wednesday, Fallon said CENTCOM was probably using a name for the operations internally.
However, shortly after Business Insider spoke to Fallon, CENTCOM spokesman Major Curtis Kellogg insisted the operations against ISIS remained unnamed.
"There is no legal significance in the naming of operations, nor does it affect legal authority," the spokesperson said.
According to a CENTCOM spokesperson, names for operations led by the command would be conceived by a "group" within CENTCOM.
