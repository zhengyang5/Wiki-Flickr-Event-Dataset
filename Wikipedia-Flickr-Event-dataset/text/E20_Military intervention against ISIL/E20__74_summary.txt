Ahrar al-Sham, a Syrian rebel group, has announced its new leadership after it lost its top brass during a bomb attack on a high-level meeting in Idlib province.
It pledged to keep fighting against Syrian government forces and the Islamic State armed group, Reuters news agency said.
It is not known who staged the attack but Islamic State sympathisers hailed the death of Abboud on social media.
Another of Ahrar's leaders, Abu Khaled al-Souri, a close associate with al-Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, was killed by the Islamic State earlier this year.
That assassination caused the schism that pitted the Islamic State against other rebel factions in Syria.
