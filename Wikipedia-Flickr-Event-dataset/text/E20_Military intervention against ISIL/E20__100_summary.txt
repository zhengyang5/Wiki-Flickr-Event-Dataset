It comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott talked down involvement saying there was no 'boots on the ground' role planned for Australian forces in the multinational effort.
'This is about what is right for our country and what is best for our world,' Mr Abbott said on Sunday.
Mr Abbott said he agreed to join the US-led effort and Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop to northern Iraq.
Greens leader Christine Milne sided with Mr Wilkie, urging Mr Abbott to put Australia's involvement in Iraq at the top of the list for discussion in parliament on Monday.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott responded to the request from the Obama Administration 'Australia will join international partners to help the anti-ISIL forces in Iraq,' said Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured).
