The 22nd MEU, embarked on Wasp, is conducting precision air strikes in support of the Libyan Government of National Accord-aligned forces against Islamic State targets in Sirte, Libya.
AFRICOM is targeting an increasingly small area in the coastal city of Sirte, which is the focus of the U.S. mission in Libya.
A few months ago, Islamic State fighters were in control of large parts of the city, where several thousand fighters were holed up.
Last month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Islamic State fighters had been pushed into a single neighborhood in Sirte.
The U.S. decision to conduct strikes in Libya came after months of deliberations and a formal request for support from the Libyan government.
