A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the directive is classified, said the government considers the underlying legal authority to be unchanged.
The change does not affect targeting procedures in other places like Libya where the Islamic State has a growing presence, the official said.
In 2013, after a dispute over tactics with Osama bin Laden’s successor as the leader of the original Al Qaeda, based in Pakistan, the Islamic State split from Al Qaeda and rebranded itself.
Separately, the State Department last week designated the Islamic State’s affiliate in Afghanistan a foreign terrorist group, subjecting it to sanctions.
The senior administration official said the timing was a coincidence.
