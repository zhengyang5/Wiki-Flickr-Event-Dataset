I’ve said before, the United States cannot and should not intervene every time there’s a crisis in the world.
I know that many of you are rightly concerned about any American military action in Iraq, even limited strikes like these.

Iraqis have named a new President, a new Speaker of Parliament, and are seeking consensus on a new Prime Minister.
God bless our Armed Forces, and God bless the United States of America.
