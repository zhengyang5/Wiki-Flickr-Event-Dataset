LONDON — Warplanes from Iran launched airstrikes against ISIS fighters outside Baghdad last week, senior U.S. military officials told NBC News on Wednesday.
The officials stressed that the strikes were in an area far from where the United States and its coalition partners have been targeting ISIS.
If Iran is taking on ISIS with limited strikes, “the net effect is positive, but that’s not something that we’re coordinating,” he said.
A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said Tuesday that U.S. officials had "no indication that the reports are not true."
