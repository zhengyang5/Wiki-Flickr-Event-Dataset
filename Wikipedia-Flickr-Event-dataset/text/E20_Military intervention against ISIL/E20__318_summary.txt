Canada's top general says he didn't foresee that Canadian special forces troops would be directing air strikes in Iraq when he publicly ruled out this role during interviews last fall.
Canada's special forces soldiers, who are armed, spend 20 per cent of their time near the front lines but are not looking for a fight.
Last fall, he told CTV News that soldiers would not be guiding air strikes from the ground in Iraq but would stick to training Kurdish peshmerga.
He said it turned out that Canadian soldiers can direct air strikes from relative safety in Iraq.
He said Canadians will continue directing air strikes from the ground and firing back if attacked.
