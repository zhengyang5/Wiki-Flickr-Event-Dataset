Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed caliph of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been wounded in an airstrike in Iraq’s northwestern town of al-Qa’im along the border with Syria, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi told the pan-Arab Al-Hayat newspaper on Tuesday.
“His survival was a miracle,” said Abadi, adding that Baghdadi has since “moved to another location.”The ISIS leader is “sometimes present in Mosul, but most of the time he’s in Syria, not Iraq,” the prime minster said.
ISIS has turned its sights on Kurdistan after realizing that it could not reach southern Iraq, the prime minister added.
Relations with Turkey are strained because Ankara considers the Kurdistan Workers’ Party as much a threat as ISIS, if not more, Abadi said.
I think he’s in another country,” the prime minister said.
