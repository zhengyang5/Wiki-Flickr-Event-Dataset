The Council of Ministers in the Netherlands has committed military personnel to the international fight against Islamic State (ISIS).
"For military operations in Syria, there is currently no international agreement on an internationally legal mandate," Asscher told reporters.
Minister Hennis told reporters that the F-16 fighter aircrafts which will be used to carry out military actions in Iraq, are to be prepared at a location outside Iraq.
A total of 380 Dutch soldiers will be stationed in Iraq: 250 for the management of the F-16s, and 130 trainers.
The United States led formation of the international coalition fighting ISIS.
