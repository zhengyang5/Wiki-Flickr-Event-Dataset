Closer to home, U.S.-ally the Philippines has also seen a surge in violence from extremist groups on the islands of Mindanao, Sulu and Basilan. In May, the militant group Abu Sayyaf, which pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014, released a video of the beheading of Canadian citizen John Ridsdel, which was followed by a beheading video in June of a second Canadian hostage, Robert Hall, after the group did not receive ransom for the men.
