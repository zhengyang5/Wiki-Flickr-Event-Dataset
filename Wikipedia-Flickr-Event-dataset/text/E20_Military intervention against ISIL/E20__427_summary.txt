U.S. Central Command's Gen. Lloyd Austin told Congress Tuesday that more than 8,500 ISIS fighters had been killed in the U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria.
As a result of U.S. and coalition airstrikes, and recent gains by Iraqi and Kurdish forces, ISIS "has assumed a defensive crouch" in Iraq.
The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was also on the defensive in Syria, Austin said in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee.
The campaign "has killed more than 8,500 ISIL fighters," Austin said, using another acronym for the terror group, and also disrupted ISIS' ability to maneuver and exercise command and control.
Despite the progress against ISIS, Austin said that the Middle East region remained "more chaotic than I have seen it at any point."
