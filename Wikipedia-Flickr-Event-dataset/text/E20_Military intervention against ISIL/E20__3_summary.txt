TONY JONES, PRESENTER: In coming days, the Australian Air Force could well be dropping bombs in Syria after federal cabinet today gave the go-ahead to expand air strikes from its current operations in Iraq.
The Government insists this is not about regime change in Syria, but rather defending Iraq from the scourge of Islamic State.
JASON OM, REPORTER: It's been almost 12 months since the first bombs aimed at Islamic State dropped on Iraq.
TONY ABBOTT, PRIME MINISTER: We cannot defeat Daesh in Iraq without defeating Daesh in Syria too.
JASON OM: Andrew Wilkie says that without an invitation from the Syrian Government as with Iraq or UN backing, the air strikes are illegal.
