Card 12 of 18Iran is fighting on the Iraqi governmentâ€™s sideThe Iranian government is Shia, and it has close ties with the Iraqi government.
First, and perhaps most importantly, Iran is the big backer behind Iraq's Shia militias, a major force in the battle against ISIS.
Iran arms many of the groups; Qassem Suleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, is often said to be leading the overall militia strategy.
That's a little hard to believe given Suleimani's role in the conflict: It's very hard to imagine the leader of the Quds Force is traveling without any accompaniment from Quds Force soldiers.
That puts the United States in an awkward position of tacitly working with Iran against ISIS while nominally attempting to limit Iranian influence.
