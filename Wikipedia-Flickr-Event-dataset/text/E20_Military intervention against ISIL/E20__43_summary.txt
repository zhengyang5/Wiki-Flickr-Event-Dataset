After all, it has been starkly clear since the summer of 2014 that Idlib in particular represents Jabhat al-Nusra’s most valuable powerbase.
This presented an existential challenge to Jabhat al-Nusra and to its overarching al Qaeda central leadership in Pakistan.
“Abu Mariya is considered [to be] within Jabhat al-Nusra’s internal opposition, but he’s actually a little isolated,” claimed one senior Salafist.
However, the re-moderation has been a divisive move and conservative elements within Jabhat al-Nusra are allegedly increasingly discontent.
If for that reason only, the international community must view Jabhat al-Nusra’s cunning positioning as part of a long-term plan.
