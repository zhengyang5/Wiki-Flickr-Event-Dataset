But this video had something else in it that previous videos released by ISIS have not: Surveillance footage apparently shot by a drone.
Armed drones have been deployed in combat by only three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel.
Russia, China and Iran are among the nations that possess armed drones but haven't used them in combatThat terrorist and militant organizations have acquired and used drones during combat operations for surveillance purposes shows how rapidly this technology is proliferating.
This is why it is crucial to have some kind of international agreement that governs the use of armed drones by both states and "nonstate actors."
One could imagine the creation of some kind of Geneva Convention that specifies as a matter of international law when the use of armed drones could be sanctioned outside of conventional war zones to kill terrorists.
