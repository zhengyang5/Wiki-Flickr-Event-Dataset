US fighter jets struck the IS base near Tripoli early on Friday, killing about 40 people, officials have said.
The US raid came just hours after a senior EU official cast doubt on the possibility of military intervention in Libya, stressing the need for an internal political solution.
However, Kerchove said the EU was "not qualified" to assess the need for international intervention in Libya, as it is not considered a military force.
Amid years of unrest, Islamic State has established a firm foothold in Libya, last month leading a coordinated assault on two of the country's main oil ports.
Wolfgang Pusztai, an independent analyst specialising in Libya, told MEE last week that “intervention to stop the expansion of IS is not a ‘war of choice’ but a matter of necessity".
