The Al-Qaeda deputy leader, Abu Khayr al Masri, has reportedly been killed in a drone strike in Syriaâ€™s Idlib governorate.
The U.S drone strike targeted the leader at Al-Mastoumeh in Idlib, neutralizing him immediately.
This will prove to be a devastating blow to the terrorist group, and it is not immediately clear who will replace the notorious leader.
In recent months, the US-led coalition have been conducting drone and airstrikes against terrorist targets in Idlib governorate.
