Al-Qaida Reasserts Itself With Khorasan GroupEnlarge this image toggle caption Fadi al-Halabi/AFP/Getty Images Fadi al-Halabi/AFP/Getty ImagesOne of the first targets of U.S. airstrikes in Syria was an al-Qaida unit that American officials call the Khorasan Group.
"The real importance of the Khorasan Group is that it challenges the conventional wisdom that al-Qaida Core, the al-Qaida senior leadership, has been so degraded as to be inconsequential," Hoffman said.
Training camps, explosives facilities and other operational targets were destroyed, but it is unclear how many — and who — from the Khorasan Group were killed.
U.S. officials say Khorasan is more sophisticated than a simple al-Qaida affiliate.
Zawahiri sent the group to Syria to set up a beachhead for al-Qaida Core recruiting, as well.
