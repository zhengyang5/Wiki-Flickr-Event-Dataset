The authority to create the names is spread across 24 Defense Department agencies and commands, but Kirby suggested that what is happening in Iraq now could be a no-name operation indefinitely.
Leaving the operation nameless would be a break with a U.S. military tradition stretching back to World War II.
After much deliberation, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan became "Operation Iraqi Freedom" and "Operation Enduring Freedom," and those operations generated hundreds of subsets of operational names for particular engagements.
Churchill also intervened in the naming of the most famous allied operation of World War II -- the D-Day invasion of Normandy.
Then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later announced that the military's actions in Afghanistan would be called "Operation Enduring Freedom."
