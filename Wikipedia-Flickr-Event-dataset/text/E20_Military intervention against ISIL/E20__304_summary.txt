Noble Lords: My Lordsâ€”The Lord Privy Seal (Baroness Stowell of Beeston) (Con): My Lords, I have only just arrived.

I think we should all be very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Davies, for having given us a very rare picture of what life is like in Damascus now.
Here I endorse the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Wright, and the noble Lord, Lord Davies.
This is not about military action against Assad; it is about military action against ISIL.
