Daesh

Daesh was formed in Iraq in October 2004. The leader of a group known as Jamaat al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, aligned with Al-Qaeda. This created what was then known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group has also been known as:

the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)

the Islamic State (IS)

the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)

Daesh advocates radical interpretations of Islam. It also claims religious authority over all Muslims. It aims to create a caliphate in the Levant region. This area includes:

Iraq

Syria

Jordan

Israel

the West Bank and Gaza

Lebanon

Cyprus

a part of southern Turkey

Daesh aims to achieve its goals by converting or killing non-Sunni populations. Its ultimate objective is to establish a world-wide Islamic caliphate.

The group began taking control of territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014. It started with Fallujah in Iraq in January 2014. It ended with the fall of Mosul in June 2014. Its rapid advance across Iraq and Syria has:

displaced millions of people and caused the death of thousands

undermined stability in Iraq and the region

posed a threat to international security

Daesh has fighters across Iraq and Syria. A number of these are foreign recruits.

International response

The United States President authorized targeted military intervention in Iraq on August 7, 2014. Canada joined the United States-led Coalition in the summer of 2014 to dismantle and ultimately defeat Daesh. The Coalition includes many of Canada’s closest allies and partners. It also includes important regional partners.

The Global Coalition has been effective. Daesh is on the defensive and is losing control of the territory it once held. Despite the significant progress that has been made in Iraq and Syria, the fight against Daesh will take time. The Canadian Armed Forces remains committed to the Global Coalition efforts towards a lasting defeat of Daesh.
