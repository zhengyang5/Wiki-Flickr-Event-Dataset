Ya'alon says intel is Israel's 'contribution' to campaign against jihadi group, notes Jerusalem 'has enough problems' in any case.
Israel has been providing the international coalition to defeat Islamic State (ISIS) with intelligence, Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon confirmed Monday - but has no intention of physically joining the campaign.
Ya'alon revealed Israel's involvement during an interview with PBS's Charlie Rose.
Ya'alon deflected the idea that Israel would join the coalition itself, however.
"By having this bilateral relationship - sharing intelligence, and so forth - this is our contribution to the operation," he added.
