The storm itself was moving slowly at just 6 mph. That meant the same area of water was being hit over and over by the winds — the perfect conditions for building monster waves.

As Joaquin slowed and strengthened, the El Faro was in trouble. The crew reported on Oct. 1 that the ship — which had two auxiliary power generators — had lost power, was taking on water and was listing at 15 degrees.

That was the last contact made with the ship. At the time, the center of Joaquin was about 175 miles out and maximum sustained winds had hit 120 mph. Overnight, they were howling at 130 mph and moving ever nearer to the El Faro's last known position.

"If the vessel did sink on Thursday, and that crew was able to abandon ship they would have been abandoning ship in a Category 4 hurricane," Fedor said. "Those are challenging conditions to survive."

He pointed out, however, that the crew of the El Faro were trained mariners, saying, "We’re not going to discount somebody's will to survive."

"As the search for the El Faro mariners continues, our thoughts and prayers remain with them and their families," said Michael Sacco, the president of the Seafarers International Union, which represents American merchant mariners. “In this age when we are all accustomed to instant information and quick answers, it has been an agonizing wait these last few days."

Tim Nolan, president of TOTE Maritime, which owns the ship, said the "the entire TOTE Maritime Puerto Rico family is distressed that it now appears the El Faro sank at or near its last known position."

"We continue to hold out hope for survivors," he said. There were 28 Americans on board. At least five have been identified.
