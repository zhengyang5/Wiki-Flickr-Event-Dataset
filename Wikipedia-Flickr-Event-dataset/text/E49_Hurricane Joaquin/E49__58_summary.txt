RESIDENTS of Long Island, among the hardest hit southern Bahamas islands by Hurricane Joaquin, have described the Category 4 storm as “the worst we’ve ever seen”.
Loretta Butler-Turner, the Long Island MP, said the storm could not have hit her constituents “much harder”.
Revealing that she lost communications with Long Island at 1.30am on Friday, Mrs Butler-Turner said members of its Disaster Preparedness Committee had spent the previous night rescuing islanders from damaged or destroyed buildings.
“The individuals I’ve spoken to have said this is the worst they’ve ever seen it, with 100 mile per hour-plus winds.
Craig Gomez, president of the Bahamas Red Cross, said it was “moving expeditiously to provide assistance” to the islands worst hit by Joaquin.
