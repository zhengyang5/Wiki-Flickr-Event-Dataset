A BEC official on Crooked Island has estimated that some 10,000 gallons of fuel may have spilled when Hurricane Joaquin dislodged two 25,000-gallon tanks as it churned through the island.
If you walk in the area you wouldn’t see or smell any of the diesel for the amount that was lost,” Mr Daxon said.
Last week, Mr Miller said: “There was some leakage during the hurricane, but we disconnected those (tanks) and we already scraped out the fuel.
Meanwhile, more than three weeks after the passage of Hurricane Joaquin, flooding throughout Crooked Island remains a big issue.
Inland flooding has caused a major transportation problem for persons on the island, creating difficulty reaching various settlements.
