Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today urged residents to begin preparing their homes and families for heavy rains and potential flooding and the possible arrival of Hurricane Joaquin later this week.
Another possible round of rain this weekend from Hurricane Joaquin will increase the potential for widespread flash flooding and minor coastal flooding.
A flash flood “warning” means flash flooding or flooding has been reported or is imminent.
Identify an out-of-town friend or family member to be the “emergency family contact” and make sure all family members know that number.
Designate a family emergency meeting point – a familiar location where the family can meet in case the home is inaccessible.
