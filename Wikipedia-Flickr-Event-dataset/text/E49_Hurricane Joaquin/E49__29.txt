DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK ------------------------------ At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Joaquin was located by a reconnaissance plane near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 72.5 West. Joaquin is moving toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue through tonight with an increase in forward speed. A turn toward the north-northeast is forecast on Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Joaquin will continue to move away from the Bahamas today, and pass west of Bermuda on Sunday. Maximum sustained winds remain near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher gusts. Joaquin is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Slow weakening is forecast to begin later today, followed by steadier weakening Sunday and Sunday night. Hurricane force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from the center and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km). The minimum central pressure just reported by an Air Force reconnaissance plane was 940 mb (27.76 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- WIND: Gusty winds will continue to affect portions of the central and southeastern Bahamas this morning. Tropical storm conditions are first expected to reach Bermuda by Sunday morning, with hurricane conditions possible by Sunday afternoon. STORM SURGE: Water levels should slowly subside today as Joaquin moves away from the Bahamas. RAINFALL: Joaquin is expected to produce additional rain accumulations of 2 to 5 inches over the Bahamas, eastern Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the Turks and Caicos Islands through today. Isolated maximum storm-total amounts of 25 inches are possible in the central Bahamas. Outer rain bands of Joaquin will begin to affect Bermuda by early Sunday, and Joaquin is expected to produce 3 to 5 inches of rainfall over Bermuda through Monday. This rainfall could result in life-threatening flash floods. SURF: Swells generated by Joaquin will continue to affect portions of the Bahamas during the next few days. Swells are affecting much of the southeastern coast of the United States and will spread northward along the east coast of the United States through the weekend. Swells from Joaquin will begin affecting Bermuda today and continue through the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Even though Joaquin is expected to pass well east of the coast of the United States, a prolonged period of elevated water levels and large waves will affect the mid-Atlantic region, causing significant beach and dune erosion with moderate coastal flooding likely.
