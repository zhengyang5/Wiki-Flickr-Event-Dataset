DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK ------------------------------ At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Joaquin was located near latitude 42.0 North, longitude 37.0 West. The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east near 35 mph (56 km/h), and this general motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours. Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km) from the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- WIND: Gale-force winds associated with the post-tropical cyclone are expected to spread over portions of the Azores on Thursday. SURF: Swells generated by Joaquin will continue to affect Atlantic Canada during the next day or so. Swells affecting much of the eastern coast of the United States are now mostly associated with a non-tropical area of low pressure over the western Atlantic, and these swells are expected to continue for the next day or two. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely in association with these swells. Please consult products from your local weather office.
