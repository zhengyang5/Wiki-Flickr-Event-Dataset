Hurricane Joaquin began slowly moving away from the Bahamas early Saturday morning, finally easing a two-day long assault that flooded and destroyed home and left a 735-foot cargo ship missing.
The latest track forecast also continued to keep Joaquin far from the U.S. coast but put Bermuda more at risk.
The Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch for Bermuda.
A tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area.
For Bermuda, the tropical storm conditions are expected within the next 36 hours.
