The Royal Bermuda Regiment [RBR] tonight [Oct 2] are gearing up in case Hurricane Joaquin hits the Island on Sunday.

Equipment will tomorrow morning be stationed east of the Causeway in case the east end is cut off and up to 120 troops are on 12 hours notice to deploy.

RBR Commanding Officer Lt Col Michael Foster-Brown said: “We are hoping these preparations and precautions won’t be required – but if they are we will be ready.”

Col Foster-Brown added that, if needed, troop deployments would involve Immediate Response Teams on land and on the water and support soldiers like chefs, drivers and signallers.

He said: “We take our hurricane preparedness very seriously.

“We had the experience of Fay and Gonzalo last October in quick succession and we have refined our response even further as a result of that 10 day deployment.

“We have been in close contact with the Bermuda Weather Service (BWS) and have now reduced our notice to move from 24 hours to 12 hours.”

Col Foster-Brown added: “If pre-embodied, it will likely be a partial embodiment initially, focusing on our main role of opening access routes for emergency services.”

And he said soldiers should follow the messages on http://www.bermudaregiment.bm/ and from their company – particularly if the BWS formally declare a Hurricane Watch.

Col Foster-Brown added the Regt had been asked to be prepared to provide up to 17 soldiers to help residential care homes ride out the hurricane if it comes.

He said: “This task an extension of a similar successful one over Gonzalo.”

The 6.00pm advisory from the Bermuda Weather Service said the “closest point of approach to Bermuda within 72 hrs [3 days] is forecast to be 178 nm to the WNW, 10 pm Sun, Oct 4, 2015.”
