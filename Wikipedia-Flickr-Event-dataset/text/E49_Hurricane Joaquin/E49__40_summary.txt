Copyright by WNCT - All rights reservedWNCT Staff - SWAN QUARTER, N.C. (WNCT) - A mandatory evacuation order has been issued for Ocracoke Island.
That mandatory evacuation means visitors can no longer travel to Ocracoke.
Law enforcement will be stationed at each ferry terminal to allow only residents, property-owners, and vendors access to Ocracoke Thursday and Friday.
It also means that ferry routes servicing Ocracoke Island will be on a first-come-first-serve basis.
Property owners and vendors entering Ocracoke on Thursday and Friday should realize there is a possibility they may not be able to get off the island via Hatteras.
