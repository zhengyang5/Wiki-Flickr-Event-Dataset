ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 23 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 1100 AM EDT SAT OCT 03 2015 The satellite presentation has improved during the past 12 hours. A distinct eye is clearly observed in conventional imagery, and it is surrounded by very deep convection. A blend of subjective and objective Dvorak estimates of 6.0 and 6.5 T-numbers, and a peak flight-level wind of 128 kt at 700 mb reported by a reconnaissance aircraft yields an initial intensity of 115 kt. The central pressure has dropped to 936 mb in the last reconnaissance fix. Despite the small increase in the initial intensity, the NHC forecast, which is very close to the intensity model consensus, calls for gradual weakening due to increasing shear and cooler waters. By the end of the forecast period, Joaquin is expected to have lost tropical characteristics. Reconnaissance and satellite fixes indicate that Joaquin is moving toward the northeast or 050 degrees at an average speed of 12 kt. The hurricane is currently embedded within the flow between a deep eastward-moving trough over the southeastern United States and a subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic. As the trough over the United States swings eastward, the hurricane will likely turn more to the north-northeast with some increase in forward speed during the next 12 to 24 hours. Then, as the trough weakens, the hurricane could slow down while moving west of Bermuda during late Sunday. After that time, Joaquin is expected to become fully embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies and accelerate eastward toward the northeast Atlantic. The NHC forecast is very similar to the previous one, on top of the multi-model consensus, and in the middle of the guidance envelope. Although the confidence in the track forecast has increased due to the good agreement among models, a small deviation to the east of the forecast track would bring the core of the hurricane with stronger winds closer to Bermuda.
