ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM TROPICAL STORM JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 5 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 1100 PM EDT MON SEP 28 2015 Satellite images indicate that the shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the depression has increased and become better organized during the past several hours.
The latest Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB were 2.5/35 kt, and the initial intensity is set at that value, making the cyclone Tropical Storm Joaquin.
The center of Joaquin has been moving southwestward during the last several hours, but it is expected to begin moving slowly westward overnight.
This westward track is forecast to continue for a couple of days while a mid-level ridge remains to the north of the storm.
The official intensity forecast is raised from the previous one, but is lower than the intensity model consensus at days 3-5.
