The 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, with overall activity about 35 percent below normal, has met the quiet preseason expectations.
But forecasters have stressed inactive seasons can produce nasty storms and Hurricane Joaquin proved their point.
Through October 12, 10 named storms and three hurricanes – two of them becoming major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher) – have been born in the Atlantic.
Of all these storms, Joaquin was the strongest, by far.
That brings 2015 up to approximately 65 percent of an average season by this date — so still decidedly “quiet” overall.
