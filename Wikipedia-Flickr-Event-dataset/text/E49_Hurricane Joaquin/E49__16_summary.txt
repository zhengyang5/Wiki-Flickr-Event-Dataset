ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 21 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 1100 PM EDT FRI OCT 02 2015 Fixes from an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft indicate the core of Joaquin has gradually begun to move away from the central Bahamas.
Joaquin could fluctuate in intensity during the next 12 to 24 hours, but given that the shear is expected to increase, the NHC forecast calls for very gradual weakening.
As the trough swings eastward, Joaquin will become fully embedded within the mid-latitude westerly flow.
This flow pattern will steer Joaquin to the northeast with a gradual increase in forward speed.
The multi-model consensus has shifted eastward tonight, and consequently the NHC forecast was also shifted eastward a little.
