As Bermuda prepares for the impact of Hurricane Joaquin, the approaching storm is already having an effect in that two cruise visits to the island have been cancelled and rerouted.

Carnival Sunshine was scheduled for an eight-night sailing to Bermuda but the cruise line announced the 3,006-passenger vessel instead would head to the Eastern Caribbean

A spokesperson said, “We have been keeping a very close eye on Hurricane Joaquin, which is a major Category 4 storm in the Atlantic. Due to the impact this strong hurricane is expected to have on our chartered course, it is not possible for us to safely navigate to Bermuda.

“To ensure the safety and comfort of our guests and crew, we have no choice but to change our itinerary. We will instead operate an Eastern Caribbean cruise with visits to San Juan, St. Thomas, and Grand Turk.

“Guests will receive a 25% cruise discount on their next 2-8 day Carnival cruise.”

A USA Today article reports that, “Royal Caribbean late Friday said the Bayonne, N.J.-based Liberty of the Seas will sail for St. John, Canada on Saturday instead of Bermuda to avoid the powerful storm.

“The 3,634-passenger ship was scheduled to arrive in Bermuda on Monday for a two-night stay before returning to Bayonne on Thursday.”
