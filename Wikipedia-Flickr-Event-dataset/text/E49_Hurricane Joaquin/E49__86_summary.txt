Joaquin was a Category 3 storm as it approached on Sunday, falling to Category 2 as it passed 85 miles to the west at 9pm.
The West End bore the brunt of Joaquins passing, with one casualty being Dockyards historic Commissioners House.
Hurricane Joaquin forced two cruise ships to abandon their trips to Bermuda and put a significant dent in the Islands container ship schedules.
The National Hurricane Centre showed a tropical wave around 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles, but its chances of turning into a storm were ranked as low.
