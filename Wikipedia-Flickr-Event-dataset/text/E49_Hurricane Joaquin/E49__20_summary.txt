ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 26 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 1100 PM AST SAT OCT 03 2015 While the cloud pattern has deteriorated a little this evening, reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that Joaquin is still a Category 4 hurricane.
Joaquin has moved a little to the right for the past several hours and the initial motion is now 050/17.
However, it is likely to be a Category 2 hurricane in 24-36 hours at the time of closest approach to Bermuda.
Extratropical transition should begin around 72 hours and be complete by 96 hours, with the winds decreasing below hurricane force during the transition.
The combination of the shift in the forecast track and the expansion of the hurricane-force winds requires a hurricane warning for Bermuda at this time.
