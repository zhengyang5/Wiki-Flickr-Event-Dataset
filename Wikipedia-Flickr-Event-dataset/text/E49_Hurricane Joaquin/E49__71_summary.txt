By KHRISNA VIRGILTribune Staff Reporterkvirgil@tribunemedia.netPRIME Minister Perry Christie said the government cannot declare certain areas in the storm-affected Family Islands as no build zones unless it passes legislation in Parliament to recognise those areas as vulnerable.
He said while this and other major decisions are before Cabinet, the government will encourage people to build in elevated areas with very specific building requirements that can withstand future natural disasters.
Capt Russell said following previous hurricanes, homes were rebuilt elevated off the ground using stilts.
Former Director of Works Melanie Roach is heading a special committee for the rebuilding of homes, roads and government buildings.
The act (would) empower us to recognise vulnerable areas to place ourselves in the position where we can say that you cannot build in that area.
