A GROUP of Bahamians led by Long Islander George Cartwright are appealing for urgent supplies to be donated so that they can be flown to the hurricane-ravaged island on Sunday morning.
Mr Cartwright, a contractor in Nassau, organised two helicopters and a seaplane on Saturday to take essential supplies - particularly water - in a successful mission to Long Island.
The supplies will be flown to Stella Maris airport, which re-opened on Saturday afternoon.
The back-up plan would be to fly into Exuma, take them across by boat to Long Island and hope that trucks could get them up to Stella Maris.
Reports from the mission to Long Island on Saturday suggest Gray's and Salt Pond are still under water and that from Gray’s to Gordon’s in the south the situation is “really bad”.
