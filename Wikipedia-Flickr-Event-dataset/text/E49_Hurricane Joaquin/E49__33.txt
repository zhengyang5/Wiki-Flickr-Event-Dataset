Hurricane Joaquin, the category 4 storm that struck the Bahamas, is affecting air travel and cruise lines in the area.

Lynden Pindling Airport in Nassau is closed and expected to open Saturday morning at 7 a.m. Eastern. American Airlines has also canceled its one scheduled departure from Exuma International Airport and one out of two departures from Providenciales International Airport in the Turks and Caicos, a destination also hit by Joaquin. Though the airport suspended flight operations yesterday, the website says that it plans to resume them today starting at 4 p.m.

Delta Airlines issued a waiver Wednesday for three Bahamian destinations and extended it Friday to include customers ticketed through Oct. 4. Seven flights to and from the Bahamas were canceled Friday due to an air traffic control decision to close the region to flying, but a Delta spokesperson said that no additional cancellations are expected.

Cruise lines have not canceled any trips, though some have rerouted their itineraries to avoid ports in the Bahamas.
