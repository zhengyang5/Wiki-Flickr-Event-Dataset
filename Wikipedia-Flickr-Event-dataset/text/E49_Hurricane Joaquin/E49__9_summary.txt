ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 16 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 500 PM EDT THU OCT 01 2015 The earlier Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported 700-mb flight-level winds of 120 kt in the southwestern eyewall, with a subsequent 114-kt surface wind estimate from the Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer in the southeastern eyewall.
Based on these data, the intensity was increased to 115 kt at 1800 UTC, making Joaquin a Category 4 hurricane.
Joaquin has moved with a more westward component during the past few hours and the initial motion is now 235/5.
The dynamical models forecast this trough to become a cut-off low as it moves southeastward and weakens the ridge.
In addition, very heavy rains, not associated with Joaquin, are expected to produce flooding over portions of the Atlantic coastal states.
