"This vessel is disabled basically right near the eye of Hurricane Joaquin," said Capt Mark Fedor.
The Coast Guard said the crew earlier reported it had been able to contain the flooding.
Joaquin had maximum sustained winds of 125mph, the US National Hurricane Centre said.
Hurricane force winds extended outward up to 50 miles and a hurricane watch was in effect for Bimini and Andros.
"We no longer have any models forecasting the hurricane to come into the East Coast," he said.
