By NEIL HARTNELLTribune Business Editornhartnell@tribunemedia.netTotal insured losses from Hurricane Joaquin will likely total between $25-$30 million, Tribune Business was told yesterday, with the sector set to reassess its underwriting approach following the storm.
“At this point, I would say the market loss for all lines is going to be somewhere in the region of $25-$30 million,” Mr Ward told Tribune Business of the likely level of Joaquin-related claims.
Mr Ward said the low penetration of insurance in the Joaquin-ravaged islands stemmed from personal choices by their residents and businesses, rather than lack of product availability.
“It’s not a question of whether it’s available,” he told Tribune Business.
Still, Mr Ward said Joaquin’s losses for the insurance industry would have no impact on its reinsurance costs for next year.
