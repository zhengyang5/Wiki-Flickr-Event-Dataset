By SANCHESKA BROWNTribune Staff Reportersbrown@tribunemedia.netLONG Island MP Loretta Butler-Turner said yesterday that her constituency’s economy – specifically the fishing and farming industries – has been “completely devastated” by the passage of Hurricane Joaquin.
The category four hurricane battered Long Island two weeks ago, causing widespread destruction.
Many homes and buildings were destroyed, trees were uprooted, power lines were knocked down and streets were left flooded.
Mrs Butler-Turner said most persons, who have been fishing and farming for decades, now have to start to rebuild their businesses from scratch.
The economy of Long Island has been gravely impacted.
