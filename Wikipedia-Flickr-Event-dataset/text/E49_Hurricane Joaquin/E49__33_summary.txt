PhotoHurricane Joaquin, the category 4 storm that struck the Bahamas, is affecting air travel and cruise lines in the area.
Lynden Pindling Airport in Nassau is closed and expected to open Saturday morning at 7 a.m. Eastern.
American Airlines has also canceled its one scheduled departure from Exuma International Airport and one out of two departures from Providenciales International Airport in the Turks and Caicos, a destination also hit by Joaquin.
Seven flights to and from the Bahamas were canceled Friday due to an air traffic control decision to close the region to flying, but a Delta spokesperson said that no additional cancellations are expected.
Cruise lines have not canceled any trips, though some have rerouted their itineraries to avoid ports in the Bahamas.
