ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 28 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 1100 AM AST SUN OCT 04 2015 The overall cloud pattern of Joaquin has changed little since the previous advisory.
Recon center fixes indicate that Joaquin has made the expected turn toward the north-northeast, and is now moving 030/15 kt.
On the short term forecast track, the center of Joaquin is expected to pass about 60 nmi west and northwest of Bermuda during the next 12-24 hours.
By days 2-5, Joaquin is forecast to accelerate to the east-northeast as the cyclone gets caught up in the fast mid-latitude westerlies.
The new NHC track forecast is essentially just an update of the previous advisory track, albeit slightly slower, and lies down the middle of the tightly packed track model guidance.
