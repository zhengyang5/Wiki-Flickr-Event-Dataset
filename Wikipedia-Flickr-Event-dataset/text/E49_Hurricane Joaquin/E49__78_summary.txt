Searchers for a U.S. cargo ship feared lost in Hurricane Joaquin found floating containers, life jackets and life rings today that officials say are consistent with what might have come from the missing El Faro.
While the objects were found near the boat's last known position off the Bahamas, it was not confirmed that any of them were from the El Faro, Nash said.
The first possible trace of the El Faro was a life ring found by the Coast Guard on Saturday.
Two additional life rings have been found, but itâ€™s unclear if they belonged to the ship, the Coast Guard said.
The El Faro was traveling from Jacksonville, Florida, to San Juan, Puerto Rico, as Joaquin churned over the Atlantic Ocean.
