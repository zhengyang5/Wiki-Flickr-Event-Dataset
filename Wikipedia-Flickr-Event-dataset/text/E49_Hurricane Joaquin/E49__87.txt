Belco still addressing 14 outages

Although the number of customers without power shot up today, Belco advised that as of this evening only 14 customers remained without electricity.

As of 8.40pm, we are back down to 14 outages, a spokeswoman for the utility company said.

At 4.40pm, 60 customers were without electricity, down from more than 100 reported earlier this afternoon.

By the time Belco crews were stood down last night, 17 customers were without power. However, that number rose during the night to more than 100 overnight.

Some customers, who had power restored after the hurricane, lost power again as a result of the early morning rain, wind and thunder storms, the spokeswoman said.

It is not unusual for this to occur, as hurricane winds can cause salt deposits that affect connections, and parts of the system would have been weakened by trees and flying debris.

The spokeswoman added that some customers were also temporarily taken offline today so that crews could repair other sections of the system.

Much of the work that is being done today is both time and resource consuming, she said.

An example of this is extensive tree trimming and the stringing of large spans of cable that need to be replaced.

She added that crews are working hard to get everyone back on as soon as possible and reminded customers, who turned off power at their breaker switch, to make sure the breaker is turned back on after repairs have been completed.
