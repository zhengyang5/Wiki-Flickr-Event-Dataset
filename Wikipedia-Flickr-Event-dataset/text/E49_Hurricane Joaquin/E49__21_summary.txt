ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 27 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 500 AM AST SUN OCT 04 2015 The cloud pattern of Joaquin has continued to gradually deteriorate overnight with most of the deep convection now located over the eastern and southeastern portions of the circulation.
After passing the Bermuda Joaquin is expected to turn northeastward, then east-northeastward after 48 hours when it reaches the mid-latitude westerlies.
Moderate to strong southwesterly shear is expected to cause some weakening during the next 12 to 24 hours, but Joaquin is forecast to remain a strong hurricane while it passes near or over Bermuda later today.
Gradual weakening should continue after 24 hours, as the hurricane encounters cooler waters and remains within an environment of moderate shear.
Joaquin is expected to become an extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic in a little more than 72 hours.
