Apart from damage to the hotel itself, Club Med indicated that the devastation inflicted on San Salvador’s airport, utilities and communications infrastructure also played a role in its postponement decision.
In order to ensure our guests have the highest level of service and comfort, we have taken the decision to revise the reopening date to December 20, 2015,” Club Med said.
“We are currently assessing the impact of the storm to the resort and the infrastructure on the island,”Club Med reiterated.
It also generates most of the spin-off activity and business opportunities on San Salvador.
Club Med is the largest private sector asset to be directly impacted by Joaquin, which also brought massive storm surges and flooding.
