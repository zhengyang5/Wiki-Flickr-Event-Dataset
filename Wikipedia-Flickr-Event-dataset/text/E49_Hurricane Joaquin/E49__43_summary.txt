The Royal Bermuda Regiment [RBR] tonight [Oct 2] are gearing up in case Hurricane Joaquin hits the Island on Sunday.
Equipment will tomorrow morning be stationed east of the Causeway in case the east end is cut off and up to 120 troops are on 12 hours notice to deploy.
He said: “We take our hurricane preparedness very seriously.
“We had the experience of Fay and Gonzalo last October in quick succession and we have refined our response even further as a result of that 10 day deployment.
Col Foster-Brown added the Regt had been asked to be prepared to provide up to 17 soldiers to help residential care homes ride out the hurricane if it comes.
