ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 33 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 500 PM AST MON OCT 05 2015 Joaquin's cloud pattern has actually improved somewhat since the previous advisory with a cloud-filled eye having briefly appeared in visible satellite imagery.
Satellite intensity estimates are T4.5/77 kt from SAB, T4.3/72 kt from the NHC AODT technique, and T4.0/65 kt from TAFB.
This intensity is also supported by dropsonde data from the NASA WB-57 aircraft, which has been conducting research in Joaquin for the Office of Naval Operation's Tropical Cyclone Intensity experiment.
Joaquin is rounding the northwestern periphery of a weak ridge located to its southeast, and will be entering the faster mid-latitude westerlies by Tuesday morning.
At 48-120 hours, the extratropical forecast track is based on guidance provided by the NOAA Ocean Prediction Center.
