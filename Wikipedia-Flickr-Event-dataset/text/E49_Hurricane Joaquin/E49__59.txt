A GROUP of Bahamians led by Long Islander George Cartwright are appealing for urgent supplies to be donated so that they can be flown to the hurricane-ravaged island on Sunday morning.

Mr Cartwright, a contractor in Nassau, organised two helicopters and a seaplane on Saturday to take essential supplies - particularly water - in a successful mission to Long Island.

The group is asking for supplies to be dropped off at at a reception point just inside the entrance to Odyssey Aviation at Lynden Pindling International Airport from 7.15am on Sunday. They are asking especially for donations of water, food, tinned supplies and clothing.

The supplies will be flown to Stella Maris airport, which re-opened on Saturday afternoon. The back-up plan would be to fly into Exuma, take them across by boat to Long Island and hope that trucks could get them up to Stella Maris.

Reports from the mission to Long Island on Saturday suggest Gray's and Salt Pond are still under water and that from Gray’s to Gordon’s in the south the situation is “really bad”. All utility poles are down and stories are being brought back of dead animals - goats, chickens, dogs - floating in the water.

Speculation is of a number of deaths, not only from collapsing roofs but from drowning.
