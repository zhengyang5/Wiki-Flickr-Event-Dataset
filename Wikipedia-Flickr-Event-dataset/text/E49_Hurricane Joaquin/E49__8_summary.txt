ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 13 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 1100 PM EDT WED SEP 30 2015 Joaquin has rapidly intensified during the past 24 hours with the satellite presentation continuing to improve this evening.
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft that has been investigating the hurricane this evening has measured peak 700 mb flight-level winds of 113 kt and 102 kt surface winds from the SFMR.
These data support an initial intensity of 100 kt, making Joaquin the second major hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season.
These heavy rains are likely to continue for the next few days, even if the center of Joaquin stays offshore.
The resulting inland flood potential could complicate preparations for Joaquin should it head toward the coast, and even more substantial inland flooding is possible if Joaquin later passes near or over these same areas.
