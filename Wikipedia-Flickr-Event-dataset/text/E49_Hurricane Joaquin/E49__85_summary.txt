WASHINGTON — The United States Coast Guard has rescued 12 people who abandoned their 212-foot cargo ship that began taking on water north of Haiti.
Coast Guard officials in Miami say the rescue took place Thursday evening as the area experienced heavy weather caused by Hurricane Joaquin.
Officials say they received a message from the British coast guard about the Bolivian-flagged cargo ship Minouche.
