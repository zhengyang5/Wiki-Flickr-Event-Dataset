The effects of the Hurricane Joaquin are being compared to that of 1992's Hurricane Andrew.
The call has gone out for people to donate to the cause, which Mrs Butler-Turner described as a "long-term project".
She said there was heavy flooding in Long Island particularly.
Electrical services and communications remained down, and Father Keith Cartwright, sitting alongside Mrs Butler-Turner at a press briefing this afternoon, said that prayers are needed.
The Commissioner was on board a police flight over the affected islands en route to Stella Maris airport, Long Island.
