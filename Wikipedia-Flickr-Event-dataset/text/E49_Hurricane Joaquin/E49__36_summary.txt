It said the threat of significant flooding in portions of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina would continue for two or three days.
Elsewhere, coastal flooding remained a threat â€” particularly in the Virginia Beach area and the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
The battering rain came along the Southeast coast even as forecasters said Hurricane Joaquin was no longer a threat to the region.
The hurricane center said Joaquin would begin weakening through Sunday, but would remain a hurricane in its northeastward trek.
