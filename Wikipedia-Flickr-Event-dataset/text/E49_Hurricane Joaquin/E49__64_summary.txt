POLICE Commissioner Ellison Greenslade yesterday said there was no loss of life in Long Island from Hurricane Joaquin, despite earlier unconfirmed reports of multiple deaths associated with the category four storm.
“There was a family that we were told had drowned (in Long Island), and people I spoke to last night (Saturday) were almost 100 per cent certain they were dead.
During a press briefing on Saturday after an aerial assessment of some of the affected areas, Prime Minister Perry Christie downplayed rumours about widespread deaths in Long Island from the hurricane.
“There has been a rumour and speculation about loss of life on Long island,” Mr Christie said on Saturday.
The slow moving storm left “devastation” in Long Island, Acklins, Crooked Island and Rum Cay in particular, destroying homes and building with strong winds and heavy flooding.
