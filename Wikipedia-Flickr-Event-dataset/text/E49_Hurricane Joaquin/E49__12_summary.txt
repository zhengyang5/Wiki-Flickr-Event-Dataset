ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 17 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 1100 PM EDT THU OCT 01 2015 The eye of Joaquin contracted in satellite imagery late this afternoon, but has become obscured by cirrus clouds since that time.
Joaquin is forecast to encounter increasing southwesterly shear in 2 to 3 days, which is expected to cause some weakening during that time.
However, Joaquin is expected to remain a large and powerful hurricane for the next several days.
This should cause Joaquin to turn northward on Friday, and move north-northeastward at a faster forward speed Friday night and Saturday.
In addition, very heavy rains, not associated with Joaquin, are expected to produce flooding over portions of the Atlantic coastal states.
