The effects of the Hurricane Joaquin are being compared to that of 1992's Hurricane Andrew.

Loretta Butler-Turner MP said that relief crews flying over Long Island had seen groups of people who had banded together for survival waving to signal they needed rescue.

Mrs Butler-Turner said: "The saddest part of all of this is that probably for the first time in many many years we have speculation that there are multiple deaths from this hurricane."

The call has gone out for people to donate to the cause, which Mrs Butler-Turner described as a "long-term project". She said there was heavy flooding in Long Island particularly.

Electrical services and communications remained down, and Father Keith Cartwright, sitting alongside Mrs Butler-Turner at a press briefing this afternoon, said that prayers are needed.

However, Ellison Greenslade, the Commissioner of Police, said on Twitter on Saturday evening that he had no reports of confirmed deaths. "This is the Commissioner of Police and as of this time I have no information of any deaths directly related to Joaquin," he tweeted from @COPGreenslade. The Commissioner was on board a police flight over the affected islands en route to Stella Maris airport, Long Island.
