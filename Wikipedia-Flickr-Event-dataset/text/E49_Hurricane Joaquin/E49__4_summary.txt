ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM TROPICAL STORM JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 6 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 500 AM EDT TUE SEP 29 2015 The low-level center of Joaquin remains exposed on the northwestern edge of the deep convection due to about 20 kt of shear.
After moving quickly southwestward earlier, the center of Joaquin appears to be moving more slowly westward at about 4 kt.
Needless to say, confidence in the details of the track forecast, especially beyond 48 hours, is extremely low.
As noted above, the latest run of the GFS dissipates Joaquin in 3 to 4 days.
Given the uncertainty in Joaquin's structure and track, the new NHC forecast remains conservative, and is closest to the SHIPS model and below the intensity consensus.
