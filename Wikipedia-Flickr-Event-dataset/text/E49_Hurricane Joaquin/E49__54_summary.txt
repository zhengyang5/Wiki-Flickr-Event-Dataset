By NICO SCAVELLATribune Staff Reporternscavella@tribunemedia.netNEARLY 100 people have been evacuated - some for medical reasons - from islands severely impacted by Hurricane Joaquin by two private relief air operators this week.
At the time Mr Hinsey spoke to The Tribune on Friday afternoon, he said another three people were scheduled to be evacuated and brought to New Providence.
According to Mr Hinsey, a DC-3 airplane making a round-trip from Nassau to Long Island to carry supplies costs an average of $8,000.
"So we're doing everything we can to keep things going," Mr Aranha added on Friday.
Mr Aranha added that there have been no "hiccups" in carrying out the initiative.
