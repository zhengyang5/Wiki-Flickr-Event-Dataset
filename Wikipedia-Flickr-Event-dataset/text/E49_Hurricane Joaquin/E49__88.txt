Fresh roof damage at Commissioner’s Point

Commissioners House at Dockyard, which was dealt extensive roof damage by last years back-to-back hurricanes, lost another section of its roof during last nights storm.

An official statement is to come later today from the National Museum of Bermuda, but early reports are that the last remaining piece of the historic buildings old roof was lost to Hurricane Joaquin.

The building at the tip of Ireland Island sits at a particularly exposed point, and the West End was forecast to receive the worst of the storm as it passed just west of the Island last night.
