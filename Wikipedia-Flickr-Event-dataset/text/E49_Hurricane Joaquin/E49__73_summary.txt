Speaking to a crowd of nearly 50 locals at North Long Island High school in Simms, Mrs Butler-Turner insisted that despite the devastation left in the wake of Hurricane Joaquin, Long Island will recover.
The order covers relief of residents in Acklins, Cat Island, Crooked Island, Exuma, Inagua, Long Cay, Long Island, Mayaguana, Rum Cay, Ragged Island, Samana Cay and San Salvador which suffered hardship or loss as a result of Hurricane Joaquin, and whose claims/applications in respect of such goods are certified by the director of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
Meanwhile, Mrs Butler-Turner moved to clarify issues surrounding the stormâ€™s timeline as it related to Long Island.
She added that by the time an official warning was issued early Thursday, the island of Long Island was already in the preliminary throes of the massive category four storm.
Reports presented by Mrs Butler-Turner indicated that the island at that time was experiencing 170mph winds, with sustained winds of 200mph and wind gust up to 220mph.
