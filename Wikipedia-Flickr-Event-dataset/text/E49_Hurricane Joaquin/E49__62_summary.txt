A Category 4 Hurricane Joaquin near its Oct. 1 peak intensity period.
While it’s true the Bahamas are no stranger to strong hurricanes, Joaquin has already vaulted into the top five strongest storms on record to impact the islands.
According to the National Hurricane Center’s Eric Blake, Joaquin dipped to the lowest pressure of any Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Igor in 2010.
For comparison, the lowest pressure on record in an Atlantic hurricane came with Wilma at 882 millibars.
Hurricane Joaquin continues to loom over the Bahamas, making it one of the most devastating hurricanes to hit the Bahamas on record.
