ZCZC MIATCDAT1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM HURRICANE JOAQUIN DISCUSSION NUMBER 18 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112015 500 AM EDT FRI OCT 02 2015 The eye of Joaquin has not been apparent in recent infrared imagery.
The initial intensity remains 115 kt pending the arrival of the next aircraft before 12Z.
After that time, gradual weakening is forecast as the cyclone encounters increasing southwesterly shear, but Joaquin is expected to remain a powerful hurricane for the next several days.
However, there is still uncertainty in how close Joaquin could come to Bermuda, extreme southeastern New England/Cape Cod, and Nova Scotia during the next several days, and interests in those areas should continue to monitor the progress of the hurricane.
In addition, very heavy rains, not associated with Joaquin, are expected to produce flooding over portions of the Atlantic coastal states.
