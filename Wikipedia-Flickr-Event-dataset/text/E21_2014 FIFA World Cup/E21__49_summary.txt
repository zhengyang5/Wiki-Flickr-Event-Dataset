This year's group stage total of 136 fell just one short of the numbers for the entire 2010 World Cup, with 16 games still to play.
The 24-year-old, who hit the winner against the US and a hat-trick against Portugal, has nine World Cup goals in as many games.
Messi's quartet is more surprising than you might think, too: In eight World Cup matches prior to 2014, the four-time player of the year had found the net just once.
Xherdan Shaqiri's hat-trick against Honduras saved the Swiss; the want-away Bayern midfielder is one of six players to net three in the group games.
Entering the knockout phases always gives a World Cup even more of a tournament feel.
