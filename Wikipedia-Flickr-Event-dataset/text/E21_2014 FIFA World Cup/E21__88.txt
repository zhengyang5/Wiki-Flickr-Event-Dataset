Lufthansa (Frankfurt) will temporarily rename 8 aircraft with “Fanhansa” titles for the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

The first aircraft to have these unique titles is expected to be an Airbus A321, due to be unveiled on May 16.

The company issued this statement (translated from German):

In the summer of 2014, the biggest football event in the world keeps all fans in suspense. Part of the Lufthansa fleet will be temporarily unceremoniously renamed “Fanhansa”.

Fanhansa – this is not only a commitment to be a big fan of the German football team itself. This is also a clear message to all soccer fans: No matter what game it is, Fanhansa inspires the fans and brings them to the big soccer events around the world.

As a partner of the German Football Association, Lufthansa flies the national team and numerous media representatives and many thousands of football fans to Brazil. Of course, when you board a “Fanhansa” flight, expect to see numerous surprises.
