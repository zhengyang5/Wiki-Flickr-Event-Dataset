Tens of thousands of people descended onto Iracema Beach in Fortaleza on Sunday evening in an event which saw the city in north-east Brazil captivated by FIFA World Cup™ fever. The beach was the venue for the official kick-off of the FIFA Fan Fest for Brazil 2014, an event which offers fans a free entertainment extravanagza every day during the tournament.

Brazilian football legend Ronaldo joined famous names from the world of Brazilian music to celebrate a show which featured top quality music, culture and iconic moments from past World Cup events. Bell Marques, Dorgival Dantas and Simone e Samaria were the three headline bands, performing full concerts to the full-capacity audience.

“It’s fantastic to see so many fans down celebrating the FIFA Fan Fest. What a fantastic place to enjoy the FIFA World Cup with friends and family. I’m hoping to get some spare time to join in the party in the days to come,” said Ronaldo.

Fuleco, the Official Mascot of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil was also on hand to show off his dancing moves and presented one lucky fan with two tickets to the Brazil-Mexico match in Fortaleza.

The show is set to continue on Thursday, when FIFA Fan Fests in all 12 Host Cities will open their doors to public, giving Brazilian and international football fans the opportunity to experience the unique FIFA World Cup experience free of charge.
