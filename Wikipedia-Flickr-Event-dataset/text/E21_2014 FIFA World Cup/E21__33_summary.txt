FIFA, the Local Organising Committee and FIFA Partner adidas today revealed the name of the Official Match Ball for the 2014 FIFA World Cup™.
The ball will be called the “adidas Brazuca” following a public vote by over one million Brazilian football fans, where the name received 70 per cent of the vote.
*For the past three weeks, Brazilian football fans have been voting for their favourite name in their thousands.
This is the first time that fans have been directly involved in the naming of the FIFA World Cup ball.
Although the name of the ball is now clear, fans will have to wait a little bit longer until they can actually see the adidas Brazuca ball.
