World Cup final referee Nicola Rizzoli told the Gazzetta dello Sport that German midfielder Christoph Kramer was uncertain whether he was playing in the World Cup final after sustaining a head injury.
Kramer suffered a blow to the head in the 14th minute of the final against Argentina, but he continued playing before he collapsed in the 31st minute.
Rizzoli, an Italian referee, said that Kramer was disoriented and confused after suffering the initial blow.
A similar incident occurred in the World Cup involving Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira.
