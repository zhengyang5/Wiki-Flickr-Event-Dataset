Reuters reports that the protests entered into the second day of the Confederations Cup, near Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium where Mexico lost 2-1 to Italy.

A number of arrests were made while there were reports of injuries after police used tear gas and rubber bullets, as protesters demonstrated against the cost of next year's World Cup.

It is felt by some that the money - alleged to be increasingly from a public, rather than private, source - being spent on stadiums would be better used on education and hospitals.

A government statement said: "Authorities will not allow any disturbance of public order or any threats against the match. It's guaranteed that fans have complete access to the stadium."

On Friday, around 200 people burned tyres and blocked the main road outside the Estadio Nacional Mane Garrincha in the capital Brasilia.

The BBC reports that up to 1,000 Brazilians protested in the vicinity the National Stadium in Brasilia on Saturday, where the host nation opened the tournament with a 3-0 win over Japan.
