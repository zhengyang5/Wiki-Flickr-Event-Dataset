Goals, controversy, hat-tricks and first-round shocks - the 2014 World Cup has been box-office and record-breaking.

A total of 136 goals is the highest since the group stages took on a 32-team format in 1998, bettering the 130 plundered in 2002.

The Opta scoring system is devised by working out an overall score based on over 250 statistical events, with each event having a positive/negative score awarded based on its outcome. More important stat categories are weighted heavier than others, so crucial stats during games make a difference (goals, assists, clean sheets, etc).
