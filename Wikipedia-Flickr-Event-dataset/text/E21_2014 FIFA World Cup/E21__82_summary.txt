SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Less than half of Brazilians favor the nation’s hosting of the World Cup in June, with a majority in the soccer-crazed nation believing that the tournament will do more harm than good, a poll showed on Tuesday.
Construction workers on strike stand outside the Rio 2016 Olympic Park construction site in Rio de Janeiro April 8, 2014.
The result is surprising for the soccer-loving nation that has won five World Cup titles, more than any other country.
Pessimism over the World Cup has increased even as Brazilians have largely abandoned street protests.
Another poll, conducted by Brazil’s MDA in February, found that most Brazilians opposed hosting the World Cup and believed the billions of dollars spent on the event should be directed elsewhere, such as towards healthcare and education.
