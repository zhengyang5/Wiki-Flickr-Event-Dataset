Stadium staff struggled to deal with a serious failure in security measures at the Maracanã before Chile’s match against Spain on Wednesday as around 100 supporters charged through the stadium media centre, causing havoc and damaging walls and equipment. Some were detained by police but it appeared that others achieved their objective of reaching the stands.

The fans, most of them wearing the red of Chile, smashed a glass door and knocked over two partition walls, sending three television sets crashing to the floor.

Fifa said in a statement that “a group of individuals without tickets violently forced entry into the stadium, breaking fences and overrunning security. They were contained by the security and did not make it to the seats. The situation was brought under control quickly and at least 85 intruders were detained, according to the military police of Rio de Janeiro. The organisers of the Fifa World Cup condemn these acts of violence and we will communicate further information and measures to be taken.”

After the initial shock there was an air of farce as the fans, having run past the escalators that would have gained them entry to the stands, ran hither and thither seeking a way in, chased by security. They seemed to have passed the initial line of security guarding the stadium compound by scaling a 10ft high wire gate and bypassing simple temporary barriers, then running through the X-ray scanning area which the world’s media pass through.

Given the range of ages and appearances of those involved, this seemed a spontaneous attempt to gain entry to the game rather than an orchestrated plan by a hooligan group. Around 20 Argentinian fans breached security before their game against Bosnia. Thousands of Chilean fans have descended on Rio de Janeiro in the past few days. They had arrived at the stadium several hours before kick-off filling the streets outside with raucous singing and letting off volleys of firecrackers.
