Built for the 1950 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, the Estadio Jornalista Mario Filho, better known as the Maracana, provided the venue for that year’s truly memorable decider between the host nation and Uruguay, one of the most dramatic chapters in the history of the competition.
The Rio de Janeiro stadium will be in the limelight once again at Brazil 2014, hosting seven games in all, more than any other venue.
The stadium is also be fitted with a new roof complete with a rainwater collection system.
The facade, which has been listed by the National Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage, remains untouched.
Rio’s second most popular tourist attraction, the Maracana continued to attract football fans from all over the world, even as it underwent renovation.
