Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke is concerned over the readiness of three stadiums scheduled to host games at the World Cup, which begins on 12 June.
Valcke has expressed his fears over preparations in Natal, Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo, venue for the opening game between Brazil and Croatia.
Its Beira Rio stadium, which will have five matches at the Fifa World Cup, hosted a test event between Internacional and Penarol of Uruguay in April.
"I have absolutely no doubt that the World Cup will start on time," Boyce told BBC Radio 5live.
However Ronaldo, who scored both goals in the final when Brazil won the Fifa World Cup in 2002, says he feels "embarrassed" about the state of the country's infrastructure around the forthcoming tournament.
