Stadium staff struggled to deal with a serious failure in security measures at the Maracanã before Chile’s match against Spain on Wednesday as around 100 supporters charged through the stadium media centre, causing havoc and damaging walls and equipment.
The fans, most of them wearing the red of Chile, smashed a glass door and knocked over two partition walls, sending three television sets crashing to the floor.
The situation was brought under control quickly and at least 85 intruders were detained, according to the military police of Rio de Janeiro.
Around 20 Argentinian fans breached security before their game against Bosnia.
Thousands of Chilean fans have descended on Rio de Janeiro in the past few days.
