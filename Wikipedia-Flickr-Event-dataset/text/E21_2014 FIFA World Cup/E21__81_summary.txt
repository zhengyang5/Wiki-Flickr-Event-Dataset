From the Amazon basin in the north to the banks of the River Guaiba in the south, 12 stadiums across Brazil will play host to matches at next summer's World Cup.
Although it was the second World Cup venue to be completed, in February 2013, teething problems resulted in the stadium's operators being fined.
Work only began in earnest in September 2010 - three years after Brazil was officially handed the World Cup.
That makes it the most expensive of Brazil's World Cup venues, and reportedly the second costliest football venue ever built.
It is one of the smallest World Cup venues, and there are question marks over its long-term value after the tournament.
