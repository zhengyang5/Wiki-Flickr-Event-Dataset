The 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ serves as a benchmark in the development of a new strategy in the fight against doping, with the introduction of player biological profiling including blood and urine samples for the first time at a FIFA World Cup.
In accordance with FIFA Anti-doping Regulations, the remaining players can and will be tested at any time during the competition.
We are happy and proud that, for the first time in our history, all players participating to the FIFA World Cup will be controlled as well by blood as by urine examination."
World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Director General, David Howman, said: “We welcome the decision taken by FIFA to carry out this initiative.
In addition to the pre-competition controls, two players from each team will be tested for blood and urine at each match as part of the routine in-competition doping controls in accordance with the FIFA Anti-Doping Regulations.
