A worker has been killed after being electrocuted at a World Cup stadium in Brazil, officials say.

The 32-year-old man died in an accident at the new Arena Pantanal in the western city of Cuiaba where he was installing communications equipment.

It is the first fatality at the Cuiaba stadium, but eight workers have now died in accidents during the building of Brazil's 12 World Cup arenas.
