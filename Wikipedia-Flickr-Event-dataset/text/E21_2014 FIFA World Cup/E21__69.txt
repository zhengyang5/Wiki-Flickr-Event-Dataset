The 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ have witnessed some remarkable displays of goalkeeping from Guillermo Ochoa’s spectacular stop from Neymar, to Tim Howard’s record-breaking 16 saves against Belgium.

There’s also been a string of fine displays from Costa Rica’s Keylor Navas, penalty heroics from Sergio Romero and an almost Libero-esque display from Manuel Neuer in Germany’s clash with Algeria.

And it is the two Finalists, Neuer and Romero who head in FIFA’s Technical Study Group’s shortlist for the best goalkeeper at Brazil 2014.

Keylor Navas (CRC)

The Levante stopper was arguably Costa Rica’s best player at Brazil 2014, including a match-winning display in the Round of 16 tie against Greece. Making 21 saves in Los Ticos’ five games, he was awarded the Budweiser Man of the Match Award on three occasions. At 26-years-old the best years of his career are firmly ahead of him.

Manuel Neuer (GER)

The Germany keeper has played in all of the Nationalelf’s six games so far, making 25 saves and completing 202 passes. He’s kept three clean sheets and been a commanding presence for Joachim Low’s side so far. After winning a host of domestic honours, the UEFA Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup, the FIFA World Cup and the Golden Glove is now in his sights.

Sergio Romero (ARG)

Penalty shoot-out saves from Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneidjer sent La Albiceleste into the final, capping a fine tournament for the 27-year-old so far. The Monaco keeper has kept four clean sheets, making 15 saves in Brazil 2014 so far. Brought into international football by Diego Maradona, he has been Argentina’s first choice keeper for five years.
