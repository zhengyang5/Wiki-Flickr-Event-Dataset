RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer's head injury in the World Cup final on Sunday has revived concerns about the way football deals with concussions.
It was the latest in a series of head injuries at the World Cup that raised questions about the sideline medical checks.
In his absence, Germany went on to beat Argentina 1-0 in extra time to lift the World Cup.
The images provoked criticism from professional players' union FIFPro, head injury specialists and others.
The incidents have led to debate over whether FIFA should allow a temporary substitution so a player can get a head injury properly checked.
