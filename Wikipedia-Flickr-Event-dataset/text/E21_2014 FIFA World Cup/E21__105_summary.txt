"What mattered most was the result and this continued the tactical evolution of the team," said Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, whose side beat France 3-0 in a friendly last Sunday.
"I thought Neymar played very well, he ended a run without scoring, and I only took him off as he had a slight injury," added Scolari.
"I've no idea what happened outside the stadium, I have to focus on my team and I can't comment on that.
"Either way, I'm not that upset but I'm disappointed because we can play much better than that," he said.
"And to be honest, I haven't learnt that much about my team that I didn't know already - the truer test will come in the games against Mexico and Italy.
