Referees will be armed with the spray during matches to mark a line on the ground where the defensive wall, and ball, must be stationed during free-kicks.

The water-based spray, which disappears about a minute after use, has successfully been trialled during the Club World Cup in Marrakesh.

It will be used in addition to goal-line technology in Brazil, which is due to make its debut at the tournament to eradicate mistakes such as England midfielder Frank Lampard's disallowed goal against Germany in the second round of the 2010 World Cup.

"These are two new innovations and we've received positive feedback from teams, players and referees," Blatter told reporters in Marrakesh before Saturday's World Club Cup final between Bayern Munich and Raja Casablanca.

"Everyone has been convinced by the tools and we're similarly impressed. Goal-line technology and vanishing spray will be used at the FIFA World Cup in Brazil next year."

The vanishing spray, developed by Brazilian Pablo Silva, has previously been used in matches in South America and Major League Soccer in the United States.

FIFA first introduced it at this year's Under-20s World Cup in Turkey.

It is used to stop players in the defensive wall creeping closer to the ball, while a circle is also drawn where the ball is to be placed for a free-kick.
