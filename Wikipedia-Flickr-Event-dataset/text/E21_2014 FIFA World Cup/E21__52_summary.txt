CURITIBA, Brazil (AP) â€” Spain will take on Australia in its final Group B match Monday in the knowledge that defeat will officially make its defense of the World Cup the worst in history.
Following two straight defeats for both teams, neither can qualify for the knockout stages of the World Cup.
Following a six-year period of domination which has seen it win two straight European Championships as well as the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, Spain's woes at the World Cup have come as huge surprise.
For Australia, despite its two defeats, the World Cup can be viewed in a far more positive light.
Following a lackluster loss to Chile, Australia pushed the Netherlands during its narrow 3-2 loss.
