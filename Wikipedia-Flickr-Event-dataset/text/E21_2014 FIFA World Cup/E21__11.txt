The Brazilian football association (CBF) visited the Home of FIFA today (Friday, 13 April 2007) to hand over the Bidding Agreement form that needed to be submitted by 16 April 2007 in order for the country's interest in hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ to be officially confirmed. Rui Rodrigues presented the necessary documents to FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter on behalf of the Confederacao Brasileira de Futebol.

Brazil is now the only remaining candidate for the right to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ after the Colombian football association officially withdrew its candidature on 11 April. In a letter addressed to FIFA, Colombian FA president Luis H. Bedoya Giraldo stated that the Colombian FA had decided to withdraw from the bidding procedure. No reasons were given for the association's decision.

Brazil now has until the end of July 2007 to complete its bid, which must contain all of the necessary government guarantees. The next steps in the bidding procedure will involve FIFA conducting an inspection visit of Brazil in September 2007, with the inspection group required to submit its report by 1 November 2007. The FIFA Executive Committee is set to name the host nation of the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ in November 2007.
