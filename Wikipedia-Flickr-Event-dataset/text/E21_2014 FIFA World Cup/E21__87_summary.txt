One of the vital ingredients of the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ has today been confirmed, with the announcement by FIFA and Sony Music of the artists behind the event’s official song.
“The FIFA World Cup is one of the biggest events on the planet, and I look forward to dancing samba with Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez in Brazil - we are one!”“I’m honored to join Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte at the FIFA World Cup to bring the world together,” said Pitbull.
FIFA and Sony Music have enjoyed a successful partnership in the World Cup’s official music programme ever since 1994.
The tradition of an official song dates back to the 1966 FIFA World Cup™ in England with a song for the first Official Mascot, the lion “World Cup Willie”.
In 2002, the official song was “Boom” by Anastacia, and there was also an official anthem by Vangelis featuring typical Korean and Japanese sounds.
