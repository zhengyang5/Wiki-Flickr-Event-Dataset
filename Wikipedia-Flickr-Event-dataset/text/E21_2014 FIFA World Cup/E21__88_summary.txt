Lufthansa (Frankfurt) will temporarily rename 8 aircraft with “Fanhansa” titles for the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.
Fanhansa – this is not only a commitment to be a big fan of the German football team itself.
This is also a clear message to all soccer fans: No matter what game it is, Fanhansa inspires the fans and brings them to the big soccer events around the world.
As a partner of the German Football Association, Lufthansa flies the national team and numerous media representatives and many thousands of football fans to Brazil.
