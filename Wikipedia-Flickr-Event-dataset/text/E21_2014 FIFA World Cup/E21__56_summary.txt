James Rodríguez has been one of the breakout stars of the World Cup, and the 22-year-old outdid himself once again on Saturday.
The win sends Colombia on into the World Cup quarterfinals for the first time ever.
Rodríguez has played a part in seven of the Colombia’s 11 goals so far at the World Cup.
Uruguay bows out in the Round of 16 after having made the semifinals in the 2010 World Cup.
Meanwhile, Group C champion Colombia improved to 4-0 in this World Cup, surpassing its total number of wins in previous World Cups.
