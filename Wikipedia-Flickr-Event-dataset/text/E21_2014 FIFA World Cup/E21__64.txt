Luis Suarez's four-month ban for biting has been upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but they have cleared him to start training with his new Barcelona team-mates.

CAS have allowed Suarez to train after ruling that Fifa's ban from all football-related activity was "excessive".

The striker will now be eligible to play in a Barcelona shirt for the first time as soon as Monday, when they take on Mexico's Club Leon in a pre-season friendly at the Nou Camp, as it is not classed as an official match.

Suarez will finally be unveiled at the Nou Camp before the game on Monday, as he is now also free to enter stadiums after the appeal.

However, Suarez will have to wait until after his ban ends on 25 October to make his competitive debut for the Spaniards - and this remains to be the El Clasico contest against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on 26 October.

Suarez's lawyers said in a statement: "As a result [of the appeal], Suarez is now permitted to train and attend matches with his Barcelona team mates in preparation for the new season."

The Uruguayan was sent home from the World Cup in disgrace after he sank his teeth into Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini and world governing body Fifa hit him with a four-month ban from all football, a nine-match suspension from international matches, and a hefty fine.

Suarez, who joined the La Liga giants from Liverpool for £75m last month, had been unable to train with his new team-mates because of the ban.

The 27-year-old was also not allowed to be unveiled at the Nou Camp after signing.
