Nigeria: Enyeama 6.5; Ambrose 5.5, Oshaniwa 6, Oboabona 5.5 (Yobo 29, 6), Omeruo 6; Onazi 5.5, Azeez 5 (Odemwingie 69, 6.5), Mikel 5.5; Moses 4.5 (Ameobi 52, 6.5), Emenike 5.5, Musa 7.
Iran, on the other hand, came for a draw and will be delighted that they got one.
They arrived at the World Cup with more of them than any other qualifier – although it has to be pointed out that their opponents on the road to Brazil included Maldives, Qatar and Lebanon.
