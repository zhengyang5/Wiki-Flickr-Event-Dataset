It wouldn't be an international football tournament without FIFA president Sepp Blatter getting booed and that's what happened when he was introduced at the Estadio Nacional Mane Garrincha during the Confederations Cup opening ceremony. The moment was made all the more awkward when both he and Brazil president Dilma Rousseff couldn't figure out if their microphones were on and repeatedly blew into them.

You might remember that Blatter was also booed during the medal ceremony for last summer's Olympic women's football tournament at Wembley. "Stars are always booed so I'm a star, you have to take it this way," Blatter later said about the incident. "I thought that the public in the Olympic Games, they would be a little bit better educated."

I guess he feels Brazilians aren't very well educated now, either. The rest of the world, meanwhile, can see just how smart they are.
