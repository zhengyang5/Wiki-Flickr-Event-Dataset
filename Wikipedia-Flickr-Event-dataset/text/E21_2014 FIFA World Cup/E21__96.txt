More than one billion fans tuned in to watch the final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, with the competition reaching a global in-home television audience of 3.2 billion people, according to final figures from FIFA and Kantar Media.



An estimated 280 million people around the world watched matches online or on a mobile device, in a sign that more and more fans are embracing new technology for sports content.



The 2014 FIFA World Cup broke several TV audience records in key international markets, including the United States and Germany.



The final between Argentina and eventual champions Germany attracted an in-home audience of 695 million, up by 12 per cent on the 2010 final for viewers watching for 20 minutes or more. The total audience for the final, including in-home and out-of-home figures for viewers watching for at least one minute, hit 1.013 billion.



The impressive figures are a result of intense global interest in Brazil’s second hosting of the competition, and were achieved even though many matches were broadcast during the night and early hours of the morning in Asia, which is home to nearly two-thirds of the world’s population.



Broadcasters showed some 98,087 hours of match footage in total from Brazil, up 36 per cent from 2010. View the full Television Audience Report for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
