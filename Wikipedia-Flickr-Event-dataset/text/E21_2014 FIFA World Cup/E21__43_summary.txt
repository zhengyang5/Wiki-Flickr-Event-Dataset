Diego Maradona has accused Fifa of discriminating against World Cup sensations Costa Rica after seven of their players were drug tested after they qualified for the knockout stage.
He added: “This is only happening because some people are annoyed Costa Rica - and not the big teams - are going through, and so the sponsors won’t pay what they’d promised.
But seven players?
I’ve never seen something like that.”Fifa’s head of media, Delia Fischer, yesterday described the mass screening of Costa Ricans as “standard procedure”.
Testing for its biological passport programme began in March, focusing initially on those players most likely to travel to Brazil.
