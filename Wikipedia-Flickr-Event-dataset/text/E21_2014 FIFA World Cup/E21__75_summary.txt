Castrol, Official Sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, are experts in using pioneering technology and data analysis to understand the performance of their oils and have used similar expertise to create the Castrol Index, the definitive system for rating player performance.
Previously used at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2009 and 2013 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the Castrol Index uses the latest FIFA tracking technology to capture data on each player, which will then be analysed by a team of Castrol Performance Analysts.
The team of Castrol Performance Analysts crunch all the data to award each player a Castrol Index score out of 10 - the stronger the player's performance, the higher their score.
Last year, Brazil’s Fred topped the Castrol Index whilst back in 2010 it was Spain’s Sergio Ramos who came out on top.
The FIFA World Cup Castrol Index will be published at FIFA.com/castrolindex after each round of matches, so check the site from 18 June to find out which players will grab the headlines this time around.
