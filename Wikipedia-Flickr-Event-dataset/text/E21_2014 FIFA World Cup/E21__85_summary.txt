The Brazil World Cup bid team has increased its security budget as the country prepares to host the tournament for the first time since 1950, as well as next year's precursor Confederations Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.
"Security has become an ever-increasing issue for major sporting events in the past decade," the World Cup organizers said in a statement.
The last World Cup was held in South Africa, another country with crime problems.
On top of the world – Pele (top) leaps on his teammates during Brazil's 4-1 victory over Italy in the 1970 World Cup final.
Great expectations – Brazil will feel the weight of expectation when the World Cup is hosted in the country in 2014.
