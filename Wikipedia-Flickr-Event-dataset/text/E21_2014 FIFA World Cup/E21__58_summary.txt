Salvador:Extra time goals from Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku sent Belgium into the World Cup quarter-finals for first time in 28 years with a 2-1 win over the United States on Tuesday.
American keeper Tim Howard had made a string of fine saves to keep Marc Wilmots' men at bay during the 90 minutes in Salvador.
(Match Highlights | Matchcentre)However, he was finally beaten by De Bruyne's angled drive after good work from substitute Lukaku and De Bruyne then returned the favour to allow Lukaku to slam past his Everton teammate Howard.
But Belgium held on to set up a rematch of their 1986 semi-final defeat to Argentina in Brasilia on Saturday.
America were given a lifeline two minutes into the second period, though, as Green turned home Michael Bradley's chipped pass.
