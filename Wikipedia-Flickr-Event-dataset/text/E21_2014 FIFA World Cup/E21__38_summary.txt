The second day of Round of 16 action at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazilâ„¢ served up another feast for spectators around the globe.
The players gratefully received drinks, ice and damp cloths to cool themselves down and it had a revitalising effect, as immediately afterwards Mexico increased the pressure and carved out some promising openings.
Proenca also stopped the game in the second half for a few minutes in order to give the protagonists another breather.
That figure is in sight this year given the current average of 2.8 goals per game.
Incidentally, the 25 goals scored by substitutes in Brazil is already a new record, surpassing the 23 netted at Germany 2006.
