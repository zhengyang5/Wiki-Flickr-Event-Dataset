Only one team will be making their FIFA World Cup™ bow at Brazil 2014.
Bosnia and Herzegovina are those solitary debutants, and this is the second edition in succession in which all teams but one have prior World Cup experience.
Slovakia were South Africa 2010's sole first-timers while, by contrast, Germany 2006 produced no fewer than eight, including Brazil 2014 hopefuls Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire.
