A quick look at some interesting statistics to come out of the Round of 16 at the FIFA World Cup:

The numbers

8 – Number of group winners to make it to the quarter-finals. Also known as all of them. This is the first time all eight group winners have advanced to the quarter-finals.

4 – Previous champions in the quarter-finals (Brazil, Argentina, Germany, France).

2.25 – Goals-per-game average in the Round of 16, a drop from the 2.83 average in the group phase

154 – Total goals to this point in the World Cup, already surpassing the 2010 tournament. The record mark of 171 set in 1998 looks like it’s in major peril.

5 – Matches that went to extra time in the Round of 16, the most since the stage was implemented in 1986.

7 – Goals in extra time in those five matches, compared to 11 scored in normal time overall in the Round of 16.

0 – Ideas we have as to who’s going to win it. It’s anybody’s tournament.
