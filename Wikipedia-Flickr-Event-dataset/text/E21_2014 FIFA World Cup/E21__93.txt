Some 4 billion dollars will go into the coffers of FIFA at the end of the 2014 World Cup, at least 60% of that for broadcast rights, said its secretary general Jerome Valcke.

"The exact number I do not know but around four billion. Of course it's not all profit, it is commercial revenue related to the cycle not just the World Cup, but the cycle between the 2010 Cup and 2014", explained Valcke at a press conference in Rio de Janeiro.

Valcke indicated that between 60% and 65% of revenues come from the sale of broadcast rights and another 35-40% in marketing, including sponsorship on the field.

"The ratio is 60-40, 60 television, 1.5 billion (dollars) for marketing. The relationship should be 65-35", he said.

Ticket sales represent a small percentage of the income of the tournament.

The International Football Federation (FIFA) predicts that between 2011 and 2014 the agency would collect $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion would be spent.

Valcke said in an interview with the newspaper Lance! that it hasn't been decided were the profits (at least $200 million after the World Cup) would be invested.

"We need the support of the Ministry of Education and Sports. I think that it (where the profits will go) should be part of a broader discussion, with different authorities and not just FIFA and the LOC, on the profits which remain after the Cup", said the secretary.

This week, ex-Brazilian star and the current deputy Romario lamented that "Brazil will be in FIFA's hands" during the Confederations Cup which starts on June 15 and during the World Cup a year later.

"FIFA will be taking more than three billion reais ($1.5 billion) and will not be paying one single real", said the 1994 World Cup champion in an interview with the newspaper O Globo.

The 2010 South Africa World raised 3.6 billion dollars, not counting the box office revenue, and expenditures of 1.298 billion, according to FIFA.
