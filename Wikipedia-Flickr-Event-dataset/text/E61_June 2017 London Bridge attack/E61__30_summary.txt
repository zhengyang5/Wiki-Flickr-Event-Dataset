At least seven people were killed and dozens more injured after a van drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and several men then started stabbing passersby in what police said was a terrorist attack.
The incident began on London Bridge when a white transit-style van drove into a crowd of people "at about 50mph", according to witnesses.
Police said the van then drove to the nearby Borough Market where three men began attacking people.
Officers are dealing with reports of stabbings in Borough Market, where armed officers attended and shots were fired.
Streets around London Bridge and Borough Market, an area that is a major transport hub and is packed with bars and restaurants, was busy with people on a night out.
