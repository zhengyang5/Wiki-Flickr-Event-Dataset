Cressida Dick, the Scotland Yard chief, has done the full round of TV and radio interviews this morning on Saturday night's terror attack.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was "certainly a possibility" that the attacks were triggering the next one.

The rhetoric that has been coming from Daesh and other organisations has been to encourage people to take action into their own hands, to use low-tech methods, and undoubtedly when people see something which appears from their perverted point of view to be successful some people will be inspired by that, so that is most certainly a possibility.

The Commissioner also said that "all" of the recent attacks had a "primarily domestic centre of gravity".

In the five that we've foiled, and these three recent attacks, in some of them there are undoubtedly international dimensions. We will always be looking to see if anything has been directed from overseas, but I would say the majority of the threat that we are facing at the moment does not appear to be directed from overseas.

Ms Dick also told Today:

We have a very fast moving investigation, we have made a number of arrests, we have also carried out lots of searches and we have got an enormous amount of forensic material. We do have a very large intelligence database available to us through the agencies and of our own.

She said that "people will be very concerned that there have been three horrendous attacks in the last nine weeks" but said that it was inevitable that "with a large database and some very good knowledge, on occasion somebody will, as my predecessor predicted, get through and be successful and on occasion those people may have been known to the agencies before".
