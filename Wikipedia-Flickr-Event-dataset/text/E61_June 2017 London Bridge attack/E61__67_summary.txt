It was always probable that the terrorists who brought carnage to London last Saturday would have been known to the police and security services.
But it turns out that one of them had even advertised his hatred of British values and his support for Islamist extremism on a television documentary.
In the Channel 4 programme The Jihadis Next Door, Khuram Butt, one of the three men shot dead by police on London Bridge was filmed in a park with an Isil black flag.
He also attended events addressed by a preacher who has called for Sharia law in the UK and is a disciple of Omar Bakri Mohammed, the founder of al-Muhajiroun now in prison in Lebanon.
