Armed police officers open fire and shoot dead the three attackers in video footage of chaotic scenes in Borough Market.
A video shows the attackers rushing towards the police marksmen and trying to kill them, with armed officers opening fire and shooting them dead in defence of their own lives and the lives of others.
Eight officers shot the attackers dead, minutes after the three drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and then stabbed people in Borough Market, leaving eight dead.
It was filmed in Borough Market, a place popular with Londoners and tourists for an evening out, surrounded by restaurants and pubs.
The video shows chaotic scenes and the extent of danger the officers faced, as well as the callousness of the attackers as they set upon their victims.
