A Romanian chef thought on his feet when he hit an attacker over the head with a crate and let 20 terrified people into the bakery where he works during the terror attack on Borough Market.

Florin Morariu has been hailed on social media as a hero after taking in the people and apprehending the attacker.

The baker, who works at the Bread Ahead bakery in the market, told The Associated Press: "We were looking out of the window because we saw that everyone was agitated, everyone was running, people, women... they were fainting, falling and we went outside to see what was happening."
