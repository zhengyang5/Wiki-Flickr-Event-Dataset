According to the Telegraph, a former friend of one of the three dead suspects claimed one of the attackers had been radicalized while watching Dearborn cleric Ahmad Musa Jibril’s YouTube videos and said he contacted authorities after becoming concerned over his friend’s extremist views.
I told him about our conversation and why I think he was radicalized.”The suspected attacker was not arrested and was allowed to keep his passport.
Ahmad Jibril was sentenced to 5 years and 10 months in prison; his father, to 4 years and 10 months.
London police said officers killed the attackers within eight minutes of arriving at the scene.
