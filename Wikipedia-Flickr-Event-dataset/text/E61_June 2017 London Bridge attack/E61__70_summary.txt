One London Bridge terrorist, Khuram Butt, makes a brief appearance in the documentary, which focuses on three preachers who are well known to police and in England.
There is no indication that any of the men listed above had anything to do with the London Bridge attacks, however.
The incident unfolded at about 10:08 p.m. on June 3, as Londoners were enjoying a Saturday evening near London Bridge.
In the London Bridge attacks, armed police rushed to the scene, and gunshots broke out.
