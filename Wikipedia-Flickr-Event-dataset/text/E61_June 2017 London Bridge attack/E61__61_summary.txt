He was a British citizen and had lived in east London for a number of years.
"Khuram Butt called me a 'Murtad', which means traitor in Arabic, and accused me of being a government stooge when I confronted Anjem Choudary about him supporting terrorism," he says.
"The police turned up and Anjem, Khuram Butt and two other men were escorted away.
I am not surprised that Khuram Butt carried out the terrorist attack and there are serious questions for the authorities."
