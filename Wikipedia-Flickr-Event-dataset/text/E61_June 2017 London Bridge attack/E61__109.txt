China on Monday condemned the recent terrorist attacks in London, expressing condolences to the bereaved families, and pledging to work with the international community to fight terrorism.

"The Chinese side has expressed sympathy to the British side through diplomatic channels," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying at a daily press briefing.

Hua said the recent terrorist attacks in Britain showcased the severe challenges terrorism poses to the world.

"China is firmly opposed to terrorism of any kind, and is ready to enhance cooperation with the international community, including Britain, to fight terrorism together and safeguard world peace and security, said Hua.

Hua said that the Chinese side has not received any reports of Chinese citizens killed or injured in the attacks.

The attackers drove a van at high speed into pedestrians on London Bridge on Saturday night and stabbed people in the nearby Borough Market area, which was crowded with people at the time.

. The IS group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack, British media reported Sunday, while an investigation is under way.

According to British Prime Minister Theresa May, it was the third act of deadly terrorism in Britain since March, with two attacks in London and one on the Manchester Arena two weeks ago.
