Footage has emerged of the London Bridge attackers laughing, joking and hugging as they plotted their rampage five days before the atrocity.
In CCTV footage obtained by The Times, the three men can be seen together outside a gym in Ilford, east London, five days before their murderous attack that killed eight and injured dozens.
Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, gathered shortly after midnight on 29 May at the Ummah Fitness Centre.
Appearing relaxed and smiling, Zaghba embraces Butt and Redouane shakes his hand before going their separate ways.
Ummah Fitness Centre, which operates a gender-segregated timetable and remains open until 3am for fasting Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan, said it was “shocked and saddened” by the London Bridge attack.
