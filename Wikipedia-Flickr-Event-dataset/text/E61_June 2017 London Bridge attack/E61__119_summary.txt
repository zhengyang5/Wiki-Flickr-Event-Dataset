Mark, another witness, was in the centre of London Bridge, taking pictures of Tower Bridge downstream.
A white van has been reported to have deliberately swerved into a crowd of pedestrians on London Bridge.
At least nine people were killed in the van attack on London bridge and a knife rampage by three men in nearby Borough Market.
Alex Shellum, who was in The Mudlark pub, close to London Bridge, said he saw a bleeding woman in her early 20s stagger in.
"A van came from London Bridge itself, went between the traffic light system and rammed it towards the steps", a taxi driver told the BBC.
