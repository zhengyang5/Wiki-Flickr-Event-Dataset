"Our officials will continue to provide every assistance they can to Australians affected by this shocking attack and their families," Mr Turnbull said.
"We have conveyed our condolences to the UK government through our officials," Mr Turnbull said in a subsequent statement.
"Australians should be reassured that our agencies are today, as every day, working relentlessly to keep Australians safe," he added.
