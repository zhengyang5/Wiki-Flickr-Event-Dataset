Large numbers of police then arrived at the block of flats on Sunday after the attack.

Another couple living in the same block, just a few hundred yards from where another attacker, Khuram Butt lived, also told the Telegraph that Redouane had visited on Saturday evening.

The couple, who were aged in their 20s and wished to remain anonymous, said that the man had then left the apartment block and had signed out at reception.

The man said: “The whole block is talking about it, about he came to say goodbye to her and his daughter before they left.

“The police came yesterday morning, there were dozens of them. We know he signed out at reception because guests visiting have to.

“He was here just before it all happened.”

Redouane and his wife are reported to have split up over their differing views on religion, after they clashed over the best way to raise their child.

Redouane is listed on his daughter’s birth certificate as Moroccan and gives his profession as pastry chef. However police said he also claimed to be Libyan and has in the past used the name Rachid Elkhdar, claiming to be six years younger.

Redouane was not known to the security services, according to a police statement.
