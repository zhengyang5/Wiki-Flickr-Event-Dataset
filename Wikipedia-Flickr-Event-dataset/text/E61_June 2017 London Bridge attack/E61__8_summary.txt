Isis has claimed responsibility for the London terror attack through its Amaq 'news agency'.
Amaq's statement quoted 'sources', a phrase usually used for attacks inspired, rather than directly commissioned, by Isis.
The group, which also claimed responsibility for the Manchester attack two weeks ago, has called on its followers to carry out increased terror attacks around the world during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Analysts have warned that as Isis continues to lose swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria, it will increasingly turn to international terror attacks as a way of maintaining momentum.
Isis has lost most of Mosul in Iraq – the centre of the self-declared Caliphate since Isis captured the city in 2014 – which Iraqi security forces have been assaulting for seven months.
