Two addresses in east London are being searched by police in connection with Saturday's deadly terror attack in the capital.
Pedestrians were mowed down by a van on London Bridge before attackers stabbed a police officer and revellers around Borough Market with 12-inch knives.
“She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death.”Network Rail said London Bridge rail and London Underground stations reopened at 5am but the rail station will be exit only.
Witnesses to Saturday's attack said the terrorists deliberately drove into pedestrians on London Bridge shortly after 10pm - in the same way as Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood.
Officers are dealing with reports of stabbings in Borough Market, where armed officers attended and shots were fired.
