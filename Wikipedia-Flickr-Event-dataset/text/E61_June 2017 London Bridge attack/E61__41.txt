The account of the Bologna prosecutor Giuseppe Amato appears to have been confirmed by Zaghba’s Italian mother. Valeria Collina told journalists police officers had followed her son every time he was in Italy.

“I think they’ve done incredible work. They knew well how worried I was and aware of what was going on,” she said, according to an account published by Ansa.

Collina, also told reporters who had camped outside her apartment in the outskirts of Bologna that she had told police to make sure and not allow her son to travel to Istanbul after he was stopped by them last year.

She described a young man who was rigid and struggling, and whose worst fear at one point was that he would be arrested. But after police stopped him at a Bologna airport last year on his way to Syria via Istanbul, Collina claimed she warned her son that he needed to get himself back on the right track.

She warned him not to look at images on the internet that could be controversial and to “get to know the right people”. Ultimately she was heartened by the fact that he was a hard worker at the restaurant where he worked as a cook and waiter.

“It made me calm,” she told reporters.
