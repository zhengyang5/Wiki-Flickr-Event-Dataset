A TV showdown between the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has been postponed in response to the London Bridge terror attack, the BBC has confirmed.
National campaigning was suspended by all major parties, except Ukip, in the wake of the atrocity, with the broadcaster announcing plans to shift its Question Time Leaders Special to Monday - just days before the June 8 election.
A number of leader’s interviews with the BBC’s Andrew Neil were postponed during this time, including his clash with Mr Farron.
A BBC spokeswoman said: “The Question Time Leaders Special with Nicola Sturgeon and Tim Farron planned for 5.55pm today will make way for a BBC news special on the London Bridge attack.
The BBC cancelled its pre-election edition of the influential Andrew Marr Show, which had been due to feature election interviews with Mr Farron, Brexit Secretary David Davis and shadow chancellor John McDonnell.
