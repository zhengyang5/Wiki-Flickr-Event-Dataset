Theresa May has said the attacks in London on Saturday night are being treated as "a potential act of terrorism".

The Prime Minister rushed back to Downing Street after being alerted to the incidents and was briefed by security officials. She is due to hold a Cobra meeting expected to include cabinet ministers and intelligence chiefs "early" on Sunday morning. It is understood the Prime Minister was in her constituency of Maidenhead, Berkshire, when she was told of the news.

In a statement issued shorty after midnight, Mrs May said: “Following updates from police and security officials, I can confirm that the terrible incident in London is being treated as a potential act of terrorism.

“This is a fast moving investigation. I want to express my huge gratitude to the police and emergency services who are on the scene. Our thoughts are with those who are caught up in these dreadful events.”
