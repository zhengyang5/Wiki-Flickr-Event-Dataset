Political campaigning would resume in full on Monday, she said, after most parties suspended national campaigns.
Seven people were killed in the attack near London Bridge, the third terrorist attack in the UK in three months.
The prime minister gave a statement after chairing a meeting of senior ministers and security chiefs in the government's emergency Cobra committee on Sunday morning.
"But violence can never be allowed to disrupt the democratic process, so those campaigns will resume in full tomorrow and the general election will go ahead as planned on Thursday."
