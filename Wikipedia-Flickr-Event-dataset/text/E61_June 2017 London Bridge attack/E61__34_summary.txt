This is where the public's "Blue Thunder" moniker for the unit comes from.
Britain's shadowy, top tier counter-terror unit sprung into action during the dastardly van and knife attack on civilians in London on Saturday night.
Still, the "Blue Thunder" quick reaction alert sub-unit of 22 SAS seems to be at the very tip of the Crown's counter-terror spear.
The UK media has mentioned that "Blue Thunder" helicopters and the SAS counter-terror unit they support can operate with British Army Apache Ah1 Attack Helicopters.
But hopefully we won't have see "Blue Thunder" again any time soon.
