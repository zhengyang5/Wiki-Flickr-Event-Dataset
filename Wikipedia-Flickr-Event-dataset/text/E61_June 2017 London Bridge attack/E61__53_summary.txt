June 7 (UPI) -- London's Metropolitan Police said specialists recovered the body of an eighth victim, identified as 45-year-old French national Xavier Thomas, from the River Thames following the London Bridge attack.
Met Police said Marine Police Unit specialist officers recovered the body Tuesday night near Limehouse, about 2 miles away from London Bridge.
Detectives previously appealed for the public's help to locate Thomas, who had not been seen since the attack on Saturday.
The barriers, made of concrete and metal, were placed on Lambeth Bridge, London Bridge, Waterloo Bridge and Westminster Bridge, where a similar attack occurred in March.
The London Bridge attack occurred a week after the Manchester Arena bombing in which 23 people, including the bomber, died following a concert.
