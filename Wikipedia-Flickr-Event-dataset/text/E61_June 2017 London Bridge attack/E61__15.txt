Japan has warned its nationals to avoid places it says could be “potential targets” in London, including sightseeing spots, department stores, markets, concert venues and political rallies.

The country’s foreign ministry said in a travel advisory that Japanese visitors to Britain should “pay close attention to their surroundings, and leave quickly if they see anything suspicious”.

The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has voiced solidarity with the British people in a message to Theresa May. Abe offered his condolences to the victims of Saturday’s attack, adding: “I express solidarity with the people of Britain at this difficult time.”

Abe said: “Japan is determined to fight terrorism, working hand in hand with Britain and other members of the international community.”
