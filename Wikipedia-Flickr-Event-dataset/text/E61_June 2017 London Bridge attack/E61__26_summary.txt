Wayne Marques swung at terrorists despite temporarily losing sight in one eye when he was stabbed in headA police officer has told how he fought off the three London Bridge attackers with his baton despite being temporarily blinded in one eye after he was stabbed in the head.
“He’d hit me so hard that my right eye went lights out straight away, I just went blind,” Marques told the Press Association.
“The second one [attacker] and the third one I was basically fighting left to right, because I only had one eye so I’m moving left to right, left to right,” he said.
Marques was wounded just above his right eye and also suffered major injuries to his head, left leg and left hand.
They deliberately drove a white van into people on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market, where all three were shot dead by police.
