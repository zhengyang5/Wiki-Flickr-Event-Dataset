Police have raided a block of flats in east London where they made twelve arrests in connection with the terror attack on London Bridge.

Armed officers stormed flats in Kings Road, Barking, around 7am on Sunday, just hours after three suspects launched a horrific attack on the capital, killing seven people and injuring 48.

A white van mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge shortly after 10pm before the attackers, wielding knives and a machete and wearing fake suicide vests, stabbed revellers enjoying nights out in nearby Borough Market.

The attackers were shot dead by police marksmen just eight minutes after terrified bystanders dialled 999.

Scotland Yard confirmed a further 12 people were arrested in connection with the atrocity during the raids at the flats in east London,

One resident said police showed him a photo of one of the slain terror attackers. The witness, Damien Pettit, said he “looked a lot like their neighbour”.

Mr Pettit told Sky News he could not be certain it was the same person, but that it looked like a man who had lived in the block for three years and previously worked for TfL.

Mr Pettit said: "If it is, I am completely shocked. He was lived here for three years.

"He is a member of the community, it very much is that, a very affable person so it is a complete shock."

Adding that the man he knew had children, he continued: "I am kind of absorbing this at the moment because I can't understand how it could have been him.

"He has always tried to help in terms of what is going on in the area.

"He always sets up community groups in terms of the homelessness that is happening here, so to hear that he is now complicit with this, it is very hard to stomach."

Mr Pettit said the man had a London accent, had also worked at a local gym.

Veronica Oladapo, 45, who lives in the neighbouring Forresters Apartments, said she left her building at around 7am to see police taking four men and a woman away.

She said she saw two men and a woman being taken away by ambulance after other neighbours reported hearing shots fired, while two men were later led away by police.

She said: "When I came out they were already taking some of the casualties away.

"There were three of them ... the ambulance came and took them away.

"There were another two sitting down inside."

One of the men had a hood pulled over his head while another one used a jacket to hide his face, she said.

Another witness said that more than five hours after the first arrests, a woman in a burka was led into a police van parked outside the flats.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed that an off-duty officer and a British Transport Police officer were among those injured in the attack.

Both remain in hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Londoners and tourists have been urged to remain vigilant and report anything deemed to suspicious to the anti-terrorism hotline on 0800 789 321.
