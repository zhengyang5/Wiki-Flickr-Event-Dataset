The terrorists had also used cord to strap the knives to their hands to ensure they did not drop them as they attacked innocent bystanders.

Mr Haydon said it remained a fast moving investigation, but said police now had a clearer understanding of the movements of the terrorists on the day in question.

He said: â€œButt had earlier tried to hire a 7.5 tonne lorry but did not provide payment details and the rental never went ahead. My view at the moment is that he then went to plan B and ended up hiring the van instead."

He appealed to haulage companies to inform the police if they came across people who were trying to hire lorries without the correct paperwork.

After being unsuccessful in his bid to hire a 7.5 tonne truck, Butt, who was on bail for a fraud offence at the time of the attack, used a recently activated mobile phone to book the hire van, requesting it between the hours of 5.50pm on Saturday and 10am on the Sunday.
