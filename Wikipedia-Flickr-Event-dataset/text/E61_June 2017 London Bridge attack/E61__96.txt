David Anderson has agreed to provide independent assurance of the internal reviews by MI5 and the police into the recent terror attacks in London and Manchester. This will give the Home Secretary and the National Security Council confidence that all the relevant questions in relation to what was known and done before the attacks have been addressed, and the appropriate conclusions drawn.
