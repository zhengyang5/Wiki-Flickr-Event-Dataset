The mother of London Bridge terrorist Youssef Zaghba has said she "feels the pain" of her son's victims and their families.

Zaghba first came to the attention of the Italian authorities in March 2016 when he was detained at Bologna Airport.
The Italian authorities have told the media how Zaghba said he was "going to be a terrorist" but his mother insists that was a misunderstanding.
Giuseppe Amato, the Italian prosecutor who investigated Zaghba told me that he was considered a sympathiser, rather than someone who had committed an offence.
