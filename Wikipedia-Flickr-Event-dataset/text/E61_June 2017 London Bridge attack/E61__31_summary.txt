Cressida Dick, the Scotland Yard chief, has done the full round of TV and radio interviews this morning on Saturday night's terror attack.
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was "certainly a possibility" that the attacks were triggering the next one.
The Commissioner also said that "all" of the recent attacks had a "primarily domestic centre of gravity".
In the five that we've foiled, and these three recent attacks, in some of them there are undoubtedly international dimensions.
We do have a very large intelligence database available to us through the agencies and of our own.
