Large numbers of police then arrived at the block of flats on Sunday after the attack.
Another couple living in the same block, just a few hundred yards from where another attacker, Khuram Butt lived, also told the Telegraph that Redouane had visited on Saturday evening.
The man said: “The whole block is talking about it, about he came to say goodbye to her and his daughter before they left.
“The police came yesterday morning, there were dozens of them.
Redouane is listed on his daughter’s birth certificate as Moroccan and gives his profession as pastry chef.
