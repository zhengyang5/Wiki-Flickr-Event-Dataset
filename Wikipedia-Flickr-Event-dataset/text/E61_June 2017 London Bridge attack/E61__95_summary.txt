Theresa May has just delivered a speech outside Downing Street which sounded an awful lot like campaigning.
Shortly before 10 past 10 yesterday evening, the Metropolitan Police received reports that a white van had stuck pedestrians on London Bridge.
It continued to drive from London bridge to Borough Market where three terrorists left the van and attacked innocent and unarmed civilians with blades and knives.
In moving away from the circumstances of the attack and towards what our response should be, May is effectively campaigning.
Perhaps that is fine: itâ€™s perfectly fair and right that we should have an argument about how to response to the London Bridge attacks.
