SINGAPORE - Singapore has condemned Saturday (June 3) night's vicious knife and van attacks in London and expressed condolences to the families of the victims.

"There can be no justification for such attacks against innocent civilians," said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement.

"We express our deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and wish the injured a speedy recovery. We stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom."

The Singapore High Commission in London has reached out to Singaporeans who are e-registered in London. The High Commission is also working closely with the London authorities to monitor the situation.

Thus far, there have been no reports of Singaporeans directly affected by or injured in the incidents, said the MFA.

Singaporeans in the United Kingdom are advised to keep in touch with their family and friends. Those who are in need of urgent consular assistance should contact the Singapore High Commission in London or MFA Duty Office at:
