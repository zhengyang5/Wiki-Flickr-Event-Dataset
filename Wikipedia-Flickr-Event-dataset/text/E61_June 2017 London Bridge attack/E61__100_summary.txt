Labour said it had suspended its national campaign after consultation with other parties, with the election four days away.
The Liberal Democrats said they had also suspended national campaigning, as did the Greens.

I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.‚ÄùThe Scottish National party, Scottish Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrat leaders cancelled national campaign events planned for Sunday.
