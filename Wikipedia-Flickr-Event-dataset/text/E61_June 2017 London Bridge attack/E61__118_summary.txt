AMMAN — Jordan on Sunday condemned the terrorist attacks that targeted civilians in London on Saturday, killing several people and injuring many others, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported.
Momani, who is also the government’s spokesperson, said that Jordan stands by the UK in facing terrorist groups, calling for unifying international efforts to combat terrorism.
He extended the government’s condolences to the British government and the families of the victims, wishing the injured a speedy recovery, Petra reported.
At least 48 people were injured in the attack, the third to hit Britain in less than three months, occurring days ahead of a snap parliamentary election on Thursday.
