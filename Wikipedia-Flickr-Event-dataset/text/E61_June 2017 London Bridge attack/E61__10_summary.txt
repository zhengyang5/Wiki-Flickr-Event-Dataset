British authorities are investigating the third major terror attack in the UK in under three months.
Seven people were killed and nearly 50 injured in a series of coordinated attacks in London on Saturday night.
Police believe all of the attackers were killed in the latest attack, but investigations are underway to ensure there are no more.
It took a familiar, horrifying form: as with the Westminster attack in March, a van was driven at speed – apparently on the wrong side of the road – into crowds of people.
The vehicle continued to drive then from London Bridge to Borough Market.
