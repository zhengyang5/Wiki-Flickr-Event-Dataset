Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led a forceful Israeli response to the terrorist attack in London on Saturday night, in which seven people were killed and nearly 50 wounded by three Islamists who were then shot dead by armed police.

In a series of tweets following the attacks on pedestrians on London Bridge and nearby Borough Market, Netanyahu pledged to “fight…this scourge that knows no bounds.” The Israeli Prime Minister is currently attending the summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the Liberian capital Monrovia.

“London Bridge will not fall. Together we will vanquish terror,” Netanyahu declared.

These terrorists worship death. They murder indiscriminately, but they will not frighten us.

They will not terrorize us. — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) June 4, 2017

British Prime Minister Theresa May – who is campaigning for re-election in Thursday’s general election – emphasized the threat from Islamist ideology in her condemnation of Saturday night’s attack.

May said that the terrorists were “bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism that preaches hatred, sows division, and promotes sectarianism. It is an ideology that claims our Western values and freedom, democracy and human rights are incompatible with the religion of Islam.”

Asserting that “enough is enough,” May called for increased domestic counterterrorism measures. “We cannot and must not pretend that things can remain the same,” the prime minister said.
