Giuseppe Amato, the chief prosecutor in Bologna, told the Guardian that information about the risk Zaghba posed was shared with officials in the UK after he had tried to travel from Italy to join Islamic State in Syria in March 2016.
Zaghba’s Pakistani-born co-conspirator, Khuram Butt, 27, was investigated by British police in 2015, but he was also considered a low priority.
Italy’s national police chief, Franco Gabrielli, said on Wednesday that he felt in “a position of strength” on the Zaghba issue.
She confirmed that Zaghba was followed by Italian counter-terrorism officers during his visits.
Amato said Zaghba had been placed on a Europe-wide watch list known as the second generation Schengen information system.
