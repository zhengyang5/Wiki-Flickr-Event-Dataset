Rachid Redouane was the second of the three jihadi attackers who killed seven people in London on Saturday.
Rachid RedouaneRedouane was Moroccan-Libyan pastry chef who had until recently been living in Dublin.
He is thought to have settled in Dublin about five years ago but does not appear to have come to the authorities’ notice before Saturday night’s terror attack.
Irish security sources confirmed the terrorist married a British woman in Dublin in 2012 and lived in Rathmines, Dublin.
Among those arrested in London on Sunday were Charisse O’Leary (38), the mother of Redouane’s 18-month-old daughter.
