London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Saturday described the London bridge attack as "deliberate and cowardly," and said it targeted "innocent Londoners."

Khan, Londonâ€™s first Muslim mayor, made the remarks after a van crashing into a crowd at London Bridge and a series of stabbings nearby, police confirmed -- just the latest attacks to strike the United Kingdom in recent weeks.

"This was a deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners and visitors to our city enjoying their Saturday night," Khan said. "I condemn it in the strongest possible terms. There is no justification whatsoever for such barbaric acts."

Six people were killed in the attack, and three suspects were shot by police, authorities said. Witnesses told Sky News and the BBC that the attackers shouted "This is for Allah."
