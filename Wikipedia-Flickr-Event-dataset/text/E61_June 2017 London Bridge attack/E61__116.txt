A massive emergency operation is in place in the city after multiple casualties were reported after two separate terror incidents.

Terrible news coming from London - we stand with our close neighbours again tonight. @IrelandEmbGB monitoring the situation.

Police were called at around 10.08pm to reports of a vehicle hitting pedestrians on London Bridge.

Officers then attended a second incident at nearby Borough Market after reports of stabbings. Armed officers responded and shots were fired.
