Police have raided a block of flats in east London where they made twelve arrests in connection with the terror attack on London Bridge.
Armed officers stormed flats in Kings Road, Barking, around 7am on Sunday, just hours after three suspects launched a horrific attack on the capital, killing seven people and injuring 48.
A white van mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge shortly after 10pm before the attackers, wielding knives and a machete and wearing fake suicide vests, stabbed revellers enjoying nights out in nearby Borough Market.
