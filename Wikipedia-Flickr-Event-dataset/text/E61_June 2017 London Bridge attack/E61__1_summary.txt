Detectives have released photos of the London Bridge terrorists' blood-spattered fake suicide belts and say the killers may have wanted to take hostages.
He said: "I have not seen this tactic in the UK before where terrorists create maximum fear by strapping fake explosives to themselves.
"It makes the bravery of those police officers and members of the public who tackled the terrorists even more remarkable.
"The terrorists were coming in and I saw that they looked like they had suicide vests on," he said.
"Information came over the radio that they were wearing suicide vests."
