A mission of the United Nations Security Council visited EUFOR last week in order to assess the situation in the Central African Republic.
This decision created the legal basis for the operation entitled EUFOR RCA and was another step towards its rapid deployment.
The Former EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, Catherine Ashton, said: "We have reacted swiftly to the serious crisis in the Central African Republic.
EUFOR RCA will deploy as soon as possible to back the remarkable efforts of France and our African partners."
General Jean Marc Bacquet [427 KB] was appointed as Force Commander of the European Union military mission in the Central African Republic on December 2014.
