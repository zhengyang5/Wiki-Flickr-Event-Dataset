Fifty Estonian soldiers set off this morning from the Ã„mari airbase to the Central African Republic to join the EU's EUFOR RCA mission.
The troops, led by Lieutenant Colonel Sten Allik, will be based in the nation's capital, Bangui (population 750,000), and will take part in support missions allowing African Union and French units to take part in operations.
The EUFOR RCA mission will have around 1,000 soldiers when in full force, but 2,000 French and 6,000 African Union troops are also in the country.
Sectarian violence broke out in the Central African Republic last year, leading to ethnic violence that has seen nearly the entire Muslim population to flee the capital.
At least 2,000 people have been killed in the country since March 2013, when Muslim rebels, known as Seleka, ousted President Francois Bozize.
