ABIDJAN (Reuters) - A rebel leader in Central African Republic has declared an autonomous state in his northeastern stronghold after rejecting elections this month that are aimed at ending years of bloodshed, his spokesman said on Tuesday.
“The Republic of Logone was proclaimed Dec. 14 in (the town of) Kaga-Bandoro,” Maouloud Moussa, a spokesman and chief lieutenant for rebel leader Noureddine Adam, told Reuters.
Then we’ll look at how to move towards independence.”The spokesman for Central African Republic’s transitional government immediately denounced the rebels’ declaration.
“We call upon the international community and the international forces present in Central African Republic to do everything possible to neutralize the capacity to do harm of these terrorists,” said Dominique Said Panguindji.
He had called for the referendum and polls scheduled for Dec. 27 to be canceled, but voting went ahead yesterday under U.N. protection.
