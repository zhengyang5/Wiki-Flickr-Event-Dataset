According to reports, some South African soldiers were captured by rebel forces.
Boziz√© told Zuma that the rebels had given him a 72-hour ultimatum to vacate the presidential palace.
Although the competence of South African soldiers is not in question, the force was ill-equipped for war, unlike the rebels.
"For some reason, this time was quite different and Dirco woke up to find that South African troops had been deployed to CAR," said a source.
Holomisa said South African soldiers were "an irritation" to the people of the CAR.
