BANGUI (Reuters) - Central African Republic’s embattled President Francois Bozize said on Sunday he was ready to share power with the leaders of a rebellion that has swept aside government defenses to within striking distance of the capital.
“Know that Seleka’s aim today is not to enter into a government but to allow the people of Central African Republic to be able to drive the country towards development and self-fulfillment,” he said.
The last time rebels reached Bangui was in 2003 during the insurgency that swept Bozize to power.
The Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)already has more than 500 peacekeepers in CAR.
