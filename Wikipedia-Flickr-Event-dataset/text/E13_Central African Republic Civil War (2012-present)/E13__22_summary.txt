BANGUI (Reuters) - Central African Republic’s army chiefs pledged allegiance to the country’s self-proclaimed president Michel Djotodia on Thursday as the ex-rebel leader consolidated control four days after his fighters seized the capital.
Fighters of the Seleka rebel coalition stand in front of the presidential palace in Bangui March 25, 2013.
“All the former chiefs of police, gendarmes, the head of the armed forces and other senior officers came to the meeting.
“One of them put a bullet into the chamber, which was a terrifying moment, and I gave them everything.”Bangui resident Henriette Dobozo said rebel fighters came to her family’s business.
South African media and a senior Ugandan officer said South African soldiers gathered in Uganda on Thursday for a “new mission” to Central African Republic.
