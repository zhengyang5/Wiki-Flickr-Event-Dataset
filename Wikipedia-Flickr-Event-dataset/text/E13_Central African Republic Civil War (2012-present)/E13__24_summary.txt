The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all travel to the Central African Republic at this time.
As a result of the deteriorating security situation, the U.S. Embassy in Bangui suspended its operations on December 28, 2012, and therefore cannot provide protection or routine consular services to U.S. citizens in the Central African Republic.
U.S. citizens in CAR who seek consular assistance should contact the Office of Overseas Citizens Services at CARemergencyUSC@state.gov.
If you are going to live in or travel to the Central African Republic despite this Travel Warning, please take the time to tell us about your trip by enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).
For information on general crime and security issues, you should also consult the Department of Stateâ€™s Country Specific Information of Central African Republic as well as The Worldwide Caution located on the Bureau of Consular Affairs website.
