Central African Republic's new Prime Minister Andre Nzapayeke has said that his priority would be to stop the massacres and other atrocities that have shaken the country for months.
Speaking a day after he was named prime minister, Nzapayeke, a former banking official, said on Sunday that ending the violence between Christians and Muslims was the key to restoring security and a functioning state.
"I am going to be speaking with the different groups so that we immediately stop certain... atrocities being carried out in this country.
We have to put a stop to all that quickly," Nzapayeke said in an interview with French radio station RFI.
The new prime minister said he planned to "put a team in place that's going to deal with the question of national reconciliation".
