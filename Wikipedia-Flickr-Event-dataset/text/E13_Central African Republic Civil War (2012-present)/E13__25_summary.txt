Attacks on several cities by the coalition of rebel groups known as "Seleka" undermine peace agreements in the Central African Republic; rebels say they are fighting because the government has broken promises.
The Central African Republic government is seeking negotiations with the rebels in Libreville, Gabon, he said.
In the meantime, troops from the Central African Multinational Forces were expected to arrive to bolster security in the capital, he said.
The desire for negotiation was reiterated in a statement released on behalf of Bozize by the Central African Republic Foreign Ministry.
The Central African Republic came into being after the French colony known as Ubangi-Shari gained independence in 1960.
