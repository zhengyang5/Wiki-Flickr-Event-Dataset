NEW YORK - United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for more military deployment in the Central African Republic to prevent the restive nation from a dangerous partition on communal lines between Christians and Muslims.
Our vow of never again is meaningless without the political, military and financial muscle to back it up," Ban said.
Ban also stressed that the country needs tangible support for the Central African Republic government, the start of a reconciliation process and financial support for the vast humanitarian needs.
The crisis in the Central African Republic has already claimed thousands of lives, uprooted almost one million people and left more than 2.5 million people in need of immediate humanitarian assistance.
The UN chief said he would soon return to the Security Council with specific recommendations for a UN peacekeeping mission with "a robust mandate to protect civilians".
