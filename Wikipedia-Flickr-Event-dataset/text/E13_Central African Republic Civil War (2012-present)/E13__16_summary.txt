The Central African Republic (CAR) has been rocked by unrest since rebels known as Seleka, or alliance, seized power and overthrew the government.
There have also been an increasing number of attacks by a group called Anti-Balaka, which is fighting the Seleka rebels.
Other people say they are former members of the Central African army and loyal to Francois Bozize, who was president of the CAR until he was toppled in a coup in March.
Their main target appears to be the former Seleka rebels who are now in the security forces.
