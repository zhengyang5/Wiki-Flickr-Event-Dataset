REUTERS/Stringer (SOUTH AFRICA - Tags: MILITARY POLITICS OBITUARY)Johannesburg - The deployment of South African troops to the Central African Republic (CAR) is a “scandal” that may “dwarf” any of President Jacobs Zuma’s past indiscretions.
Zille’s statement follows a week of outrage and a “shroud of secrecy” after the 13 South African soldiers were killed and scores of others injured in the CAR.

“Most disturbing with the accusation are the blatant lies that suggest a company linked to the ANC has business interests in CAR.
