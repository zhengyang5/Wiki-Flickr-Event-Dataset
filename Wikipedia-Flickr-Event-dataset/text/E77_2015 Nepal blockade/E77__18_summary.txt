The first Indian casualty takes the cumulative death toll in the 40-day standoff to nearly 50, all the rest being Nepali Madhesis.
The Government of India’s spokesperson noted Monday, “Issues facing Nepal are political in nature and cannot be resolved by force.
Whereas not long ago there was only one Madhesi political party – Sadbhavana party – during the peak of Madhesi political power, the four-party United Democratic Madhesi Front had garnered 84 seats in the first Constituency Assembly becoming virtual kingmakers.
One Madhesi leader told me: ‘Goli pani khayo, gaali pani khayo’ (We have faced bullets as well as abuse).
There is, therefore, good reason why Oli is not well-disposed to Madhesi political grievances.
