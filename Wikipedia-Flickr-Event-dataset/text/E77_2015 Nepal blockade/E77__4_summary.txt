Those who are referred to as Madhesis number around 56 lakh (2011 Census).
Tharus do not like to be called Madhesis, and those of Hill origin are still identified as Pahadis.
The Madhesis have castes and ethnicity similar to Bihar and eastern UP, with frequent inter-marriages between families on either side of the border.
From the 50s onward, some ministerial or key constitutional posts have gone to Madhesis.
The Madhesis themselves have been wracked at times by a tussle between ‘migrant Madhesis’ and the ‘Dhartiputras of Madhes’.
