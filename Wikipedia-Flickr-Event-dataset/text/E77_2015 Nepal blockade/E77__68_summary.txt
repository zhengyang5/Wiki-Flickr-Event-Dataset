Discussing the multilateral dimension of the blockade between Nepal and India, Tofail Ahmed, Minister of Commerce, Bangladesh, told The Hindu that the blockade which has been hurting Nepalâ€™s economy, should end at the earliest.
Speaking from Bangladesh, Mr. Ahmed noted that Bangladesh has been tracking the development but has so far avoided commenting.
BBIN was meant to facilitate movement of commercial vehicles across the borders of Bhutan, Nepal, India and Bangladesh.
Mr. Ahmed is one of the leading liberal politicians of Bangladesh and was groomed by founder of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
But Bangladeshi truck owners, ports and companies might also get affected negatively if the blockade continues against Nepal.
