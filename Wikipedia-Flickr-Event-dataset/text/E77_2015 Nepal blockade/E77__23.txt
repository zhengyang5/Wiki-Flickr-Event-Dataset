Sep 30, 2015-The government has decided not to distribute petroleum products to private vehicles starting from Thursday in view of deepening fuel crisis following ‘unofficial blockade’ imposed by India.

Representatives of Home Ministry, Supply Ministry and security agencies took the decision during a meeting held on Wednesday.

All private vehicles including school buses, tipper and truck will not be allowed to refill fuel three days from tomorrow, according to spokesperson at the Home Ministry Laxmi Prasad Dhakal. However, government and vehicles hauling edible products will be allowed to fuel.

“The government took the decision to ease the shortage,” said Dhakal “The duration may be prolonged if the situation persists.”

The government had earlier introduced quota system for fuel distribution.
