It shook me to the core and drove me to carry out a small survey of my own to find out the impact of the blockade on medical services.
I met a few concerned doctors and hospital authorities as well to collect information about the difficulties they faced due to fuel shortage resulting from the blockade by India.
Doctors and nurses must continue to be provided with fuel or regular pick up and drop service for smooth medical services.
By preventing the entry of medical supplies and fuel, India has imposed an inhuman blockade on Nepal.
Kathmandu has been parlaysed due to over 16 days of blockade.
