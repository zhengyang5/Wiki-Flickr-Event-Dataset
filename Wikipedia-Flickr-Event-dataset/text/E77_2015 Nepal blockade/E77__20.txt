Oct 1, 2015-Nepal Workers and Peasants Party Chairman Narayan Man Bijukchhe has said that government was on verge of signing a deal to import fuel from China during the premiership of late Nepali Congress leader Girija Prasad Koirala. Without specifying the year, Bijukchhe said that the agrreement was never signed after Indian Ambassdor to Nepal warned against it.

“When Girija Prasad Koirala was Nepal’s Prime Minister, Nepal and China reached an understanding for China to supply petroleum products to Nepal for five years via Tatopani trade point,” said Bijukche, “However, the immediate threat from Indian ambassador jeopardised the agreement. Now is the time to revive the agreement and take initiatives to import fuel from China at the earliest.”

Leader Bijukche made the remark following his meeting with CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli. Chairman Oli had reached Bijukche’s residence in Kamalbinayak, Bhaktapur today for political consultations.
