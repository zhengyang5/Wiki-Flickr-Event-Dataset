Nepalese policemen use tear gas to disperse ethnic Madhesi protesters in Gaur, a town about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunday, Dec.20, 2015.

The first steps towards a resolution of the conflict between the government and the Madhesis was critical.
India’s statement that the government’s ‘positive steps that will help create the basis for resolution of the current impasse in Nepal,” were welcomed.
Madhesi front leaders will formulate their response to the new situation — one they had not anticipated –but the chances of their going against the new camaraderie between two governments is unlikely.
