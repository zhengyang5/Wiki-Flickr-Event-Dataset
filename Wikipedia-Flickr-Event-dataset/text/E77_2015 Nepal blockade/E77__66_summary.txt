The Secretary General Ban has asked all sides to lift the obstructions of essential supplies on the Nepal-India border without further delay, the English daily quoted Ban's spokesperson as saying.
"Acute shortages in fuel supplies have continued to impede deliveries to earthquake-affected villages in Nepal."
Nepal terms it a blockade being in place for more than a month and says it is breach of landlocked country Nepal's transit right.
Nepal is a landlocked country heavily dependent on India for trade and transit as its border with China is along the difficult terrain of the Himalayan range.
Nepal is surrounded by India in the east, west and south and by China in the north.
