Even as Home Minister Rajnath Singh asked Sashastra Seema Bal(SSB) to sharpen its spying skills, the force has called for 27 FM towers along Indo-Nepal border to counter anti-India propaganda.



Speaking at a function to mark the 52nd Raising Day here, SSB chief B D Sharma cited messages against the country’s interests being transmitted along the border areas which SSB field units have reported, reiterating the need for the FM towers to tackle “anti-India” propaganda in the 1751 kilometre long border.



Field formations have identified 27 such locations where FM radio towers could be put up, he said at the function, where the home minister was also present. Sharma said the SSB will also recruit around 2,700 women combatants over the next three years.



Singh said in his address that a robust and sharp intelligence system is the "most important weapon" along the sensitive borders which are open and not fenced, keeping in view India's friendly relations with the neighbouring countries.



“You have had a speciality that is your intelligence system. Based on your experiences and good work, you will have to make it (snoop capabilities) better so that this system is able to render a more important role in the near future,” Singh said.



“I believe that along the sensitive and open Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders, intelligence is the most important weapon for crime control," he added.



The SSB should use its snooping machinery to check "unwanted activities" on Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders so that anti-social elements and terrorist groups are not able to gather there and conduct activities against India, Singh said.



Singh said his ministry is seriously considering a proposal from the force to extend facilities available to its uniformed and armed units to the “non-uniformed” components as well.
