Drug entrepreneurs said around 400 trucks laden with medicine are stranded at various border points.
Fourteen pharmaceutical industries along the Birgung-Hetauda section stopped medicine production due to the lack of raw materials and security threats.
Prakash Khandelwal, vice-chairman of the Association of Pharmaceutical Producers, said medicine production has come to a halt due to the blockade.
Besides medicine, he said, a large quantity of medical raw materials has also been stranded at the border.
Likewise, some districts in the eastern region are also facing an acute shortage of medicine due to Tarai unrest.
