Rumours about a possible embargo started flying from Sunday, leading nervous motorists to besiege gasoline stations almost immediately.
Crowds could be seen at gasoline stations operated by Sajha and the security forces as private pumps were closed.
Gasoline dealers blamed the panic buying on NOC as it had not been issuing adequate quantities of fuel.
“Gasoline stations will start distributing this batch of fuel by Monday evening,” said Ghimire, claiming that supplies would return to normal on Tuesday.
