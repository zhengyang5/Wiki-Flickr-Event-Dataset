KATHMANDU, Nepal, 30 November 2015 – More than 3 million children under the age of 5 in Nepal are at risk of death or disease during the harsh winter months due to a severe shortage of fuel, food, medicines and vaccines, UNICEF warns.
Ambulance services across the country have been hit by the fuel shortage, resulting in a drop in births in hospitals and health centres.
UNICEF urges all sides to address the restrictions on essential imports of supplies to Nepal.
