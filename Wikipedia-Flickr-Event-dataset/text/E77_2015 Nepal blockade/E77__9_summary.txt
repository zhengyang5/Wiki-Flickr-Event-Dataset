#BackOffIndia began trending online last week, days after the long-awaited promulgation of the Nepali Constitution after 507 members of the 598-strong Constituent Assembly (CA) voted in favour of the new Constitution.
They belong to Madhes-based political parties who perceive that this constitution reneged on promises that were made to them in 2008.
The majority of its population share strong socio-cultural ties to the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
The new Constitution was expected to draw federal state lines in such a way as to enable marginalised communities to have stronger political representation.
But after eight years of political wrangling over the Constitution, the Madhesis feel that they have been short-changed.
