Sep 30, 2015-The government on Wednesday formed a committee to recommend options to fly in aviation fuel for domestic airlines amid mounting fears that the country's airlines could be grounded for lack of fuel.
Suresh Acharya, joint secretary of the Tourism Ministry, said that a meeting held between the Home and Supplies ministries, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) and Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) discussed three options to forestall an expected aviation turbine fuel (ATF) crisis by bringing fuel by air.
Using Mi-17 helicopters to transport fuel from cross-border points to oil depots in the Tarai where domestic aircraft can refuel.
The third option proposed at the meeting was to request China and the US Air Force to airlift jet fuel.
The meeting has also decided to request Nepali private helicopter companies to transport fuel.
