Kathmandu, Nov 8: The UNICEF has expressed its serious concern over the children of Nepal as the possibility of humanitarian crisis looms over.
Issuing a press statement on Saturday, Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, expressed worry over the condition of children who were scared by the April 25 massive earthquake earlier and now are reeling under national crisis, Xinhua reported.
Lake, who was in Nepal on a two-day trip, added: "The temporary shelters built after the earthquake can provide even minimal protection from the coming winter.
A new humanitarian crisis may loom."
The UNICEF has urgently appealed to all involved to think not only of the coming winter, but of the longer term future as well.
