A day after signing a first ever fuel agreement with Nepal, China said on Thursday it would continue to support Kathmandu's 'sovereignty and independence' and extend assistance, amid a continuing blockade on the Nepal-India border.
The Chinese government said it had decided to supply emergency fuel assistance after a working group from Nepal came to China for urgent talks, triggered by the continuing blockade of fuel imports from India.
"We support Nepal in its efforts for ensuring independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
According to Nepali reports, the fuel agreement was reached with China after the working group held talks in Beijing.
China earlier this month also moved to reopen its land border with Nepal at an earlier-than-expected date.
