NEW DELHI -- State-owned Indian Oil Corp. (IOC) has lost its fuel monopoly in Nepal which has signed a deal with China to import petroleum products.
Supplies have been badly affected by recent violent protests by Madhesi people who live in Nepal's fertile Terai plains bordering India.
With fuel imports from India impeded, Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) and China National United Oil Corporation (PetroChina) signed a memorandum of understanding on Oct. 28.
Nepal has no oil and has hitherto been entirely dependent on India, its largest trading partner and sole gateway to the outside world.
The Kathmandu Post reported on Friday that IOC increased fuel supplies from four border points after the Nepal-China fuel deal was signed.
