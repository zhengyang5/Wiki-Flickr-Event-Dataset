India’s “unofficial” blockade of goods on its side of the Nepal border would seem to be a successful flexing of New Delhi’s muscles to its neighor.
However, this punishing of Nepal for not addressing India’s concerns in its new constitution appears to be the first act in a diplomatic suicide.
Today, the two are not counted among India’s friends.
It was said – until recently and privately – that Nepal doesn’t take any significant political decision without India’s approval.
It was no coincidence that whoever – be it King Gyanendra or Maoist leader Prachanda – sought to counterbalance India’s influence in Nepal with that of China, lost power.
