Madhesi leaders say they are now thinking of reviewing their pressure tactics and might call off all forms of border-centric protests this weekend.
But locals have started to demand that Madhesi leaders reopen the Birganj trade point as well.
After the first amendment of the constitution last month, India has also reportedly asked Madhesi leaders to reassess their strategy.
Now he has changed his stance, and other Madhesi leaders are also expected to follow his lead.
Madhesi leaders, however, say their struggle is far from over and that they will continue to fight for their rights.
