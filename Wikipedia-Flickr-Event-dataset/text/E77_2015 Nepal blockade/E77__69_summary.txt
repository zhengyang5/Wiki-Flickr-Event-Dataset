Kathmandu, Oct 24, 2015- Chair of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, Jean Lambert, has highlighted the need for regional solidarity in this new phase of Nepal's development.
In a press statement, Lambert said, "The unofficial 'blockade' at the Nepali border only serves to hurt the Nepali people who are still recovering from the devastating earthquakes earlier this year."
She stated that the fuel shortages as a result of the blockade were also having an impact on tourism in what is usually the peak season in Nepal, causing further damage to the economy of the country and the livelihoods of many.
Lambert welcomed reports earlier this week that Prime Minister KP Oli was seeking talks with Madheshi groups to address grievances with the constitution, and called on India - as a good neighbour - to help ensure essential supplies reach Nepal and that cross-border trade is not impeded.
