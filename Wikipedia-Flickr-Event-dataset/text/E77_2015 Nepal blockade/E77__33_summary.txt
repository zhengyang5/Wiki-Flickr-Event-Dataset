The sole reason behind this turmoil is Nepal's new constitution and their lack of faith in India and more towards China, which is outrageously wrong.
They are considered by the northern Nepalese community to be Indians and not Nepalese, hence they are sidelined by the constitution.
This blockade had made Nepal economically weak and alienated it more towards China, which in fact was the real reason for the strained relation between both of us.
This actually is Nepal's undoing because it can remain free and prosperous only under India's security and economic umbrella.
They all need to generate public support and regain the trust of the people of the country by working together.
