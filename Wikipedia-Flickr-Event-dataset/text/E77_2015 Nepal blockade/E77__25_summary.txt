Story highlights Nepal is rationing fuel over shortages due to trucks not entering from IndiaIt accuses India of imposing an "unofficial trade blockade" over its new constitutionIndia denies imposing a blockade but says the constitution should be more inclusiveNew Delhi (CNN) Nepal has introduced fuel rationing because of shortages it blames on neighboring India, which it accuses of imposing an unofficial "trade blockade" over its new constitution.
India denies imposing a blockade, saying its truck drivers are concerned for their safety after protests inside the Himalayan nation.
In a statement, Nepal's Home Ministry said that an "odd-even system" had been introduced Sunday, meaning "vehicles with odd number plates can only operate on odd dates, and even number plates on even dates."
Ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal acknowledged that dozens of protesters had been injured in protests since the constitution was passed but denied there were major security concerns for the trucks to pass the checkpoints.
Dhakal told CNN demonstrations had been taking place in Nepal for months before the constitution was enshrined and trucks had been entering without major problems.
