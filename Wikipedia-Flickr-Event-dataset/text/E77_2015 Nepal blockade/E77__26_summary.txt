The upshot of the crisis was fuel black marketeering.
A litre of petrol is being sold in the black market for somewhere between Rs 300 to Rs 450 inside the Valley.
In past two months, he said, he has bought around 500 litres of petrol from black marketeers, paying a few hundred rupee extra.
Jyoti Baniya, president of Consumers’ Rights Protection Forum, says black marketeers are also dealing cooking gas and food items these days.
“We have held 111 people involved in fuel black marketeering in the last 12 days.”Published: 11-12-2015 09:30
