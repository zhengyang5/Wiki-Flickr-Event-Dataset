Organising a press meet on Saturday, Bhattarai said he had resigned from all party positions, party membership and Parliament.
In June, 2013, Bhattarai resigned as the Maoist vice-chairman and was serving as a senior leader of the party.
However, the formation of the CPN (Unity Centre) in 1991 brought Dahal and Bhattarai together in the same party again.
Bhattarai underlined the need for promulgation of a new constitution at any cost to institutionalise republicanism, secularism and federalism.
Departure unfortunate, says partyKATHMANDU: The UCPN (Maoist) has described Bhattarai’s decision to quit the party as “unfortunate”.
