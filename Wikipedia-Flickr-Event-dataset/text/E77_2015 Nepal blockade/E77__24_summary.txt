Sep 30, 2015-Around 2,000 factories in the Bara-Parsa industrial corridor have shut down as their shipments of raw materials have been cut off by political turmoil in the region.
A shortage of fuel, in particular, has made it impossible for the factories to stay in operation.
The factories are reporting daily losses of Rs500 million to Rs600 million.
“We have already sustained losses totalling Rs23 billion,” Kaderiya said.
Meanwhile, shipments which have entered Nepali territory remain piled up as workers have refused to move them citing security reasons.
