Hundreds of people queue in the Nepali capital Kathmandu to buy firewood as the Himalayan nation faces a crippling shortage of fuel and supplies.
Birendra Kumar Yadav, the general manager of the state-run Timber Corporation, said on Monday that the government had put thousands of kilograms of the material on sale to try to ease the ongoing crippling fuel shortage.
"We will continue to supply until the fuel shortage ends so that at least the public will not have problems cooking their meals," Yadav said.
The fuel shortage has also left many people without enough gas to cook food as the winter sets in.
Nepal has now formally asked China to the supply the Himalayan country with petroleum products in order to tackle the fuel crisis.
