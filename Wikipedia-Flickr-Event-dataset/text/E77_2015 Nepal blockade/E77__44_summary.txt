Sashi Bhusan Prasad Singh, a pharmacy owner, said the district is facing an acute shortage of emergency medicines.
Singh said there is a high demand for emergency medicines and that patients need them at any cost.
He said they will be compelled to shut clinics if the situation continues.
District Health Office said health services have been affected due to the shortage of petroleum products.
Locals have been demanding that the government should address the issues of agitating Madhes-based parties and resolve the ongoing problems soon.
