At least three Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) troopers and as many smugglers were injured in a clash along the India- border on Wednesday, a top officer said.
Singh said a team of five SSB personnel - including an assistant sub-inspector, a head constable and three constables - were on patrolling duty when the incident occurred.
Three of them received injuries," Singh said.
Our three personnel also received injuries in the clash but they are out of danger, he added.
"Nepalese are claiming that SSB personnel fired bullets inside Nepal, but it is totally wrong."
