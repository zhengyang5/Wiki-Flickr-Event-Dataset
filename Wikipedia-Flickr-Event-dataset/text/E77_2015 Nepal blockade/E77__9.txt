#BackOffIndia began trending online last week, days after the long-awaited promulgation of the Nepali Constitution after 507 members of the 598-strong Constituent Assembly (CA) voted in favour of the new Constitution. 66 members of the CA, however, abstained from voting in protest. They belong to Madhes-based political parties who perceive that this constitution reneged on promises that were made to them in 2008.

#NotMyConstitution

Madhes refers to the southern plains across the breadth of Nepal. The majority of its population share strong socio-cultural ties to the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The Madhesis and the Tharus (another sizeable community from the plains) have felt historically marginalised by the unitary state structure, which was based in Kathmandu and controlled by the powerful Hindu high-caste community (the Brahmin-Chettri nexus that gave Nepal its 240-year-old monarchy and the majority of its politicians and bureaucrats).

The new Constitution was expected to draw federal state lines in such a way as to enable marginalised communities to have stronger political representation. But after eight years of political wrangling over the Constitution, the Madhesis feel that they have been short-changed. As former Indian ambassador to Nepal Jayant Prasad notes, 12 out of 20 Madhes districts were incorporated into states with a majority hill population and significant issues previously agreed upon – like the proportional inclusion of marginalised communities in state bodies and delimitation of constituencies on the basis of population – have not been included.
