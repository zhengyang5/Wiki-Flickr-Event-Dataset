New Delhi, Oct. 1: Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj today denied any Indian role in what many in Nepal fear is a blockade of the land-locked country by New Delhi, at a time tensions between the neighbours are spiralling.
"External affairs minister said it is a totally false allegation that India is responsible for the blockade," foreign office spokesperson Vikas Swarup said.
Sharma Oli, chief of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) blamed India for the crisis, reminiscent of then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's blockade against Nepal in 1989 when that country was pulling closer to China.
But in New York, Swarup rolled out figures suggesting that Indian truckers were suffering the most.
"We can only take the trucks to the border - from there on it is the responsibility of the Nepal government."
