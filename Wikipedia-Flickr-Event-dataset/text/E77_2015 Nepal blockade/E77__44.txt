Locals say the government should address the issues of the agitating Madhes-based parties and resolve the ongoing problems

Oct 28, 2015-Health institutions and medical stores in the district have been facing an acute shortage of emergency medicines due to the prolonged banda and Indian blockade.

As a result people, particularly those suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes and several heart diseases, are deprived of medicines.

Sashi Bhusan Prasad Singh, a pharmacy owner, said the district is facing an acute shortage of emergency medicines. “All of the stock has been finished,” Singh said, adding that there are only some vitamins left in his godown.

Singh said there is a high demand for emergency medicines and that patients need them at any cost. “The government should seriously pay attention towards the problem,” said Senior Public Health Officer Mohammad Daud. “Lack of medicines is a major crisis,” he said.

Medicines cannot be ferried from Kathmandu and Birgunj to the district due to the prolonged banda and India’s undeclared trade embargo on Nepal. Some private clinics in the district have already been shut down due to the shortage of medicines.

Some illegally operated clinics have been importing medicines via motorcycles from bordering Indian towns. “Motorcycles are carrying five cartons of medicines at once,” said Dr Devendra Jha, adding that doctors have been running clinics using illegally imported medicines. He said they will be compelled to shut clinics if the situation continues. The cost of medicines has been increased due to the ongoing fuel shortage. District Health Office said health services have been affected due to the shortage of petroleum products. Locals have been demanding that the government should address the issues of agitating Madhes-based parties and resolve the ongoing problems soon.
