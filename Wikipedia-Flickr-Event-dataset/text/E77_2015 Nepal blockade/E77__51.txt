Kathmandu: Prime Minister Madhav Kumar

Nepal met Russian and Chinese ambassadors and lobbied

for his candidate to the prestigious post of president of the

UN General Assembly.

Kul Chandra Gautam is Nepal`s presidential candidate

for the post of 66th session of the UN General Assembly.

Prime Minister Nepal, who met Chinese ambassador Qu Go

Hwang and Russian ambassador Lionidovich Trophimov, asked them

to support the country`s presidential candidate, according to

Prime Minister`s Office (PMO).

Nepal is contesting for the post of UN General

Assembly presidentship on behalf of Asian countries for the

term of 2011-12, the premier said.

During the meeting, the Nepalese prime minister also

consulted with the envoys in the matter of extending the

tenure of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) which

expires in mid-September.

The envoys took positive note of the request for

support as Nepal`s candidacy was relevant at the moment, the

PMO said.

The Russian and Chinese envoys said that it is up to

the Nepal government to decide whether it wants to extend the

UNMIN`s term or not as it is the internal matter of the

country.
