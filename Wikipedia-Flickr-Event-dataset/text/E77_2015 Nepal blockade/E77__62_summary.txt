It is about bruised egos in the New Delhi establishment trying to teach Nepali politicians a lesson for not listening to them.

As a country that shares a long porous border with Nepal, we should have been sensitive to India’s security concerns.
Still, it is hard to figure out how antagonising most of the Nepali population will help India in the long run.
