Yet, the country still has yet to dole out a cent of the $4.1 billion in donations it received, Reuters reported.
According to the news outlet, the government won’t start spending the relief funds until October.
At the time, the government announced that all relief aid for victims had to be donated to the prime minister's Disaster Relief Fund, the Telegraph reported.
"Less money will come to Nepal or it will come through illegal channels,” a Nepal NGO official told the Telegraph.
But amid such concerns, Nepali Prime Minister Sushil Koirala announced in June that he wouldn’t tolerate any corruption with regard to relief aid.
