The lawmakers of the agitating parties had boycotted the voting, saying the amendment was “incomplete”, as it fell short of addressing their concerns, including redrawing of federal boundaries.
The agitating Madhes-based parties said the revision proposal, in line with which the Constitution Amendment Bill was endorsed, was “incomplete” despite being progressive, The Kathmandu Post reported.
“But it will be too early to make any comment, as we are yet to go through the amendment proposal,” Shrestha said, adding that Morcha’s protests would continue unless “there is an agreement on redrawing federal boundaries”.
