Oct 5, 2015-Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Sunday India continued to impose strict restriction on oil supply despite assurances on Saturday that it would provide required quantity of petroleum products.
“The IOC on Sunday said they were unable to provide fuel as they are yet to receive the instruction from the higher authority.”According to the NOC, it had sent 40 tankers to IOC depots in Siliguri to collect petroleum products.
Likewise, IOC depots situated in various bordering Indian towns also denied refilling the petroleum products as sought by Nepal, the NOC officials said.
Subsequently, the IOC had showed its commitment to refill all the petroleum tankers that the NOC would send on the day.
“They turned down our request to clear the oil tankers and gas bullets first,” said the ministry official on condition of anonymity.
