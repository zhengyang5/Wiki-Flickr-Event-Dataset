Invoking the Panchsheel principles, Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli today called on India to "immediately lift the undeclared blockade" imposed on Nepal that would help boost bilateral ties amid the recent political crisis over the country's new Constitution.
"Nepal wants to maintain relations with its neighbours on the basis of the principles of Panchsheel," Mr Oli said.The Panchsheel doctrine is a set of principles to govern relations between states.
Their first formal codification in treaty form was an agreement between China and India in 1954.Mr Oli also asked neighbouring countries "to honour Nepal's territorial integrity, national sovereignty and independence".Addressing the nation for the first time after assuming office last month, Mr Oli said Nepal's new Constitution was excellent in terms of process and content.
Mr Oli said the government has now realised it was Nepal's weakness to depend only on India for supplies of essentials.
Now the government would work to diversify trade and promote renewable alternative energies.Last month, Nepal signed a memorandum of understanding with China to import fuel, ending India's four-decade supply monopoly.
