STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- A new seven-minute cell phone video posted to Facebook shows Eric Garner lying handcuffed and unresponsive on the ground while police officers wait for an ambulance to arrive.
None of the eight cops seen in the video provide him medical help.
An emergency responder, who arrives about four minutes in, takes his pulse and tries to rouse Garner, saying, "Sir, it's EMS.
Afterward, an officer can be heard saying, "He's breathing, he's got a pulse."
A separate cell phone video taken as the scene unfolded shows an officer putting Garner in an apparent chokehold and dragging him to the pavement with the help of other officers.
