Director Spike Lee released a video Monday on Instagram and YouTube, editing together footage of the recent death of Eric Garner with the death of fictional character Radio Raheem in one of his movies, “Do the Right Thing,” presumably to illustrate how little has changed since the movie’s 1989 release.
Garner is the Staten Island father of six who died Thursday after a New York police officer restrained him in a chokehold.
His death was captured on video, which has since gone viral.
Because this year marks the 25th anniversary of the release of Lee’s seminal work, it’s been flecked with celebrations, screenings and discussions that reflect on the message of “Do the Right Thing” and its place in American culture and history.
“Spike, thank you for helping me impress Michelle, and thank you for telling a powerful story,” the president said.
