The cop who choked Eric Garner to death in Staten Island in 2014 had four civilian complaints substantiated against him, but was only docked two vacation days as punishment, documents revealed on Tuesday show.
In all, seven CCRB complaints — including 14 allegations — were made against Pantaleo before the fatal encounter with Garner, the website said.
“Someone should have taken a look at his record a long time ago,” Garner’s mother Gwen Carr said.
Newly obtained documents appear to detail the disciplinary history of Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who choked Eric Garner to death on Staten Island in 2014.
Pantaleo is seen here leaving his Staten Island home on July 2, 2015.
