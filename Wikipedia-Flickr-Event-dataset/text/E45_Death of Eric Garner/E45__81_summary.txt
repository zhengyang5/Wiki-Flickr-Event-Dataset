About 80 percent of cops retrained after Eric Garner’s death called the three-day Police Academy program a “waste of time,” and many fell asleep in their seats, says a high-ranking NYPD official.
“They didn’t get that.”Instead, most of the training involved eight-hour lectures — with some cops dozing off, he said.
On the first day, officers participate in “Blue Courage,” a cultural-sensitivity workshop created by a consulting group and used by other police departments.
“You wouldn’t take a college course at midnight.”“There’s not enough tactical, hands-on training.
This should be 100 percent hands-on training, not sitting in a classroom eating breath mints because it’s going to make you curse less.”Additional reporting by Julia Marsh
