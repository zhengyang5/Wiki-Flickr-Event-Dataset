City officials said it was not safe for demonstrators to cross the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on foot.
"Our goal is not to slow folks down," Sharpton said, referring to the heavy traffic expected for the August 23 protest.
His arrest was captured on video, triggering outrage and raising questions about police use of force.
The protest route will take demonstrators over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which is more than two miles long, to the spot in Staten Island where the incident took place.
They will then march to the offices of the Staten Island district attorney, Daniel Donovan Jr., to demand that an investigation into Garner's death be taken over by federal prosecutors, Sharpton said.
