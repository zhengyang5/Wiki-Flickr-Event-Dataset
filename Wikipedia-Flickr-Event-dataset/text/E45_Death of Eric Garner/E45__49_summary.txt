The forbidden chokehold used by a cop to take down a Staten Island man in a deadly encounter Thursday did not damage his windpipe or neck bones, sources said.
The preliminary autopsy findings could be welcome news for Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo, now named as the cop who wrapped his arm around Eric Garner’s throat while trying to ­arrest him.
The cops saw him sell a “loosie” to a man in a red shirt, law-enforcement sources said.
Garner was known to hawk untaxed cigarettes for 50 cents apiece, and had eight arrests for the offense.
“The guy got punched in the back, and [Garner] jumped up to break it up,” said Ramsey Orta, 22.
