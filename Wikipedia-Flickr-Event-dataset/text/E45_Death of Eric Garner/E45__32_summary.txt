It's more than four minutes into the video before an EMS worker arrives and checks Garner's wrist for a pulse.
"Sir, we're here to help, come on," the EMS worker tells him.
Before Garner is put in the ambulance, the person shooting video asks why Garner never received CPR.
"He's breathing?"
The video raises questions about whether the police and first responders tried hard enough to try and save Garner.
