Defenders of Officer Daniel Pantaleo say he is an upstanding former Boy Scout with few complaints against him.
Critics say he should have been indicted for his role in Garner's death and point to two lawsuits against him as signs that his record as an officer is tarnished.
"He's a model of what we want a police officer to be," said Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
"He's a mature, mature police officer, motivated by serving the community.
Pantaleo has had "very few citizen complaints" against him over the course of more than 300 arrests, according to union spokesman Albert O'Leary.
