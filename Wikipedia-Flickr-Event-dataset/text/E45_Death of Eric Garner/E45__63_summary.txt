The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed I-35W northbound at Exit 14, near Lake Street, in Minneapolis for roughly an hour as more than 100 protesters staged a sit-in on the highway.
â€¢ Photos: Protest shut down I-35WThe march and blockade were tied largely to outrage over the refusal of grand juries in New York and Ferguson, Missouri, to indict police officers who killed black men during confrontations.
Demonstrators worked their way to I-35W where they shut down traffic in the northbound lane for more than an hour.
The group continued to march down I-35W to downtown Minneapolis, eventually ending inside Minneapolis City Hall.
