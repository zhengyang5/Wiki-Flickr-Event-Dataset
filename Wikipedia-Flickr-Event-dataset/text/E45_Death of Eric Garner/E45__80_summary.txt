Seconds later, a video shows an officer behind him grab the 350-pound man in a choke hold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach.
The cause of Garner's death was "compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police," said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office.
A former deputy chief of homicide for the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, Callan said a choke hold does not violate state law but is prohibited by NYPD guidelines on excessive force.
On July 19, Garner's friends and family rallied with Sharpton in Harlem, demanding a full investigation into Garner's death.
The choke hold tactic is prohibited by the NYPD.
