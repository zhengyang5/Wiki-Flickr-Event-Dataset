"He was a great dad -- he's just a warm guy," said Jewel Miller, the mother of Garner's newborn daughter.
Ms. Miller said she and Garner are separated, but he remained a loving father to his 3-month-old baby, Legacy Garner, who was born prematurely.
"He was so proud of his daughter -- she's his miracle," Ms. Miller said.
Late Thursday night, Ms. Miller arrived at the scene in Tompkinsville holding their daughter, Legacy, in her arms.
"I can't believe he's gone -- his daughter has to grow up without a father now," Ms. Miller said.
