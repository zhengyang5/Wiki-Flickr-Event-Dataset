It’s one of five categories medical examiners use to label causes of death and it indicates that “someone’s intentional actions led to the death of another person,” says Gregory G. Davis, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners.
So in a medical examiner’s report “homicide” just means one person intentionally did something that led to the death of someone else.
Criminally negligent homicide, on the other hand, is a class E felony in New York State.
A lot of things are class E felonies in New York State, like arson, computer trespass, auto stripping and residential mortgage fraud.
“There are only so many words that we have,” says the National Association of Medical Examiner’s Davis.
