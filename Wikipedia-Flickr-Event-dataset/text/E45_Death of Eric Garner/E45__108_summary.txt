Kobe Bryant and several of his Los Angeles Lakers teammates became the latest athletes to wear T-shirts emblazoned with the words "I Can't Breathe" in solidarity with those protesting the police killing of Eric Garner.
The Lakers players wore the shirts during pre-game warmups before their game against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night in Los Angeles.
The official Twitter account of the Lakers shared a photograph and video of Bryant and his teammates wearing the T-shirts during warm-ups.
Before the team took the floor at the Staples Center, Lakers forward Carlos Boozer shared a photo of one of the T-shirts draped over his chair in the team's locker room.
"I Can't Breathe" were Garner's last words as captured in a bystander's video.
