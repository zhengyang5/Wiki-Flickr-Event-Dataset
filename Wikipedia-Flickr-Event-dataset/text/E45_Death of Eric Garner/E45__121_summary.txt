Now, documents obtained exclusively by ThinkProgress indicate that Pantaleo, who is still employed by the NYPD, had a history of breaking the rules.
Before he put Garner in the chokehold, the records show, he had seven disciplinary complaints and 14 individual allegations lodged against him.
However, when asked if a CCRB complaint number listed on the documents (CCRB# 201116562) was a real case, representatives confirmed that it was, adding that it had been closed.
Pantaleo’s CCRB disciplinary record stops in 2014, when he was put on desk duty in response to Garner’s death.
The CCRB records don’t indicate which investigators were assigned to the apparent cases against Pantaleo, let alone their experience levels.
