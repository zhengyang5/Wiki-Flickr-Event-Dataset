Just outside a Staten Island storefront on Thursday night, Erica Garner laid down on the sidewalk where her father collapsed after being put in a chokehold by a New York police officer.
Garner led a group of protesters on a march to a memorial for her father, Eric Garner, who died shortly after the incident.
Garner said she will continue to lead protests in Staten Island twice a week in memory of her father, who died at age 43 after NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in the chokehold.
