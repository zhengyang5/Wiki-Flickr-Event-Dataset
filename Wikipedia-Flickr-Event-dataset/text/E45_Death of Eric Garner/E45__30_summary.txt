New footage posted online purports to show more than seven additional minutes of the events surrounding the death of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who was put in a chokehold by a New York police officer and died.
De Blasio had endured criticism earlier for his decision to travel ahead of a potential Long Island Rail Road strike.
In a video obtained by the New York Daily News and published Thursday, Garner can reportedly be seen complaining about routine police harassment as two officers stand on either side of him.
Later in the video, the two officers close in on Garner, who repeatedly says, “Don’t touch me,” as one officer puts him in a chokehold.
One officer can be heard saying, “Come on, guy, breathe in, breathe out, all right?” Garner appears motionless on the ground.
