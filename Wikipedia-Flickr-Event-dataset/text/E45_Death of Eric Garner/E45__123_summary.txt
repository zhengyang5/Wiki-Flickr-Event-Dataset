| Getty NYPD hunting for source of leaked records, in latest twist in Garner caseThe New York Police Department is investigating who leaked a document showing a city watchdog agency recommended disciplining NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo at least four times before he fatally choked Eric Garner on Staten Island in 2014.
We can’t say much about it.”The probe is the latest twist in what critics have said is City Hall’s conflicting stance on police transparency.
For decades, the NYPD made available information about outcomes of police disciplinary proceedings as part of a larger dossier detailing personnel changes within the NYPD.
Minutes after Byrne called the leak illegal, his boss, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill, said such information ultimately needs to be released.
De Blasio still says he has not seen the alleged Pantaleo records, and he will not comment on the report more than 24 hours after it was originally published.
