“It was not a chokehold,” Mr. Lynch said, flanked by numerous leaders of the unions representing officers and sergeants, as well as lawyers representing Officer Pantaleo.
He said the use of the term “chokehold” by the office of the chief medical examiner amounted to politics.
Officer Pantaleo is “a good police officer,” who Mr. Lynch said has made well over 200 arrests in his eight-year career.
During a public comment period at the review board meeting, several people urged the board to look at the policy of “broken windows” policing.
Ten chokehold complaints since 2009 have resulted in recommendations of serious discipline from the review board.
