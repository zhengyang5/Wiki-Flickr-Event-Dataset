President Barack Obama on Wednesday addressed a grand jury's decision not to indict a New York City police officer in the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died after being placed in a chokehold.
"This is an issue we've been dealing with for too long and it's time for us to make more progress than we've made," Obama said at the annual White House Tribal Nations Conference in Washington.
"When anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law, that's a problem," he added.
"It's incumbent on all of us as Americans ...that we recognize that this is an American problem and not just a black problem.
It is an American problem when anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law."
