Police in Berkeley used tear gas late Saturday night to break up an evening-long protest over recent incidents in which unarmed African American men were killed by police.
After warning the crowd of protesters, officers fired tear gas, sending people fleeing in panic and pain.
Coats said protesters vandalized police vehicles and threw various objects at officers, including bricks, pipes, rocks and bottles.
Around 1 a.m., police again fired tear gas at the protesters, sending the remaining group scattering.
At about 7 p.m., the Berkeley BART Station was shut down by the disturbances, with the North Berkeley station closed an hour later.
