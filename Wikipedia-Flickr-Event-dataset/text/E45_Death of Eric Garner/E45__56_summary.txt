We speak to Page May, teacher and co-founder of the Chicago based group Assata’s Daughters, about Black Youth Project 100, protesting on Martin Luther King day, getting organised and most importantly, getting free.
Tell us about how and why Assata’s Daughters came into existence?
In that regards the Chicago chapter of Black Youth Project 100 was very important in leading the way – Assata’s Daughters could not exist if BYP 100 had not done that work.
So from that I thought it would be worth the time to develop an inter-generational organisation exclusively focused on mentoring black women and girls.
So with Assata’s Daughters you can get a really great dinner and then study the Black Panther 10 point programme.
