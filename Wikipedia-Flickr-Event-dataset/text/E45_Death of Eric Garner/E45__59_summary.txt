"A grand jury does not determine conviction and it only determines whether there is enough evidence to go to trial.
If a video of a man being choked and saying 11 times 'I can't breathe' was not enough to go to trial, only a release of the grand jury minutes could explain to us why it was not," the statement read.
"With the judge's decision, the public is left to speculate as to why not, or to assume that the district attorney did not present all of the available evidence to the grand jury."
