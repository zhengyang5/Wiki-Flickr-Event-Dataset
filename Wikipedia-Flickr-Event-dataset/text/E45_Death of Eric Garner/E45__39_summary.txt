An amateur video of Garner’s arrest shows an officer putting him in a choke hold after he refuses to be handcuffed.
Another friend of Garner’s, Sakina Matthews, said repeatedly seeing the video of the police takedown of Garner has taken its toll.
Sims and Matthews said they believe the choke hold killed Garner and said the officers involved should already have been arrested.
Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Tuesday the police department would retrain its officers on the use of force.
