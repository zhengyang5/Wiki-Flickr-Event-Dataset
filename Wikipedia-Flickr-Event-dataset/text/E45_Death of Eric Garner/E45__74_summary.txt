Two New York City police officers were "assassinated," shot "execution-style" as they sat in their patrol vehicle in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, city officials said.
Liu and Ramos may have not even seen the gunman before they were shot, Bratton said.
"Officer Liu and Officer Ramos never had the opportunity to draw their weapons," he said.
One city councilman told ABC station WABC-TV in New York that the shooting in Brooklyn was "the worst thing that could have happened."
This is the NYPD vehicle that forensic techs are focusing on after 2 officers were shot in Brooklyn.
