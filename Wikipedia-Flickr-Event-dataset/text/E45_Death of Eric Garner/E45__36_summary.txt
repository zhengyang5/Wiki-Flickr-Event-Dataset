The video shows a dying man lying on the street for more than 6 minutes as officers calmly wait for an ambulance, showing no sign of urgency.
A separate more-circulated cell-phone video shows Garner upset and frustrated with perceived harassment by police officers who then react to his lack of cooperation with force.
The fatal encounter July 17 on Staten Island started when officers confronted Garner, because they suspected him of selling cigarettes illegally.
"I didn't do s***t, I'm minding my own business," Garner is heard telling a police officer in one video.
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that federal officials were moving ahead with a civil rights investigation into Garner's death.
