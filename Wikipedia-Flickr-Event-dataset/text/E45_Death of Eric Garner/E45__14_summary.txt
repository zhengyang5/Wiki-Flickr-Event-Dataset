BERMAN: As you mentioned, this is just the first of what will be several community meetings that the attorney general will hold.
And what you don't really get is a clear answer from the White House on this.
All of the issues in Ferguson have been involving local police departments, which the attorney general does not control.
BERMAN: Sunny, another thing that the attorney general will discuss tonight is the ongoing federal investigation in Ferguson.
As I said, we are going to check in with Atlanta as soon as we see the attorney general speaking.
