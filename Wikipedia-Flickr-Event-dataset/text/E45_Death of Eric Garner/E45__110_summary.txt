Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderEric Holder says he'll decide on a 2020 run by early next year Walker sets special election date after losing court fight Eric Holder says he’s considering presidential bid MORE said he thought was “a good thing” that NBA players were protesting the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner by wearing “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirts during the warm-ups before games.
“And to have LeBron [James], Derrick Rose and others who wore those ‘I Can’t Breathe’ shirts, that shows a level of involvement.
NBA stars began wearing the shirts after a grand jury opted against indicting police officers who put Garner, an unarmed black man, into a chokehold as they were attempting to arrest him.
The decision — coupled with a grand jury’s decision not to indict a Ferguson, Mo., police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager — have sparked mass protests around the country.
Holder said in the article published Monday he believed there was “just no need” for police departments to continue using chokeholds during arrests.
