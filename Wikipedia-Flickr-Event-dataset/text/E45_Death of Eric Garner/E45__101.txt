George W. Bush weighs in on Eric Garner death

Former president George W. Bush weighed in on the death of Eric Garner at the hands of a police officer, saying it’s sad that race is still so divisive.

Bush told CNN in an interview airing Sunday that when he saw the video of a New York City police officer putting Garner in a headlock, “I thought how sad. The verdict was hard to understand. … It’s sad that race continues to play such an emotional, divisive part of life.”

“She said, ‘You’ve got to understand that there are a lot of black folks around that are incredibly more and more distrusting of law enforcement,’” Bush said. “Which is a shame, because law enforcement’s job is to protect everybody.”

When asked about Hillary Clinton — wife of former President Bill Clinton, Bush’s proclaimed “brother from another mother” and considered by Bush to be a “sister-in-law” — he said that he thinks his actual brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, would “absolutely” beat the former secretary of state in a race for the presidency.

More of Bush’s interview will be shown on Sunday at 9 a.m. on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
