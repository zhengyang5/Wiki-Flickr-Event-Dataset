And I thank the mayor and the police commissioner for facilitating this meeting.
And people feel that you are not just another politician, but that you the transformational mayor that they look to be.
But I also think, Commissioner, that the best way to make police stop using illegal chokeholds is to perp-walk one of them that did.
Mayor: Thank you very much Commissioner Carrion.
And I think thatâ€™s a part of a bigger process of reform that we came here to do.
