Story highlights Defenders of Officer Daniel Pantaleo say he's an upstanding former Boy Scout

"He's a model of what we want a police officer to be," a union rep says

Critics say Pantaleo should have been indicted and point to lawsuits against him

(CNN) Conflicting portraits have emerged of the police officer at the center of the controversy surrounding the death of Eric Garner in Staten Island during an attempted arrest in July.

Defenders of Officer Daniel Pantaleo say he is an upstanding former Boy Scout with few complaints against him. Critics say he should have been indicted for his role in Garner's death and point to two lawsuits against him as signs that his record as an officer is tarnished.

Police union officials describe him in glowing terms, saying he is no hothead.

"He's a model of what we want a police officer to be," said Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. "He's a mature, mature police officer, motivated by serving the community. He literally is an Eagle Scout."

Pantaleo has had "very few citizen complaints" against him over the course of more than 300 arrests, according to union spokesman Albert O'Leary.
