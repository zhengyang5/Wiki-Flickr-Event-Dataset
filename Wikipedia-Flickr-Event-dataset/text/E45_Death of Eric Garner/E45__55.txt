More than 2,500 people have marched in New York's Staten Island to protest over the death of an unarmed black man following an incident with a white police officer.

Footage obtained by local media appears to show Eric Garner, who was stopped for selling loose cigarettes, being held in a chokehold.

The protest follows the outcry over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, which has sparked debates about race relations and law enforcement in the US.
