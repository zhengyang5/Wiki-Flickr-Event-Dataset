Now, on Friday (December 5), two days after a New York grand jury decided not to indict the police officer who put a chokehold on the now-deceased Eric Garner, Crook drops "I Can't Breathe" exclusively with MTV News.
Police offcier Daniel Pantaleo was seen on video taking Garner down with a chokehold, while the 43-year old man shouted out "I Can't Breathe" 11 times.
Wednesday's decision not to indict has triggered a number of protests across the nation and now Crooked's new track.
Over the course of the four-minute song, the Slaughterhouse MC expresses his frustration in a somber tone, a tone that we aren't used to hearing him rap in.
