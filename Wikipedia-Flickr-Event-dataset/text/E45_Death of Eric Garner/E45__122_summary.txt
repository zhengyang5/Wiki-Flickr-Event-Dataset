The Civilian Complaint Review Board found enough evidence to substantiate four claims that Officer Pantaleo had abused his authority, according to the records published by ThinkProgress.
But the official, Jerika Richardson, would not say if the documents were authentic or if the cases had involved Officer Pantaleo.
Officer Pantaleo, who had been on the force for eight years when Mr. Garner, 43, died on July 17, 2014, remains on desk duty.
Two of the substantiated allegations in the leaked documents stem from a 2012 street stop that resulted in disciplinary action against Officer Pantaleo.
Another set of allegations against Officer Pantaleo that were found to be credible involved a vehicle stop and search in 2011.
