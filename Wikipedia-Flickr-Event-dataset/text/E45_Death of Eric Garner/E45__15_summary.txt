Garner died after he was put in a chokehold while being arrested last month for selling untaxed loose cigarettes.
On Friday, the medical examiner ruled Garner's death to be a homicide.
Mr. Garner, whose breathing and weight issues also played a role in his death, according to the medical examiner, was a father of six and grandfather of two.
At a rally Saturday morning in Harlem, Esaw Garner, Mr. Garner's widow, demanded that prosecutors take the case to a grand jury immediately.
Given all that, the homicide ruling will put enormous pressure on prosecutors to level murder or manslaughter charges against those shown in the video.
