Thousands of demonstrators disrupted New York City traffic into early Thursday after a grand jury decided not to bring charges against a white police officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man.
It was the second grand jury in just over a week to decline to prosecute a white policeman in the death of an unarmed black man.
Pantaleo, an eight-year NYPD veteran, testified at the grand jury.
The officer in the Michael Brown shooting also testified to the Missouri grand jury.
In ruling Garner's death a homicide, the city medical examiner said police officers killed him by compressing his neck and chest.
