After spending two months in New York's Rikers Island, Ramsey Orta, the man who filmed Eric Garner's chokehold death, has been released on bail.
Since 23-year-old Orta was taken into custody in February on drug charges, a gofundme.com page was set up in his name to raise bail money.
Orta claims that since filming Garner's July death, he has been targeted by police officers.
"It's payback for him exposing what they did to Eric Garner and the bad things that they were doing," Orta's mother, Emily Mercado, told New York's CBS affiliate.
At a proceeding in February, Orta plead not guilty and told authorities that his arrest was a “frame-up.” A court date has not been set.
