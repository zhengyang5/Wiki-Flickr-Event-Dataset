The police report compiled by a commanding officer in the investigation unit on Staten Island describes how Eric Garner resisted arrest.
Officers Pantaleo and Justin D’Amico also claim they had to get control of Garner, but never mentioned the use of a chokehold.
People are now questioning how the police report can turn out to be so different from what videos show.
“We truly believe and have faith that this investigation is going to continue on.”The NYPD did not comment when contacted by PIX11.
