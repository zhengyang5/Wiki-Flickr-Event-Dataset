﻿"On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Eric Garner, on this day we have received the Medical Examiner's findings concerning the cause of his death.
My administration will continue to work with all involved authorities, including the Richmond County District Attorney, to ensure a fair and justified outcome.
I've said that we would make change, and we will.
As Mayor, I remain absolutely committed to ensuring that the proper reforms are enacted to ensure that this won't happen again.
"I'd also like to thank the Office of Chief Medical Examiner for conducting a thorough and expeditious review of the cause of death in this tragic incident."
