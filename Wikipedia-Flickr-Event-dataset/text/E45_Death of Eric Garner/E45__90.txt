Her mother, Esaw Snipes-Garner, earlier told the New York Daily News that the medical emergency was triggered by an asthma attack. Garner had suffered an earlier heart attack after giving birth to her son in August, Snipes-Garner said. Her heart was later found to be enlarged.

The Rev. Al Sharpton told NBC New York that Garner died of natural causes Saturday morning at Woodhull Hospital while surrounded by her family.

"They stayed with her to the end — she was a warrior to the end," Sharpton, the president of the National Action Network and an MSNBC contributor, told reporters.

Garner gained national prominence after speaking out in the wake of her father's death in 2014 — an incident caught on cellphone video and one of several high-profile police encounters involving unarmed black men.

The NYPD tried to arrest Eric Garner, 43, for allegedly peddling loose cigarettes. When he refused to be handcuffed, video showed him being taken down by an officer who put him in a chokehold. He was recorded repeating the phrase "I can't breathe" 11 times, and later died at the hospital.

A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide. A grand jury declined to indict the officer involved, although the city of New York reached a $5.9 million settlement with the Garner family in 2015 for a wrongful-death lawsuit.

"Sometimes [people think] he had a heart attack ... It's a shame because I know what happened on that video," Garner told NBCBLK in March 2015.
