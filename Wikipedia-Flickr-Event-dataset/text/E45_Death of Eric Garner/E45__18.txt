Narcotics officers on Saturday arrested a Staten Island man whose visceral cellphone images of the forceful and ultimately deadly arrest of Eric Garner helped galvanize protests and set off a citywide debate over police practices.

The police charged the man, Ramsey Orta, with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon — a .25-caliber Norton semiautomatic handgun — that the officers said he tried to pass to a teenager on the sidewalk of a drug-prone street blocks from the spot where officers had the fatal confrontation with Mr. Garner.

The officers also arrested the teenager, Alba Lekaj, 17, charging her with possession of the gun and possession of a small amount of marijuana, the police said.

Plainclothes narcotics officers approached Mr. Orta shortly before 10 p.m. Saturday on a stretch of Central Avenue known for drug dealing, the police said, and saw him putting an object into Ms. Lekaj’s waistband. After a search, they discovered the weapon, the police said.

Mr. Orta, 22, recorded a video when officers approached Mr. Garner near the Staten Island Ferry terminal on July 17 and accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes. The recording captured the moment when one officer, Daniel Pantaleo, swung his arm around Mr. Garner’s neck from behind, pulling him to the ground with the aid of several officers. Mr. Garner, 43, died soon after.
