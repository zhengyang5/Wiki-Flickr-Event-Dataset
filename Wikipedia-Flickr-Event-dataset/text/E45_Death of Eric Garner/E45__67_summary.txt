An estimated 600 people gathered at Westfield in Shepherd's Bush for the so-called "die-in" demonstration.
Two peaceful protests were held in west London on Wednesday evening, one inside the Westfield shopping mall and one outside.
"However, we will not tolerate the small minority that offer violence or commit other criminal acts, such as that witnessed outside Westfield."
West London protesters held signs carrying the same "Black lives matter" message as seen in US demonstrations.
