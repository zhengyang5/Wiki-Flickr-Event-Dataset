Pantaleo and fellow Officer Justin Damico were attempting to place Garner under arrest for allegedly selling a tax-free “loosie” cigarette for 50 cents Thursday before the 350-pound diabetic began to resist.
That’s when Pantaleo was caught on camera putting Garner in a chokehold — a move prohibited by the NYPD — and dragging him to the ground, causing him to lose consciousness.
Meanwhile, a law-enforcement source with knowledge of the case said Pantaleo could be charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.
“But this would be contingent upon the [medical examiner’s] final report,” the source continued.
“That’s going to be the main factor — if the ME says that the cop’s chokehold exacerbated the man’s pre-existing health conditions,” which include obesity and asthma.
