The footage shows Scott, dressed in a green t-shirt and black track pants, bolting from his Mercedes-Benz without any immediate sign of provocation.
The mayor also announced that the department would soon be implementing a new bodycam program to increase police accountability.
The officer then returns to where Scott has fallen and drops an item on the grass near the man, the footage shows.
Separate investigations into the incident are being conducted by South Carolina's Law Enforcement Division and the FBI and Justice Department.
The Justice Department has been responsible for investigating several civil rights suits against a raft of officers involved in the killings of unarmed black men in recent months.
