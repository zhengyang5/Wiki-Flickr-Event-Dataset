SOUTH BEND – Social statements are rare within the framework of Notre Dame athletics.
The idea at Notre Dame originated from sophomore player Taya Reimer.
“Notre Dame is a place that has always fought for social justice,” McGraw said after the game.
“We want to create an environment where they make decisions like this.”———©2014 the South Bend Tribune (South Bend, Ind.)
