2014 Black Lives Matter DemonstrationsIn 2013, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi created the #blacklivesmatter hashtag and organization after, in Garza's words , "Trayvon Martin was post-humously placed on trial for his own murder and the killer, George Zimmerman, was not held accountable for the crime he committed."
A year later, on Thursday, July 17, 2014, Eric Garner died after being put into a chokehold by a New York City police officer in Staten Island, New York.
Two days after his death, 300 people marche in his honor through Staten Island, where he was killed.
Since then, people have continued to demonstrate in an effort to protest the systemic devaluation of Black lives, including those of Michael Brown and Tamir Rice, in the United States.
This is an account of the demonstrations that have taken place in the most recent evolution of the "Black Lives Matter" movement, since that first one on July 19, 2014.
