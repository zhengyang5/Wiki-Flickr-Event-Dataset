WASHINGTON, D.C.-- Several members of Eric Garner's family gathered early Saturday morning in downtown Brooklyn to get on the bus down to Washington, D.C. for the Justice For All March.
They got a late start when their 5 a.m. bus didn't leave New York City until about 6:30 a.m., but the ride down to the nation's capital was light and fun.
Gwen Carr, Garner's mother, didn't take the bus and flew down to Washington, D.C. that morning.
The back of the sweatshirt read "12/13/14 Washington, D.C. Protest Fighting Racial Injustice."
Ms. Carr, Erica Garner and Garner's widow led a chant of "I can't breathe!"
