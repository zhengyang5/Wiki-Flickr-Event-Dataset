According to the New York Post, an autopsy of Garner’s body didn’t show damage to his windpipe or neck bones.
“There’s no indication this is death by strangulation or asphyxia,” a source told the Daily News.
Meanwhile, on Sunday, another video of Garner’s fatal encounter with the police was posted to YouTube.
Other than the one cop who pats the dying man on the shoulder and encourages him to “breathe in, breathe out,” no one makes any effort to resuscitate him.
