Indiana Cop Sells 'Breathe Easy Don't Break The Law' T-ShirtsImage via South bend Uniform Co.'s Facebook page.
Meanwhile, three members of the South Bend Common Council and the head of the South Bend NAACP have asked area stores to not sell the T-shirts, calling them "divisive."
Barthel responded to the criticism on South Bend Uniform Co.'s Facebook page, doubling down on the tone deafness in the process.
For those upset, please understand when we use the slogan "Breathe Easy" we are referring to knowing the police are there for you!
Maybe if Barthel's design read "Breathe Easy, We're Here For You" or something similar, there wouldn't be a backlash.
