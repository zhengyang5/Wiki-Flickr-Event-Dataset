In the statements, the OSCE chairwoman-in-office as special coordinator and leader of the short-term OSCE observer mission, Vilija Aleknaite-Abramikiene, said that the elections were well organized and held professionally.
The International Election Observation Mission with representatives from 30 different countries arrived in Turkey to observe the general elections, which they described as well organized.
The OSCE representatives said that a stable Turkey displays a balancing and stabilizing role in a highly conflicted area.
Turkey has been an electoral democracy since 1950, and the fairness and freedom of Turkish elections have been praised by international observers.
Most recently, in August 2014, the OSCE observed the presidential election in Turkey, in which people directly voted for the president for the first time, and praised the elections for being free and fair.
