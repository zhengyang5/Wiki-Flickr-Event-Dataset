The OSCE assessment of the Turkish elections underscores an organized and willing voter base, adding that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan clearly violated the impartial role of the presidency by going on the campaign trail.
Abramikiene mentioned the picture of a severely wounded and bandaged citizen casting his ballot as one of the most touching moments.
The observers criticized President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for violating the impartiality of the presidency along with restrictions on the press.
The observers also called for the 10 percent threshold to enter the Turkish parliament to be revised.
"The 10 percent threshold limits political pluralism, and we continue to urge that it would be lowered substantially," Head of Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Tiny Kox said.
