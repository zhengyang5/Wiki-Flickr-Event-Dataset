Elections on horizon in Turkey as AKP-CHP talks failANKARATurkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu (R) and main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (L) arrive their meeting as part of the coalition talks in Ankara, Turkey, August 13, 2015.
Nobody should get stressed with things such as an ‘early election will make Turkey lose one year, five years.’ An election is like being vaccinated.
When you are vaccinated, sometimes, you may feel a little sting at a time when you don’t want to.
If you respect the national will, you should have listened to its message in the elections.
“Twenty-four hours is a very long time in politics.”As talks with the CHP failed, Davutoğlu should return the mandate to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, he said.
