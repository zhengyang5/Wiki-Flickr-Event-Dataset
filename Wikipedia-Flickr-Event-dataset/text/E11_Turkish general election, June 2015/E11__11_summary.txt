President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accepted Mr Davutoglu's gesture but asked him to stay in the post until a new government was formed.
Mr Erdogan is now expected to give Mr Davutoglu the difficult task of forming a new coalition government.
After the official final result is declared, the AK Party will have 45 days to form a new government.
The pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) upset his ambitions by crossing the 10% threshold, securing seats in parliament for the first time.
