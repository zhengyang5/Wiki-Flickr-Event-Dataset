In a stinging setback to Mr. Erdogan, his party lost its majority in parliament for the first time since 2002.
As his hold on power has solidified, Mr. Erdogan has grown increasingly authoritarian.
Mr. Erdogan was thwarted by the electoral success of Turkey's new political star, Selahattin Demirtas.
Mr. Demirtas is the telegenic leader of the pro-Kurdish, left-wing People's Democratic Party (HDP).
Much still depends on Mr. Erdogan.
