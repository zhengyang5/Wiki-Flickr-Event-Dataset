Supporters of the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic party (HDP) were celebrating the group's gains in Turkey's parliamentary election, amid a blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AK party), which lost its majority.
"The AK party formed a wide coalition when it came to power ... but it lost the support of conservative Kurds," Tul said.
Al Jazeera's Jamal Elshayyal, reporting from Ankara, said there was "no doubt" the result was a big blow to the AK party but it would continue to wield power.
"The AK party will have to rethink though some of its approaches and maybe its policies too.
They don't want to see him rallying as if he is the leader of the AK party."
