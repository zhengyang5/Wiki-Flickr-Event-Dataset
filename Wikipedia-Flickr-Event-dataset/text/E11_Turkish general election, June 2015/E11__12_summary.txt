Turkish media pokes fun at President Erdogan, whose daily televised addresses seem to have stopped after humiliating defeat.
According to Hurriyet Daily, as of Monday afternoon the notoriously publicity-hungry Erdogan has not appeared on TV for more than 24 hours.
Gleeful anti-AKP Turks have even created an online ticker counting the number of hours Erdogan has been absent from their TV screens.
Erdogan did finally issue a response to the election results Monday afternoon.
The AKP party would have needed a two-thirds majority to have enacted the sweeping changes Erdogan was seeking.
