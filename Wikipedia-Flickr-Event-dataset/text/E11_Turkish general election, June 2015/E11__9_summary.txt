AKP candidate elected as Turkey's parliament speakerANKARACİHAN photoWho is İsmet Yılmaz?
Yılmaz was elected to parliament for the first time in the June 2011 election as a deputy representing his hometown of Sivas.
“One more time, there is a speaker who has been elected by a single party’s votes.
I wish the opposition could accomplish this, but the MHP has presented the seat of the parliament speaker as a gift to the AKP.
If I would have said that this is a signal, then I would have opposed what I have earlier alluded to.
