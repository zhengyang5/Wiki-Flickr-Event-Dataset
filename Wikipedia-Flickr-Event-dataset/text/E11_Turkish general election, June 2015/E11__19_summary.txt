The AKP has 258 seats in the parliament, CHP 132, and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) 80 each.
If efforts to form a coalition within the constitutional limit of 45 days are unsuccessful, Erdogan can call snap elections within 45 days.
Erdogan on Friday again warned he could call early elections if coalition talks failed.
"The formation of a coalition with a majority in parliament is my desire," he told supporters in Istanbul, citing "serious issues" facing Turkey, without elaborating.
But Turkey's three opposition parties said they would refuse to join a coalition government with the AKP unless Erdogan gives up his hopes of a presidential system.
