With his youthful good looks and dynamic oratorical style, Kurdish leader Selahattin Demirtas has earned himself the moniker 'the Kurdish Obama' â€“ he can now add electoral success to the traits he shares with the US president.
In a victory speech in Istanbul, Demirtas bolstered his left wing credentials, with reference to Turkey as a whole rather than his own Kurdish background.
- Selahattin Demirtas"We, as the oppressed people of Turkey who want justice, peace and freedom, have achieved a tremendous victory today.
Erdogan branded his Kurdish rival a "pretty boy" and accused him of being a front for the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
He's a very good speaker and his political capabilities have proven to be a good match against Erdogan, a political mastermind."
