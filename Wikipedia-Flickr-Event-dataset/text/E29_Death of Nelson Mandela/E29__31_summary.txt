Mr Sharma said: “Nelson Mandela was an inspirational Commonwealth leader of the twentieth century.
“Nelson Mandela knew neither fear nor hate.
“It was our privilege to work alongside Nelson Mandela in striving for safer and fairer lives for Commonwealth citizens in Africa, and a dignified future for our people around the globe.
South Africa, Africa, the Commonwealth, and the world are today enriched by it.
We stand together with the people of South Africa at this time of national mourning.”
