Following is the full text of the statement by President Park Geun-hye on the passing of former South African President Nelson Mandela.



I offer my deepest sympathy to the bereaved family and the people of the Republic of South Africa on the passing of President Nelson Mandela.



He was a great statesman who put a peaceful end to apartheid, which had long divided South Africa. His great cause will pave the way toward world peace and be long remembered in the hearts of not only South Africans but also people all around the world.



Honoring his noble spirit, I join all Koreans in praying for the eternal peace of his soul.
