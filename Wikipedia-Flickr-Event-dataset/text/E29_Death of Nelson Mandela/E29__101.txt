It was the former South African president's ability to forgive his former apartheid-era oppressors that kept his nation together, Mr O'Neill said on Friday.

"It was his absolute forgiveness of the apartheid government that imprisoned him ... that laid the foundations for the transition from decades of undemocratic apartheid rule to a robust democracy in a very short period of time," Mr O'Neill said.

"It will continue as strong as ever even after his passing, when we remember the struggles he endured, and his fellow freedom fighters endured, just to gain the freedom and democracy we all too often take for granted.

"The Government and People of Papua New Guinea join with me in mourning the passing of the most influential and inspirational statesman of our time."

Papua New Guinea opposition leader Belden Norman Namah paid tribute to Mandela as "the greatest fighter for freedom".

"When the world was threatened by the great racial divide, Mandela became the great unifying bridge that made the world one," Mr Namah said in a statement.

He said Mandela was afraid of nothing, "except things staying the same".
