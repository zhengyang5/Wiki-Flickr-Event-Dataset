Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued the following statement upon the death of Nelson Mandela, former President of the Republic of South Africa:“With the death of Nelson Mandela, the world has lost one of its great moral leaders and statesmen.
Mr. Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years by the former Government of South Africa, for his part in the struggle that would ultimately end the system of apartheid.
“Despite his long years of captivity, Mr. Mandela left prison with a heart closed to calls for a settling of scores.
“On behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, Laureen and I extend our condolences to Mr. Mandela’s widow, Graça Machel, his entire family and all citizens of South Africa.
Canada, a nation that granted Mr. Mandela honorary citizenship in 2001, mourns with you and the entire world today.”
