Buckingham Palace said Prince Charles will represent the British monarchy at the memorial events in South Africa commemorating the Nobel Peace Prize-winner's life.
The Queen discussed plans for the ceremony to Mr Mandela as early as June, according to The People.
The pair had a strong relationship and Queen Elizabeth first met Mr Mandela in 1991 and received him again in 1996.
Mourners will walk up the steps into the Union Buildings' amphitheatre and file past Mr Mandela's body.
Sunday has been declared a national day of prayer and reflection over Mr Mandela's death.
