Mandela never kneeled in His fight against Apartheid, not even when he was deprived of freedom for 27 years.
The long years of suffering neither weakened Mandela, nor killed His spirit.
His vision and kindness save the South African people from suffering and hardships.
Nelson Mandela with His unstoppable run towards freedom left to humanity the heritage of the immense and eternal value, the model of transformation of an époque and of a life of goodness and wisdom.
