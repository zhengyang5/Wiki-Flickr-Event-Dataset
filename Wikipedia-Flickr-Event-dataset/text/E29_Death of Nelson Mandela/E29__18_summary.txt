Nelson Mandela has "set the standard for service" to the world, Archbishop Thabo Makgoba of Cape Town told the congregation of Holy Cross, Nyanga in a homily on the national Day of Prayer and Reflection.
"Through his example, he has set the standard for service to country and mankind worldwide, whether we are individual citizens, cabinet ministers or presidents, and continues to call on us all to better serve our fellow human beings and contribute to the betterment of our communities," Archbishop Makgoba said.
Each of these individuals was committed to the global struggle for human dignity, equality and democracy, and Madiba still remains a beacon of hope and an inspiration for those around the world who are still fighting for their freedom and for justice.
"As we look back and learn from Nelson Mandela's own long walk to freedom and reflect on his life-long dedication to instilling the values of Ubuntu, integrity and learning, his legacy is an inspiring one.
It will continue to inspire generations of people to come who themselves want to change the world and make it a better place in which all citizens can live and thrive."
