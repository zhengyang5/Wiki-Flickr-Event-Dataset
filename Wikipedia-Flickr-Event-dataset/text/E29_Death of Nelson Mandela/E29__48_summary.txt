President Robert Mugabe finally broke his 24 hour silence and issued a statement on the death of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela.
The bizarre silence as other world leaders and celebrities spoke out had triggered criticism in the media and social networks given Mugabe’s criticism of Mandela in the past.
The late Nelson Mandela will forever remain in our minds as an unflinching fighter for justice.”Mugabe though appears to have had a frosty relationship with Mandela.
Only this year Mugabe slammed Mandela’s reconciliation policies, and labelled him “too much of a saint” in a television interview.
There is also video footage in which Mandela in a meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that an increasingly unpopular President Robert Mugabe did not want him (Mandela) released from prison.
