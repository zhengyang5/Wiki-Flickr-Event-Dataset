The International Olympic Committee has announced it will lower the Olympic flag for three days to mark the death of Nelson Mandela.
IOC president Thomas Bach paid tribute to the former South African president, who died on Thursday aged 95.
Bach, who had met Mandela personally, said: "The Olympic Movement is mourning the loss of a great friend and a hero of humanity.
"However, his attitude towards sport can make us proud - proud at his understanding of the potential of sport to bring inclusion."
South Africa's IOC member Sam Ramsamy, who was a leading member of the anti-apartheid movement, added his tribute, praising Mandela for his "understanding of sport as a uniting factor".
