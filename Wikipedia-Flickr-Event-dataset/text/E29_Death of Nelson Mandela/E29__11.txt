Mandela told opposition leader: Your opinion counts

Politicians continue to arrive at the home of former President Nelson Mandela in Houghton to mourn his death.

Among those who have arrived in the past few hours are former African Democratic Christian Party leader Reverend Kenneth Meshoe, Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane, the DA’s national spokesperson, Mmusi Maimane, United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa and former ANC treasurer Mathews Phosa as well as NEC members including Gwede Mantashe, Blade Nzimande, Angie Motshekga, Bheki Cele and Tony Yengeni, who arrived in a maserati.

Meshoe said: “There are so many things that we could say about Madiba, but his ideals and foundation are what will stick with me for many years to come.

“After 27 years in prison he could have wanted revenge. But because he was a visionary and wise man he said to his friends ‘No, let us preach reconciliation.’�?

Meshoe said people across the world were worried about what would happen to South Africa now that Mandela was gone.

“Let us respond to them by building on the legacy of Madiba.�?

Meshoe said his fondest memory of Mandela was being called to the president’s office in Parliament one day.

“He said to me ‘You know what Meshoe, people can shout at you when you speak but as a leader of one of the parties here your voice is very important. Your opinion counts.’�?

It’s not just politicians who are visiting the suburban home: hundreds of people of all ages and races are still arriving with bouquets of flowers, many of them carrying the South African flag.

Entrepreneurs have seized the opportunity, selling ANC apparel, bottled water and hot dogs outside and near the house.
