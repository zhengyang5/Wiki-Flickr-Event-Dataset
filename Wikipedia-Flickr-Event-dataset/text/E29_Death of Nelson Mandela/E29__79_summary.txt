Statement by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt on the death of Nelson Mandela"Nelson Mandela was a person who changed the world.
He was deeply convinced of the equality between human beings and had an equally strong commitment and capacity for reconciliation.
He chose reconciliation where others would have chosen revenge.
He created a new South Africa and gave people all over the world someone to look up to and a role model."
