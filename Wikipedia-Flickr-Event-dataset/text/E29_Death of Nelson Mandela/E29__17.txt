MaMbeki: ‘He’s not dead. He’s asleep’

Political stalwart and mother to former President Thabo Mbeki, Epainette Mbeki, has joined millions the world over in expressing shock about Nelson Mandela’s death.

MaMbeki, as she is affectionately known, said she woke up to the bad news this morning but was quick to accept that Mandela had finally found his rest.

“He’s not dead. He’s asleep,” MaMbeki (97) said this morning from her home in the Eastern Cape.

“I can only say right now, rest in peace Mandela. We should celebrate his life.

“The passing of anybody is painful,” she said.

MaMbeki’s late husband, Govan Mbeki, was a Rivonia trialist along with Mandela, and the two were together sentenced to imprisonment on Robben Island.
