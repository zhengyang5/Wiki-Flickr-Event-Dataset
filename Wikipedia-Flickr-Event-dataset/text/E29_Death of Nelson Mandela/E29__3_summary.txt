Many people had waited for two days to pay their respects to Mr. Mandela, queuing in the hot sun for up to eight hours a day, yet were unable to get a spot on the shuttle buses.
At the viewing area in the Union Buildings, the organizational problems were obvious.
Furious at the gate closings, one group of mourners marched off to the Union Buildings, dancing and singing protest songs.
She said she had only wanted to thank Mr. Mandela for the reforms that allowed her to attend a prestigious university where blacks had been barred in the past.
"This was our only chance to see Nelson Mandela, and they won't even let us close to the Union Buildings," said Helani Chauke, an 18-year-old student.
