December 6th, 2013

The President of the Republic, Bujar Nishani issued the following statement about the passing away of Nelson Mandela, the former President of the Republic of South Africa:

“I was immensely saddened when I learnt about Nelson Mandela passed away. Humanity, with this loss, is biding farewell to one of the most distinguished moral leaders and to the icon of resistance and fight for justice and human dignity. Mandela never kneeled in His fight against Apartheid, not even when he was deprived of freedom for 27 years.

The long years of suffering neither weakened Mandela, nor killed His spirit. On the contrary, they filled Him with the desire for reconciliation and understanding among people. He and His dream triumphed. His vision and kindness save the South African people from suffering and hardships.

Nelson Mandela with His unstoppable run towards freedom left to humanity the heritage of the immense and eternal value, the model of transformation of an époque and of a life of goodness and wisdom.

In my name and on behalf of the Albanian people I would like to extend our deep condolences to his spouse, Graça Machel, to his entire family and to the people of South Africa. We, Albanians join the South African people and whole world in this grief.”
