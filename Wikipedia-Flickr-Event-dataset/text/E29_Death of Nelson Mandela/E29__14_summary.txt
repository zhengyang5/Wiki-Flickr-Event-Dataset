The group of more than 100 people congregated near the lawns of the Union Buildings before making a U-turn.
Several of the people waiting to see Mandela's body ran towards the group of Economic Freedom Fighters.
Moments later, at 3.30pm, police announced that no more people would be allowed in to view Mandela's body.
“Thank you (Mandela) for ushering in political freedom... Those who came after you failed to deliver economic freedom,” he said.
