Nelson Mandela was a singular figure on the global stage -- a man of quiet dignity and towering achievement, a giant for justice and a down-to-earth human inspiration.
Nelson Mandela devoted his life to the service of his people and humanity, and he did so at great personal sacrifice.
In the decades-long fight against apartheid, the United Nations stood side-by-side with Nelson Mandela and all those in South Africa who faced unrelenting racism and discrimination.
I was privileged to meet Nelson Mandela in 2009.
Nelson Mandela showed what is possible for our world and within each one of us -- if we believe, dream and work together.
