Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong paid tribute to the late Nelson Mandela on Friday morning, hailing the anti-apartheid icon as an inspiration to millions.
"Rest in peace #Mandela.
You inspired millions with your humanity, courage, and lifelong fight for freedom," wrote Mr Lee on Facebook and Twitter.
Mr Mandela, a former South African president, died peacefully at his Johannesburg home on early Friday morning, Singapore time, after a prolonged lung infection.
He was jailed for 27 years for his opposition to white minority rule in South Africa, a struggle which made him one of 20th century's most famous and beloved global icons.
