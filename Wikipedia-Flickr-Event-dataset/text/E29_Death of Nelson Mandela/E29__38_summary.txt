Freedom on the African continent was a reality for which we were willing to fight.
Then on Feb. 11, 1990, the miraculous happened; Mandela was released.
Here was the man who had created a new moral compass for South Africa and, as a matter of course, the entire continent.
That night, as I watched Mandela walk past me, I understood that his story, the long walk to freedom, was also Africa’s story.
It wasn’t just Nelson Mandela who was transformed during those years of his imprisonment.
