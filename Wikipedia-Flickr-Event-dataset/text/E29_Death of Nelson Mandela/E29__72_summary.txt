As news spread that Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically-elected president and a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, passed away last night at the age of 95, world leaders were quick to pay tribute to the fallen to the revolutionary.
Joining the chorus was Denmark's prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt (S).
"Throughout his life, Nelson Mandela was a beacon of hope in the fight against oppression and injustice in the world," Thorning-Schmidt said in a statement.
"Even in the harshest of circumstances and facing an inhumane apartheid regime, Mandela continued his belief in the humanity of all people and sought peace and reconciliation," the prime minister continued.
His legacy will endure for generations to come.‚ÄùThorning-Schmidt also conveyed her personal sympathies to Mandela's family and the South African people.
