Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin joined other world figures Friday in hailing the late Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black president, who died Thursday night.
Mandela, a 95-year-old Nobel Prize winner and former political prisoner, emerged from jail in South Africa after 27 years to help his country end apartheid rule in 1990.
He was devoted to the idea of freedom and ended the last apartheid on the Earth,” Gorbachev, who became a Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1990, told Dozhd television.
Gorbachev said he was a friend of Mandela, who backed perestroika, the series of reforms that Gorbachev carried out in the late 1980s before the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In November, the South African government announced that Mandela was in a critical state.
