Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong paid tribute to late South African President Nelson Mandela, saying he was "saddened by the passing of a wise leader and a great human being".
In a Facebook post on Friday from New Delhi, where he is calling on Indian leaders, Mr Goh said he had met Mr Mandela several times, and recalled his good nature.
Mr Goh added that he was following the news on Mr Mandela's death from his hotel room in New Delhi.
Mr Mandela had just been released from prison then, after spending 27 years in jail, for his opposition to white minority rule in South Africa .
Mr Mandela visited Singapore in March 1997, in the first state visit by a South African head of state.
