The late anti-apartheid icon, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela left an estate valued at more than 46 million Rand (USD $4.14 million), a public reading of his will revealed earlier today.
The final wishes of South Africa’s former president were revealed midday at the Nelson Mandela Center of Memory in Johannesburg, South Africa.
President Mandela and Ms. Graca Machel were married in community of property and therefore she is entitled to half of his estate.
According to Moseneke, although Ms. Graca Machel has 90 days to contest the will, she agreed to waive all claim to Mandela’s estate.
Moseneke noted that the 46 million Rand (USD $4.13m) valuation of Mandela's estate was subject to final verification and excluded royalties.
