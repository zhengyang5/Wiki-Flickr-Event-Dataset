The Government notes with sadness the death of Nelson Mandela, who had been President of the Republic of South Africa.
Mr Mandela's death is being marked around the world as a result of his positive influence on politics and in particular the manner of his treatment of adversaries.
The Chief Minister, Fabian Picardo, said: "Fulsome tributes have been paid to Mr Mandela by the most powerful political figures in the world and by citizens of all countries, in particular in his native South Africa.
In that respect, Mr Mandela became a figure of towering influence in the world, far beyond the Republic of South Africa.
Our condolences go to his family on behalf of all of Gibraltar."
