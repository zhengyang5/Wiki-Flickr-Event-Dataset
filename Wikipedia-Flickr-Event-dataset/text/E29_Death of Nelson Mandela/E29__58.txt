Indian Political Leaders have mourned the death of South African Anti Apartheid Hero and its first President Bharat Ratna Nelson Mandela .

President Pranab Mukherjee said in his condolence message, that Mandela was an “icon of inspiration for humanity”.

In his message, he conveyed his profound grief and condolences over the loss of a statesman, world leader and icon of inspiration for humanity.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tweeted, “A giant among men has passed away. This is as much India’s loss as South Africa’s. He was a true Gandhian”.

“His life and work will remain a source of eternal inspiration for generations to come. I join all those who are praying for his soul,” he said.

The Vice President of India M. Hamid Ansari said that Mr. Mandela was a living symbol of his people’s quest for freedom and dignity against tyranny and injustice. While his courage, determination and sacrifice inspired millions of people during the anti-apartheid movement, his message of peace, forgiveness and reconciliation thereafter, united them and led the rainbow nation on the path to peace and progress.

Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said, “Mandela had enormous tenacity of purpose, courage of conviction and profound humility. He remained unwavering and resolute in his arduous struggle in spite of decades of incarceration including long years of solitary confinement. As the founding President of non racial democratic South Africa, he provided a healing touch to a people bruised by decades of racial tyranny and violence by following the path of truth and reconciliation.

He truly was a hero and a source of inspiration for generations of young people, activists and freedom fighters. His passing away has made the world much poorer and this day marks an end of an era.

History will respectfully recall Mandela’s struggle and sacrifices. The principles which he espoused shall continue to inspire generations to follow.”
