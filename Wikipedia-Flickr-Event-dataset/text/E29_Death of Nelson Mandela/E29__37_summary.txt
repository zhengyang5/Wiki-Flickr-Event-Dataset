Yesterday, on 5 December 2013, Africa, along with the rest of the world, learned of the death of Nelson Mandela.
I would like to convey the condolences of the Gabonese people to our brothers and sisters in South Africa, the Mandela family and President Jacob Zuma.
Nelson Mandela was a great man who, through his actions, his fight for freedom and his very existence, touched the lives of every single person, well beyond the boundaries of the African continent.
It now falls to us to continue his work and celebrate his life.
I therefore invite all Gabonese people to take a moment of contemplation and join hands in a show of compassion fitting of such a circumstance.
