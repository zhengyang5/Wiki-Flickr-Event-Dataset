However, mourners who had planned to remind themselves of his awe-inspiring legacy by catching the Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom on Friday were disappointed.
Cinemas showing the movie went dark and, starting with the 9.45am screening, did not go ahead as scheduled.
But at the insistence of Mandela's daughters – that Madiba would have wanted the screening to continue – they waited until the end.
Singh says he spent the day at South Africa House in London along with Mandela's daughters Zenani and Zindzi Mandela.
This past weekend, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom emerged as the highest grossing film in South Africa, earning over R4-million, according to Videovision Entertainment.
