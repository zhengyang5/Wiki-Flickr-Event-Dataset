MaMbeki: ‘He’s not dead.
He’s asleep’Political stalwart and mother to former President Thabo Mbeki, Epainette Mbeki, has joined millions the world over in expressing shock about Nelson Mandela’s death.
“He’s not dead.
He’s asleep,” MaMbeki (97) said this morning from her home in the Eastern Cape.
MaMbeki’s late husband, Govan Mbeki, was a Rivonia trialist along with Mandela, and the two were together sentenced to imprisonment on Robben Island.
