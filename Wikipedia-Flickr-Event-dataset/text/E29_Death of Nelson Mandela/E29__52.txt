HIS Majesty Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam (pic L) sent a message of condolence to President of South Africa Jacob Zuma (pic R) following the death of former president Nelson Mandela.

In the message to Zuma, His Majesty said that Mandela would be much missed not only by South Africans but also by a world that saw him as a beacon of hope and courage and as a moral force in international affairs.

His Majesty fondly remembered the visit of Mandela to Brunei Darussalam and stated that the people of Brunei joined His Majesty in expressing their deepest condolences to Zuma and to the government and people of South Africa, especially family members of the late Mandela.
