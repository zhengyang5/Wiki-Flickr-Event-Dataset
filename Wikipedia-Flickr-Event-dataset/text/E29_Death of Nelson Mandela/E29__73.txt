Hungary's government and people are deeply shaken by the death of Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first black president. We express our sincere condolences to his family and the South African people, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said in a statement.

The Prime Minister emphasized that Nelson Mandela's fight for democracy was an inspiration during the years of the communist dictatorship and in the period of transition to the democratic political system. He said Mandela's name stands as a beacon of freedom to everyone around the world.
