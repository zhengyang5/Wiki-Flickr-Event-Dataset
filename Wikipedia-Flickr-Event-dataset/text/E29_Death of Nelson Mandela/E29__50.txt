The mourning will be observed from Saturday to Monday, said a PID handout, terming the legend ‘a true friend of Bangladesh’.



Seen as a ‘moral giant’, former South African President Mandela died in his Johannesburg home on Thursday aged 95, plunging his nation and the world into mourning.



The man, whose unprecedented courage and dedication broke down the cruel barriers of apartheid in South Africa, visited Bangladesh in March, 1997.



He shared the Nobel Peace Prize with FW de Klerk, South Africa’s last white president, in 1993.



A towering figure in 20th century history, Mandela emerged from almost three decades in the prisons of apartheid-era South Africa to become the first black President of a country still struggling to overcome its divisions.



Born in a small village in the eastern Cape, Mandela first became involved in activism against the white minority regime as a young law student.



Joining the African National Congress (ANC) in 1942, he co-founded its Youth League two years later
