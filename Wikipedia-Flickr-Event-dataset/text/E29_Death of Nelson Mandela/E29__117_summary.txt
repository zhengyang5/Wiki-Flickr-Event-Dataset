Mandela will: Graça Machel may waive rights to half of estateWatch the full reading of Nelson Mandela’s will here.
WATCHJohannesburg - Lawyers say former president Nelson Mandela's wife, Graça Machel, is likely to waive her right to half of his estate, opting instead to receive four properties in Mozambique and other assets.
According to a summary of the document, Mandela left his roughly R46m estate to Machel, family members, staff, schools and the ANC.
The home in Houghton, Johannesburg where Mandela died on 5 December, will be used by the family of his deceased son Makgatho.
Even before his death, Mandela's children and grandchildren frequently clashed over who leads the family and who should benefit from his investments.
