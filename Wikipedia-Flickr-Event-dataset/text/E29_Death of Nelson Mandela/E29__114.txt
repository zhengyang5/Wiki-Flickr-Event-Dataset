Terrence Howard and the producers of the 2011 film Winnie Mandela, in which Howard played Nelson Mandela, released a statement about the former South African president’s death Thursday.

“Mandela shall be missed but his spirit remains with us as long as we remember the principal of greater love for one another and respect for oneself,” Howard said. “Rest well brother until the world cries again for the warmth of your brilliant light!”

The Winnie producers added: “Together with our nation and the world, we mourn the loss of South Africa’s greatest hero — former President Nelson Mandela. We extend our heartfelt condolences to all who were touched by his life — especially the Mandela family and close friends. One of the blessings of working on the film, was learning more about this extraordinary man and recognising the impact he made — not only on the lives of South Africans, but on the lives, policies and decisions of leaders around the world. Thank you, Madiba, for bringing your light to our world. May that light shine on forever! Hamba kahle, Tata.”
