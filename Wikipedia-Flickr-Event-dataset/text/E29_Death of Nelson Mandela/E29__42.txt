'Nelson Mandela was Africa’s Mahatma Gandhi' - Mauritian Prime Minister

Port-Louis, Mauritius (PANA) – Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam says his country is mourning a friend, in the person of former South African president Nelson Mandela, who died on Thursday night in Johannesburg.



Speaking on national television from Paris, France, where he is taking part in the Africa Summit on Security and Peace, Ramgoolam said he learned about Mandela’s death “with great emotion and sadness”.



“This was a man whose name will remain for ever in the conscience of humanity. He was a symbol of reconciliation and of humility,” the Prime Minister said.



He added that “Nelson Mandela was Africa’s Mahatma Gandhi.”



Ramgoolam said future generations would one day ask whether such a man really lived on this earth.



He said without Mandela many people would have been killed in South Africa.



“It’s incredible what this man has accomplished,” he added, adding that he had sent a message of sympathy on behalf of Mauritius to the South African people.



The Prime Minister said he would be present at the funeral of Mandela.
