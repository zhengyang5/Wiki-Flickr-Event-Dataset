NAIROBI, KENYA: President Uhuru Kenyatta has declared three days of mourning following the death of former South African President Nelson Mandela.

The President also ordered flags to be flown at half-mast for three days in honour of the legendary African leader starting tomorrow, Saturday 7th December 2013.

Eelier Kenyatta had sent a message of condolence following Mandela’s death in which he termed the departed anti-apartheid icon a ‘shujaa’ (hero).

“Mandela lived and worked for a world in which people should live together in peace and tranquility regardless of colour, race or religion. His strong belief in Africa and its people epitomized the best of the Pan-Africanism spirit.”

Uhuru also praised Mandela’s role in the society after he was released from prison.

“As a free man, President Mandela led the fight to free Africa not only from political bondage but equally important from the scourge of disease, poverty, poor governance and illiteracy -- ills of modern life.

Only the truly exceptional people leave their mark in the world and Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was one of those. Madiba was a child and traditional chief of the Transkei and a leader in this world,” said Kenyatta.
