Around the world, there has been an outpouring of emotions following the death of Nelson Mandela. Leaders all over have been paying tribute to the larger-than-life icon whose struggle against injustices and to end racial oppression inspired the world. The office of the prime minister announced today that it is sending an official note of condolences to the President, People and Government of South Africa. The Belize flag is now flying at half-mast until noon on Saturday and again on September fifteenth when Mandela will be laid to rest. Prime Minister Dean Barrow has described Mandela as (Quote) “the last global hero history will ever see.” (Unquote) In paying tribute to Mandela, P.M. Barrow said that it is impossible for anything like the trajectory of Mandela’s life to occur again. Said Barrow, (Quote) “His towering strength, his unimaginable self-sacrifice, and the way in which he governed post-Apartheid South Africa without recrimination or reprisal, constitute a greatness that will never again be matched.” (Unquote) Mandela, the Prime Minister concludes, is not just an inspiration to Black people everywhere, but to all people everywhere. The Leader of the Opposition, Francis Fonseca, and the People’s United Party have also issued a statement expressing profound sadness at the passing of the global statesman. Says the statement, (Quote) “Nelson Mandela is unquestionably one of the greatest leaders the world has ever known and his life and legacy will forever serve as a shining example of strength, humility, compassion, and service. We stand in solidarity with the people of South Africa as together we mourn the passing of this great man and celebrate his life.” (Unquote) The P.U.P. also called on the government to designate Sunday, December eighth, 2013 as a National Day of Mourning in honour and memory of the late President, Nelson Mandela.
