This is to make way for tributes to Nelson Mandela, City Press reported.
“This was the plan all along,” spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago told City Press.
At the same time they announced that, like SABC, Primedia will be suspending all advertising on its radio stations – Talk Radio 702, 94.7 Highveld Stereo, 567 Cape Talk and 94.5 Kfm – “as a mark of respect” for Madiba.
Kagiso Media, owners of East Coast Radio, Heart FM, OFM, Jacaranda FM, iGagasi FM and Kaya FM, have taken similar steps.
Kagiso’s Lundi Cavernelis told City Press that “across its portfolio Kagiso has cancelled on-air competitions and other on-air content, but generic advertising remains as scheduled”.
