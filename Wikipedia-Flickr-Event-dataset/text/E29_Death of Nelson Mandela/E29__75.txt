Flags are at half mast in Monaco today as the Principality mourns the death of Nelson Mandela.

The palace released a statement saying that all government institutions will be paying respect to the iconic leader, while Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene will attend a special mass in his memory.

The couple are also expected to fly to South Africa. â€œThe royal couple will attend the funeral of the freedom fighter they had the honour of meeting several times. Someone they both considered an example, a symbol of reconciliation, a great man who has, through his courage, selflessness and generosity, changed the course of history," read the statement.

The South African-born princess represented her country as an Olympic swimmer and had a close connection with Mandela. Meanwhile, Princess Stephanie has worked closely with Mandela through her anti-AIDS initiatives.

Nelson Mandela died at the age of 95.
