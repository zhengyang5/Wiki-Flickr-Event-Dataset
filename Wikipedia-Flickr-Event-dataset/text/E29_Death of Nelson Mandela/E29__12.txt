As in life, Madiba brings us together as South Africans and people from across the world and from all walks of life as we mourn and honour the memory and legacy of the father of our young nation.



“Madiba symbolised the exemplary values that all good people the world over hold dear – integrity, commitment to equality and the well-being of all people irrespective of race, faith, geographic location or position,” said Mamphela Ramphele, leader of Agang SA.

She said it was because of these noble, altruistic values that Madiba’s name will be forever remembered with fondness and will inspire all those who are dedicated to working for the good of humanity. Ramphele said: "It is testimony to Nelson Mandela's greatness and his success as an agent of freedom, nation building, transformation and reconciliation that he is mourned all South Africans.

“My personal sadness at losing a father figure and a friend is amplified by the outpouring of grief from people around the world,” said Dr Ramphele.
