PERRY G. CHRISTIEWith the passing today of Nelson Mandela, the world has lost one of its greatest heroes and an inspirational model for the ages.
Mr. Mandela was, to be sure, the Supreme Liberator of South Africa in its struggle to end Apartheid.
That is why the news of Mr. Mandela’s death resonates so profoundly all around the world.
But even as we grieve, we give thanks for the example and personal witness that Nelson Mandela’s life holds for all of us and for generations yet unborn.
On behalf of the Government and people of The Bahamas and on my own behalf I extend heartfelt condolences to the President and people of South Africa and to the widow, children and wider family of the late Nelson Mandela.
