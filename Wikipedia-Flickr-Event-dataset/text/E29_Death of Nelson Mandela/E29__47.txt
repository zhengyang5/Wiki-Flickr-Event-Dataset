PRESIDENT Michael Sata says Nelson Mandela was an icon and a hero of anti-apartheid struggle, who will be remembered by many for his courage, perseverance and endurance and also for championing peace, justice and reconciliation in South Africa.

In a message of condolences to South African President Jacob Zuma, President Sata said Mandela selflessly devoted his time advocating freedom and racial equality.

"It is indeed with a deep sense of great sadness that I learnt of the passing away of your beloved former president, His Excellency Mr Nelson Rolihlahla 'Madiba' Mandela. On behalf of the government, the people of the Republic of Zambia and indeed on my own behalf, allow me to extend my deepest condolences to you, the bereaved Mandela family and indeed the people of South Africa," he stated.

President Sata said Mandela, as president of South Africa, served his country with distinction and was dedicated to uplifting the welfare of his fellow countrymen and women.

"As you and the people of South Africa mourn his passing on, we join you in spirit, reflection and prayer. We also pray that the Almighty God will grant the bereaved family His abundant mercies, solace and fortitude to bear this great loss of a true son of the African soil," stated President Sata.
