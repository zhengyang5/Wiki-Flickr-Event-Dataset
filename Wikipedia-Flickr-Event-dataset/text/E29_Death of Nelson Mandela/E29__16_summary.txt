Fellow Nobel Peace prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu led South African tributes to Nelson Mandela, who died at his Johannesburg home late yesterday.
Frederik Willem de Klerk, the last president of South Africa elected in a whites-only election, praised Mandela’s “remarkable lack of bitterness” in an interview on CNN.
Mandela’s relationship with De Klerk helped keep talks on course over the four years before South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994 as violence raged on the streets of the country’s townships.
Mandela, 95, died at 8:50 p.m. yesterday at his home in Houghton, a suburb in northern Johannesburg, South African President Jacob Zuma said in a televised speech to the nation.
“You will be missed, but your impact on this world will live forever,” South African academy award winning actress Charlize Theron wrote in a post on Twitter.
