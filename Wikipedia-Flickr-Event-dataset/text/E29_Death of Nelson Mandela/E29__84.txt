A Statement from the Chief Minister:

“Nelson Mandela is one of the heroes of my generation – a man whose life and actions have changed a nation and inspired people around the world to believe in the value of equality and reconciliation. He was truly a man who let his life speak.

To many, his election as democratic South Africa’s first black president in 1994, was the realisation of a hope which had seemed impossible during his 27 year imprisonment.

His release in 1990 was not only a moment which changed the course of South African history. It sent a singularly powerful global message that perseverance in the pursuit of justice, democracy and human rights could succeed no matter how high the obstacles.

Despite the exceptional hardships he endured, Mr Mandela maintained his belief that peace and reconciliation were the only way to achieve a better future for South Africa. He demonstrated that in the way he led his country out of apartheid and towards a brighter future.

Mandela’s message of forgiveness and reconciliation is still relevant across the world today. My sympathies are with his family and everyone in South Africa on this sad day.”
