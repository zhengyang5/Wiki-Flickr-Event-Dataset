The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Jiri Rusnok has sent a letter of condolence to the President of the Republic of South Africa Jacob Zuma in connection with the death of the former President of the Republic of South Africa and the Nobel Peace Prize Laureat Nelson Mandela.





Your Excellency,

I was deeply saddened by the news about the decease of former president of the Republic of South Africa and Nobel Prize laureate Mr Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.

Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was not only a prominent figure of political and social life in the Republic of South Africa, but also one of the most inspiring world leaders of our times. He embodied the fight against racism and injustice. I highly valued his determination which he showed during uneasy times of South African history as campaigner for human rights, international peacemaker and the first democratically elected president of the Republic of South Africa.

I strongly believe that the legacy of Nelson Mandela will live on and become an inspiration for next generations. Let the Nelson Mandela International Day be a symbol of ideals and legacy of this great world figure and a reminder of the necessity to fight for human rights, freedom and equality.

Your Excellency, please accept my deepest condolences on behalf of myself as well as the Government of the Czech Republic and convey our sympathies to the family and close ones of Mr Mandela.

Respectfully yours,

Jiří Rusnok

Prime Minister of the Czech Republic
