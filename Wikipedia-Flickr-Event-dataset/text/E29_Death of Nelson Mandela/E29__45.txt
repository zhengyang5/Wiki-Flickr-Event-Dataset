After several years of poor health, Mandela passed away on 5th December 2013 at the age of 95. He devoted his life for the fight against the Apartheid regime and establishment of a democratic state of equal citizenship, tolerance, and freedom in South Africa.

Bashir pointed in a message sent to Zuma on Friday to the greatest role played by the late Mandela in fighting for freedom and equality not only in South Africa but also across the world, stressing his great sacrifices in resisting colonialism and serving human objectives.

He considered him a symbol of dignity and struggle for people’s freedom and resistance of colonisation and exploitation of Africans, pointing to Sudan’s acclaimed role in supporting African liberation movements and African leaders who led the struggle against colonization and on top of whom was the late Mandella.

South Africa’s first black president who led the peaceful transition from white-only rule will be laid to rest with a state funeral in his ancestral home in Qunu on Sunday 15 December.

Meanwhile, the chairman of the rebel Sudanese people’s Liberation Movement/North (SPLM-N) and Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), Malik Agar, has also sent a letter to president Zuma expressing condolences on the death of Mandela, describing him as the kindle and the symbol of the freedom fighters and the great African visionary leader.

He said that Mandela "inspired us all to follow his path to freedom", stressing that his legacy would continue to illuminate any path to freedom and democracy.
