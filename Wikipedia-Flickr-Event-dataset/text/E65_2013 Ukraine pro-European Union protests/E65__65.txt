Barroso: EU to continue its dialog with Ukraine on principles of mutual respect, transparency and responsibility

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said that the EU's partnership with the Eastern partners is "a process not against anyone, but for something."

Barroso did not mention Russia, but made it clear that the issue concerns the country.

He said at a press conference after the Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius on Friday that the EU would continue its dialog with its Ukrainian partners "on the key principles of mutual respect, transparency, and individual and collective ownership."

"This is not a process that is against anyone, this is a process for something; it is for democracy, for stability and for prosperity," Barroso said.

"It is not against anyone, because I don't believe anyone should be against democracy, against stability or against prosperity."

He said that the sides had also discussed the energy issue at the summit.

Barroso said that the EU had achieved significant progress in the security of gas supply, making sure that "no European nation is an energy island â€“ isolated from European networks."

Barroso reiterated that the EU's offer to Ukraine in terms of signing an Association Agreement remains on the table.
