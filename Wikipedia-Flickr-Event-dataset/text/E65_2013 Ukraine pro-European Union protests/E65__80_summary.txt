Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich has slammed opposition calls for revolution as a "threat to national security", saying it was time to turn what he called a "shameful page" in Ukraine's history.
"Calls for a revolution pose a threat to national security," Yanukovich told ex-leaders Leonid Kuchma, Leonid Kravchuk and Viktor Yushchenko on Tuesday in a bid to defuse an escalating standoff over a rejected EU pact.
"I want that this dark page is turned and is never allowed to happen again," the embattled Yanukovich said.
There are guilty on both sides," Yanukovich said.
US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland met with top opposition leaders and was also slated to meet with Yanukovich.
