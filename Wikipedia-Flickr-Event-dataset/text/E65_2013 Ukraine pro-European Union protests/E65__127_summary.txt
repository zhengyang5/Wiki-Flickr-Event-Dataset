Kiev (AFP) - Washington's top diplomat in Europe on Friday refused to comment on a leaked phone conversation in which she used the f-word in regards to the EU's handling of the Ukraine crisis.
"I will not comment on a private diplomatic conversation," Victoria Nuland told reporters in Kiev after talks with the opposition and President Viktor Yanukovych.
"Fuck the EU," Nuland allegedly said in what appeared to be a phone conversation with US ambassador to Kiev, Geoff Pyatt, which was uploaded onto YouTube accompanied by Russian-language captions.
In the phone call, Nuland was heard discussing boxer-turned-politician Vitali Klitschko and another opposition leader, Arseniy Yatsenyuk.
A spokeswoman for Klitschko said: "Our position is, it does not make sense to comment conversations whose authenticity has not been confirmed by anyone."
