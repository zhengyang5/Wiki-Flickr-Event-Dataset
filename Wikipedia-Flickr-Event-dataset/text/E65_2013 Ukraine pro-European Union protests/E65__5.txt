Kyiv City Council Secretary Halyna Hereha has closed the 13th session of the city council, which was held on Tuesday in the building of the Solomianska district state administration.

She said this after opposition representatives led by MPs Oleksandr Bryhynets, Yuriy Odarchenko (Batkivschyna faction) and Ihor Miroshnychenko (Svoboda faction) had blocked the holding of the city council's session.

Opposition supporters are continuing to picket the building of the Solomianska district state administration in Kyiv, where the council's meeting took place on Tuesday.

An Interfax-Ukraine correspondent said that more than 200 activists who arrived from Independence Square were rallying at the main entrance to the building. The picket was organized by Batkivschyna, Svoboda and UDAR parties.

The protesters arrived at the building of the district administration with party flags, as well as the flags of Ukraine and the European Union. They are chanting "Down with the Gang," "Glory to Ukraine â€“ Glory to the Heroes."

The entrance to the administrative building was cordoned off by police officers. The situation is calm, and no incidents were recorded.

As reported, Kyiv City State Administration received an application from the Batkivschyna Party for holding a rally (1,000 people) outside the building of the Solomianska district state administration, where the city council's meeting was held on Tuesday, because the building of the Kyiv Town Hall has been occupied by protesters since December 1. The city administrated asked police to maintain public order.
