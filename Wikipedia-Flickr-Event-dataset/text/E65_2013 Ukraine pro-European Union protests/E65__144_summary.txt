The deficit of Ukraine's national budget in 2014 could amount to about 3%, First Deputy Finance Minister Anatoliy Miarkovsky has said at a round table.
"We more realistically focused on the formation of revenues to the budget," he said about the work done on the draft national budget.
He said the reduction of VAT would reduce revenues to the national budget and cheapen imports, but domestic prices might remain unchanged.
Regarding the fulfillment of the national budget for 2013, Miarkovsky said that its deficit for the first 11 months was UAH 46.5 billion.
He noted that UAH 86.3 billion was transferred from the national budget to the Pension Fund in January-November.
