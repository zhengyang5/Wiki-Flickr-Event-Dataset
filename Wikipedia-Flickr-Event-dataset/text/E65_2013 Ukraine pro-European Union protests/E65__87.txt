Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has signed decrees on annual celebration of the Day of Dignity and Freedom on November 21, and the Day of Unity of Ukraine on January 22.

"Ukraine is a place of dignity and freedom. Not one but two revolutions made us like this â€“ our Maidan 2004 that celebrated freedom and the revolution of 2013, the revolution of dignity. It was an extremely difficult test for Ukraine, when Ukrainians showed their European aspirations, dignity and their pursuit for freedom. All that's left for me to do, as a president, is to formalize it and sign the decree on the Day of Dignity and Freedom, which Ukrainians will celebrate on November 21 from here to eternity," the president's press service quoted Poroshenko.

According to him, as before, the country will celebrate the Day of Ukraine's Unity on January 22. "The day of Ukraine's solidarity, the day of unity," the president said.

Earlier, Ukraine celebrated the Day of Unity and Freedom on January 22.

The Association Agreement between Ukraine and EU was to have been signed at a summit meeting of Eastern Partnership in Vilnius held trough November 28-29, 2013. However, on November 21, Ukrainian government decided to stop the preparation for signing the Association Agreement.
