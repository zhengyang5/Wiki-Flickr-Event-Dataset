Money to finance the payment of pensions, wages, social payments, and support of the operation of the housing and utility sector and medical institutions is not being raised due to the actions of the anti-government protesters, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said.
"Dear Ukrainians, money to finance the payment of pensions, wages, social payments, support of the operation of the housing and utility sector and medical institutions do not appear due to unrest in the streets," reads a statement of Azarov posted on his personal Web site.
The premier said that authorities are doing everything possible to ensure the timely financing of the protected articles of the budget, "but today it's hard to do this."
