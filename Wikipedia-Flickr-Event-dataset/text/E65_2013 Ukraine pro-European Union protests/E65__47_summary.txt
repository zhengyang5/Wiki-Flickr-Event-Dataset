European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood policy Stefan Fule expects that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on November 21 will consider and adopt the remaining bills necessary for the signing of the association agreement with the European Union.
"I appreciate the considerable progress that has been made during the last months in this regard," Fule said in a statement made available to Interfax-Ukraine on Wednesday.
The European commissioner confirmed that the EU was committed to bringing EU-Ukraine relations to a new level, opening up new opportunities for the Ukrainian people.
"The door for such a qualitative step forward is open and we look forward to the government's implementation of its decision of September 18, 2013 to sign the association agreement in Vilnius on November 29, 2013," he said.
Fule is visiting Ukraine on November 19-20.
