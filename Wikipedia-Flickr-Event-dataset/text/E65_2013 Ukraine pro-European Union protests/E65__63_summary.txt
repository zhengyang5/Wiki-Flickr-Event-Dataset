European Union leaders and Ukraine have, as expected, failed to sign an historic free-trade deal after a last-minute U-turn from Kiev.
Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovich still attended the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius.
“We want to have a strong relationship with Ukraine, we believe particularly on economic issues,” said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
“It is, of course, for Ukraine to decide what it wishes to do and there have been some good and important discussions with President Yanukovich here.
Its decision not to sign was strongly criticised by the leader of summit host Lithuania, which holds the EU presidency.
