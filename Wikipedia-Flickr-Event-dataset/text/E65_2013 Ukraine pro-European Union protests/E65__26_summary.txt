The real number of people who died during the clashes on the Independence Square (also known as Maidan) and related events is around 780 people, according to the organization of Maidan volunteer doctors.
There were around 200 wounded in the fourth to eighth floors of the Trade Unions House, they could not move independently, some of them could not see, some had brain injuries - they were burned alive.
Corpses were taken from there [Trade Unions House] in black VW vans without number plates to an unknown destination," a medical volunteer, Anastasiya Polischuk, said at a briefing in Kyiv on Thursday.
Over a half of the dead went through volunteer doctors, so they have no doubts in the numbers announced, Polischuk said.
Maidan volunteer doctors believe the Ukrainian authorities intentionally concealed the real number of casualties.
