Consultations on the text of statement were ongoing between GD and UNM lawmakers prior to the vote.
It was the second attempt by the Parliament to adopt a statement on developments in Ukraine.
I do not think that the Georgian Parliament should adopt a statement from a position of being scared and with its head bowed [before Russia],” MP Gabashvili said.
