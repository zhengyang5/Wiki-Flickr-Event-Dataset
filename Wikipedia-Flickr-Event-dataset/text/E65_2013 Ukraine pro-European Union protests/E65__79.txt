"I congratulate all of those who are fighting for our cause, for the idea, themselves and their children. We have our first victories, and that is precisely because we have started these protests all over Ukraine. This is a real pressure on the criminal regime, which has crossed all lines and must go away! " - stated Svoboda's leader Oleh Tiahnybok speaking at Maidan on December 2, 2013.

The leader of the nationalists stressed that Ukrainians will never forgive the regime and the Berkut for the bloodshed of students and children on November 30.

"We will never forgive the monstrous Berkut! Our taxes are used to pay their salaries, but instead of trying to catch bandits and defend Ukrainians - these beasts violently beat innocent people. Thus, our clear political demands are: the impeachment of the President, the resignation of the Government and criminal responsibility for all so-called "law enforcement" agents, who attacked our children, our community.

We all here would like to appeal to all military officers, generals, soldiers and law enforcers, to those with a shred of patriotism and officer's honor: choose our side, do not follow criminal orders and join the Ukrainian revolution! "- urged Oleh Tiahnybok.

Oleh Tiahnybok also stressed there is information that tonight Kyiv's City Administration is going to be under attack. He appealed to the leaders of the Berkut and to those who may follow criminal orders given to them: "Guys, have a conscience. Do not use force and do not go against innocent people. God will punish you, and the people will not forgive!".

Svoboda's leader also asked the participants of the protest to continue picketing the Cabinet and the Parliament: "We have stood through one night and will continue to do so, because we advocate for Ukraine, for the truth. Thus, we shall carry on picketing the Cabinet and the Parliament where a resolution about the resignation of Azarov's Government will be considered! ".
