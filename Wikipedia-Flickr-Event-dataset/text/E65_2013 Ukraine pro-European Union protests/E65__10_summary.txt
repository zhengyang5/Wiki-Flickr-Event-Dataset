Mykola Azarov had offered to step down as prime minister to create "social and political compromise".
Analysis Ukraine's months-old protest movement against President Yanukovych's government will not end suddenly because of the repeal of the controversial "anti-protest" law or Prime Minister Azarov's resignation.
Much also depends on who replaces Mr Azarov, when they take office and how much latitude Mr Yanukovych will allows.
Mr Azarov was deeply unpopular with the opposition, who accused him of mismanaging the economy and failing to tackle corruption.
Mr Azarov's spokesman told the Interfax news agency that Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov would assume temporary leadership of the cabinet.
