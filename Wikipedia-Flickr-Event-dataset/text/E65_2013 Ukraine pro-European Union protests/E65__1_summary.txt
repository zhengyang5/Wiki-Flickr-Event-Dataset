Vladimir Putinâ€™s hope for the future is his Eurasian Union, to be established next January as a rival to the European Union.

Mr. Putin jumped in quickly with cash and low gas prices for Mr. Yanukovych, who then abruptly changed course, refusing to sign it.
This would not be a risk in the Eurasian Union.
