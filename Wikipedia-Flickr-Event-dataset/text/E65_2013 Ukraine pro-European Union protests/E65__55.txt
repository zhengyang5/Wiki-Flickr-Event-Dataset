The European Parliament's monitoring mission - former European Parliament President Pat Cox and former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski - will not be terminated and will continue until the Eastern Partnership Summit.

Cox and Kwasniewski said following a meeting with Verkhovna Rada Chairman Volodymyr Rybak that the mission would last until November 28, the Interfax-Ukraine correspondent reported.

According to Cox and Kwasniewski, Ukraine still has a chance to sign the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement.

It has been reported that on Thursday Ukrainian deputies failed to pass any of the six bills proposed on the treatment of prisoners abroad.
