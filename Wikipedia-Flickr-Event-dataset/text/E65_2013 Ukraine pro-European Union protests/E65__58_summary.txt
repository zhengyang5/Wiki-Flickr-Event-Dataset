Ukraine is facing severe economic problems and is expected to soon need financial assistance of $15 billion or more.
Mr. Putin said it was the Europeans who were trying to pressure Ukraine and refusing to accept its decision to delay the accords.
“This is pressure, this is blackmail,” Mr. Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript of his remarks.
Asked about the phone call between Mr. Yanukovich and Ms. Grybauskaite, Mr. Putin used the moment to take a jab at the United States over its surveillance programs.
“I don’t know what the Ukrainian and Lithuanian presidents discussed — you could maybe ask our American friends,” he said.
