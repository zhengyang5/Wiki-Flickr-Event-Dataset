Photographs and videos have emerged that appear to indicate that the killing of dozens of protesters in Kiev's Independence Square on Feb. 20 was orchestrated by Russian-trained snipers and not local riot police, as the former Ukrainian government and Russian officials have claimed.
They were also captured putting on ski masks to obscure their faces as they left the courtyard, according to The Daily Beast.
Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt told The Daily Beast, "These photographs may be highly important evidence of what happened on Feb. 20.
They add to the urgency for a full and thorough investigation into the shootings in Independence Square.
"Video footage obtained by The Daily Beast shot the day after the violence suggests the SBU was disposing of possible evidence.
