The call appears to have been intercepted and released on YouTube, accompanied by Russian captions of the private and candid conversation.
State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Nuland "has been in contact with her EU counterparts and of course has apologized for these reported comments".
Carney refused to discuss any details of the call, saying "we do not discuss private conversations".
"Assistant Secretary Nuland has been in contact with her EU counterparts and relations with the EU are stronger than ever," he added.
