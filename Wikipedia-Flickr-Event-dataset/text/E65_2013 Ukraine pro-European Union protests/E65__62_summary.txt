Ukraine will soon resume talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych has said.
"We will certainly resume the negotiations.
If there are conditions that suit us, we will take that path," he said at a meeting with the former presidents of Ukraine on Tuesday.
However, Yanukovych once again said that the conditions put forward by the IMF were unacceptable.
"I had a conversation with U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden, who told me that the issue of the IMF loan has almost been solved, but I told him that if the conditions remained... we did not need such loans," the president said.
