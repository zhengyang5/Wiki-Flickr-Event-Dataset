Last night, protesters demonstrated their anti-Russia feelings as they pulled a statue of Lenin to the ground.
After they broke the statue into pieces, the fragments became “the most sought-after souvenir” in the city, the BBC reported.
On Tuesday, past and present Ukrainian leaders will meet, along with representatives from the opposition, to look for a solution.
Meanwhile, the movement continued as protesters constructed barricades and more police moved into place around Independence Square, the focal point of the protests.
