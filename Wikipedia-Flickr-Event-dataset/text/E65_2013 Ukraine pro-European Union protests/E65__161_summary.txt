Even a week ago, the idea of a Russian military intervention in Ukraine seemed farfetched if not totally alarmist.
Expect more of the same if the opposition to Putin’s intervention starts to find its voice.
Its leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has so far remained silent on the Russian intervention in Ukraine.
But on Sunday, all of them announced they had halted their preparations for attending the summit in protest at Russia’s intervention in Ukraine.
No less worrying for Putin would be the economic sanctions the West is preparing in answer to Russia’s intervention in Ukraine.
