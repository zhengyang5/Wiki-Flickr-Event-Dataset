The parliamentary elections held in Ukraine on 28 October were won by the Party of Regions (PR), although they obtained far fewer votes than five years ago, and did not win an absolute majority in parliament.
The post-electoral landscapeThe Party of Regions won the elections, but did not enjoy the success it has expected.
In the light of the Party of Regions’ election results, Viktor Yanukovych’s chances of re-election are now minimal.
The voter turnout was 57.98%, almost the same as in the parliamentary elections of 2007 (57.94%).
It is rather unlikely that the EU and its member states will fail to recognise the results of the parliamentary elections.
