TALLINN (Reuters) - Estonia denied on Wednesday that a leaked telephone call showed that its foreign minister had blamed opponents of Ukraine’s deposed president for sniper killings during last month’s unrest - as Russian media have suggested.
The recording, published on YouTube, was picked up by Russian state television and was the top item on state news agency RIA-Novosti.
At least 88 people were killed in gunbattles between police and anti-government protesters in late February in Ukraine’s worst violence since Soviet times.
“Foreign Minister Paet was giving an overview of what he had heard the previous day in Kiev and expressed concern over the situation on the ground,” it said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has not reacted officially, but Itar-Tass news agency quoted a source at the ministry on Wednesday as saying that Moscow was “surprised” that the EU was not commenting on the intercepted phone chat.
