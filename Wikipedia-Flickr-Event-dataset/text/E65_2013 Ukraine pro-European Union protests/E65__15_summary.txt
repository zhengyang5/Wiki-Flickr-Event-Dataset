Amid the deepest turmoil since the Orange Revolution, Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych’s announcement Thursday that he was taking indefinite sick leave prompted a guessing game among Ukrainians about what was happening to their country.
Some say he is looking for an excuse to avoid further discussions with opposition leaders, which have done nothing to resolve the tensions.
That has been a persistent worry of the opposition since violent clashes two weeks ago killed three protesters.
He isn’t known to have serious health problems, although his office says he has taken sick leave twice before — once for a knee problem and the other time also for a respiratory illness.
Yanukovych must formally sign that repeal and it was unclear whether he could do so while on sick leave.
