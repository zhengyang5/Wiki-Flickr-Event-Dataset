Ukraine would inevitably face crisis if it signed an Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov has said.

"We made such a decision when it became clear that if we sign the agreement, we will face crisis. It was absolutely clear and I can answer for that. So we had nothing left to do but change our mind and find other forms of support for Ukraine," he said on the Shuster Live program on the Inter television channel late on Friday.

Azarov said it was a mistake that the public had not been given clear explanations of such actions by the authorities.

He said he was confident that "history will prove that we were right."

Azarov also said that Ukraine would definitely sign the agreement, but on more favorable terms.
