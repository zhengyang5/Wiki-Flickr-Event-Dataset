Ukrainian Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko said he has no intention of resigning over the events that are happening in the country.

"If I resign, the interior affairs bodies will be affected, and that will prevent an objective investigation into what has occurred," the minister told a press conference in Kyiv.

"I want to investigate all events in an objective manner. I believe I'm in the correct position to do that," he said.

One of the main demands of the Ukrainian opposition is the dismissal of the interior minister for the dispersal of a protest rally in Kyiv in the early hours of November 30 and the beating of protesters on December 1.
