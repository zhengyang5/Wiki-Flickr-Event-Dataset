KIEV, Ukraine -- Protesters took control of Ukraine's capital on Saturday, seizing the president's office as parliament sought to oust him and form a new government.
At the sprawling suburban Kiev compound, protesters stood guard and blocked more radical elements among them from entering the building, fearing unrest.
A group of protesters in helmets and shields stood guard at the president's office Saturday.
Ukraine's parliament, only a day ago controlled by Yanukovych supporters, seemed to be taking control of the country's leadership.
In parliament, opposition leaders Vitaly Klitschko and Oleh Tyahnybok called for discussion of impeachment or forcing the president's resignation.
