Despite last minute attempts by European leaders to save the trade deal with Ukraine, there was no signature on the dotted line.
As the summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius came to an end, both sides stressed the door remained open to signing the agreement in the future.
President Vladimir Putin says the free trade deal would have been a “major threat” to Russia’s economy.
Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovich said the country had not been offered enough economic support from the EU for it to sign the Association Agreement.
He declared the EU offer of 600 million euros in aid “humiliating”.
