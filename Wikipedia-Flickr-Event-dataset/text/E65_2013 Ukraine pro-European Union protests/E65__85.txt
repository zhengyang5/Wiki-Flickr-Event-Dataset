Batkivschyna faction leader Arseniy Yatseniuk has said that it is impossible to resolve the current crisis in Ukraine through parliamentary methods.

"This is not a parliamentary crisis. This is an all-Ukrainian political and economic crisis. It cannot be resolved through parliamentary methods. These decisions are not made here," he said at a press briefing in parliament on Thursday.

Yatseniuk voiced the opposition's demands to the authorities to resolve current problems.

"Our three demands to the Verkhovna Rada and the president remained unchanged: the resignation of the government, the release of all political prisoners, first and foremost, [former Ukrainian Prime Minister] Yulia Tymoshenko, and nine individuals who were illegally convicted [who were present at a rally on Bankova Street on December 1] and the suspension of all criminal cases, and the arrest of all Berkut officers who were involved in the illegal beating up of children on Independence Square," Yatseniuk said.
