European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood policy Stefan Fule expects that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on November 21 will consider and adopt the remaining bills necessary for the signing of the association agreement with the European Union.

"I appreciate the considerable progress that has been made during the last months in this regard," Fule said in a statement made available to Interfax-Ukraine on Wednesday.

"I'm encouraged to see the determination of the President and of Speaker of the Parliament [Volodymyr] Rybak in cooperation with all parliamentary factions to adopt key legislation on November 21, 2013 on parliamentary elections, a new law on the prosecutors general's office and a new law on the medical treatment of prisoners abroad."

The European commissioner confirmed that the EU was committed to bringing EU-Ukraine relations to a new level, opening up new opportunities for the Ukrainian people.

"The door for such a qualitative step forward is open and we look forward to the government's implementation of its decision of September 18, 2013 to sign the association agreement in Vilnius on November 29, 2013," he said.

The EU and many of Ukraine's partners around the globe look forward to such a key step, which would confirm Ukraine's strengthened role in the world and provide a signal of predictability for international financial markets and institutions in stabilizing Ukraine's economy and finances, Fule said.

Fule is visiting Ukraine on November 19-20.
