Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych hopes to sign an association agreement with the European Union at the EU’s Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius on November 28-29.
The association agreement is a big deal: it lays out a roadmap for Ukraine to draw closer to the European Union.
Mr. Yanukovych is clearly hesitant to let Ms. Tymoshenko go.
A number of Mr. Yanukovych’s advisors reportedly have urged him to do what is necessary to sign the association agreement.
But Mr. Yanukovych will lose the opportunity to run on that theme if he misses the opportunity to sign the association agreement.
