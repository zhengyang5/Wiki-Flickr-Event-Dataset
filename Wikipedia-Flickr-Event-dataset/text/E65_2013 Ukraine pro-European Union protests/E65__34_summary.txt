It was part of a national strike by students across Ukraine.
Their intention, they say is to remain on the streets until Friday when the Vilnius summit will begin.
They have added their collective voice to calls for the government to sign the Association Agreement with the EU.
Our correspondent at the protest in Kiev said: “The students say they’ll get back to lectures as soon as they know the outcome of the Vilnius summit.
If Ukraine doesn’t sign the Association Agreement they have not ruled out staying on strike indefinitely.”
