The number of those killed in the Ukrainian violence has risen to 77, the country’s Health Ministry has said.
The surge in the number of victims comes as both armed rioters and the police are now using live ammunition in clashes.
At least 13 officers have been killed and 130 hospitalized with gunshot wounds, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said.
According to the Ukrainian Health Ministry, 562 people have been injured in clashes and 356 hospitalized.
The Ukrainian opposition claims that more than 100 protesters have been killed since the start of the violent riots, counting the wounded as “thousands.”
