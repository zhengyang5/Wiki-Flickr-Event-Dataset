The 11-minute conversation was posted on YouTube – it is the second time in a month that telephone calls between western diplomats discussing Ukraine have been bugged.
The leak came a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the snipers may have been opposition provocateurs.
The Estonian foreign ministry confirmed the leaked conversation was accurate.
It said: "Foreign minister Paet was giving an overview of what he had heard in Kiev and expressed concern over the situation on the ground.
During the conversation, Paet quoted a woman named Olga – who the Russian media identified her as Olga Bogomolets, a doctor – blaming snipers from the opposition shooting the protesters.
