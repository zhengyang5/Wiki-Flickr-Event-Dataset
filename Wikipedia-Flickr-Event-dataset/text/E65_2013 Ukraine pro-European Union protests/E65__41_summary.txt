Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych at the Olympics (David Goldman - Pool/Getty Images)Late Thursday, Ukraine's parliament voted to approve a resolution that calls for the country's security services to pull back and end their crackdown on ongoing protests.
The degree to which Ukraine's security services do or do not obey this resolution is not actually the most important thing here.
What makes this a really big deal is that the parliament is actually as well as symbolically undermining President Viktor Yanukovych â€“ challenging both his handling of the protests as well as the president himself.
It symbolically places Yanukovych, especially if he ignored parliament on this, outside of both the democratic processes and outside rule of law.
But that's been getting tougher and tougher for him, and his own parliament just made it pretty close to official.
