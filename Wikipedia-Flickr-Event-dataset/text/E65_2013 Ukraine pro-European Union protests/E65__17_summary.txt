KIEV, Ukraine - About 40 police officers defected to Ukraine's opposition and marched into the heart of the protest encampment in the Kiev on Friday, the day after violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces killed dozens.
"We wear this uniform, and in this uniform I made a vow to be a servant of the Ukrainian people," said Col. Vasyl Krykovskiy, the head of police in the district of Lviv.
Police officers from Lviv who have arrived to join anti-government protesters appear on a stage in Independence Square in Kiev on Friday.
Krykovsky said he decided to defect once it was clear that police in Kiev had fired on protesters.
Senior Lt. Nazar Bohun said he'd left behind his family to come to Kiev and demonstrate how he felt.
