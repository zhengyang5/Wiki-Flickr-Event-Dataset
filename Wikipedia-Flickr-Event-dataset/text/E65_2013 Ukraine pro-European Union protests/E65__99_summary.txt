Russian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated Russian servicemen on the nation’s Special Forces Day—a holiday marked on the anniversary of when mysterious pro-Russian troops took control of Crimea in 2014.
“We are going to further increase the potential of the special operations forces,” Putin said in a Kremlin video telegram on Monday, referring generally to the rapid response unit created in 2009.
Russia vehemently denied that it had ordered its special forces to carry out the covert operation, an act tantamount to an invasion.
On Monday, Putin made no mention of Crimea, but hailed the special operations troops as modern heirs to the feared Soviet special forces (Spetsnaz), saying that they have already proven their strength under difficult circumstances.
“Having absorbed the glorious, legendary tradition of Russian Spetsnaz, a rich experience of many generations, the special operations forces immediately showed their best side,” he said.
