Sept 25 (Interfax) - Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada Speaker Volodymyr Rybak said that he was certain that the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement would be signed and that no one should tell Ukraine which choice to make.
"I believe that the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement will be signed," Rybak said at a meeting with heads of local executives and self-governing authorities in Uzhgorod on Wednesday.
"These are historical days for Ukraine - for how we will go further and how we will develop," Rybak said.
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych has given the government a task - to establish the European standards in Ukraine, the speaker said.
Ukraine should refrain "from sharp assessments towards Russia," Rybak said.
