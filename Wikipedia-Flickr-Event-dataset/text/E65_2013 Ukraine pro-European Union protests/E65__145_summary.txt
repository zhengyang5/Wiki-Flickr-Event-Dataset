Nothing is threatening Ukraine's economic and financial stability now, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said.
"I can say firmly today that there has been a turning point, and we now have a promising future and strong confidence that we can preserve both social and financial-economic stability.
Nothing is threatening stability of the financial-economic situation in Ukraine now.
Not a single economic factor," Azarov said in opening a government meeting in Kyiv on Wednesday.
