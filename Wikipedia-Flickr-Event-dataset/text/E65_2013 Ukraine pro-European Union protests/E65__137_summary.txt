Ukraine's foreign currency reserves amounted to $18.8 billion as of October, which corresponds to only around 2.2 months of 2012 goods and services imports.
"The National Bank of Ukraine will likely try to stabilize the currency in the event of increased demand for foreign currency.
"While the sovereign can to a large extent rely on state-owned banks and ultimately the central bank to refinance domestic currency denominated debt, repaying debt denominated in foreign currency will prove more difficult.
We estimate that sovereign foreign currency denominated repayments amount to around $10 billion until the end of 2014," according to the experts.
In December 2013, Ukraine has around $244 million of foreign currency denominated debt repayments (principal and interest) due.
