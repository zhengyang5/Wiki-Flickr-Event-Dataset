“ The voted bill will certainly not satisfy the more radical protesters,” said euronews reporter Maria Korenyuk. “The opposition now fear it may finally provoke an even deeper conflict.”

Straight after the parliamentary vote boxer-turned-opposition leader, Vitaly Klitschko, gave his opinion:

“This law, like many others, does not meet the interests of people. And this voted law seems to be like a law of Somali pirates, who take you hostage and then let you free against a ransom,” said Klitschko, UDAR party leader.

Despite the freezing temperatures protesters in Independence Square showed no signs of considering giving up. When asked, many vowed to go on fighting for what they said were their rights.

One described the law as ‘absurd’ because the authorities obviously want things to go back to how they were.

Another said he wouldn’t obey the law and that the protesters will stay until the end fighting for their freedoms.

And a third explained that no-one had trusted the Ukrainian government for a long time and that people would stay until victory.
