It was only declared by President Viktor Yanukovych last night.
The bloodshed started shortly before EU foreign ministers from Germany, France and Poland held talks with Russian-backed President Yanukovych in Kyiv.
“Black smoke, detonations and gunfire around presidential palace… Officials panicky,” tweeted Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski to explain the delay.
The Polish minister later said he was about to meet Ukraine’s opposition to discuss a proposed deal with Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.
Separately, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov likened threats of sanctions to blackmail, RIA news agency reported.
