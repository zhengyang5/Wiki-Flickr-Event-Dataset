A former Berkut commander told Reuters that Berkut officers destroyed documentary evidence that potentially could identify fellow officers.
Videos and photographs appear to show how Berkut officers shot at protesters and beat them with sticks.
Serhiy Bondarchuk, a physics teacher, died of a gunshot wound to the back on the morning of Feb. 20.
He said politics played no role in the prosecution of the three Berkut officers.
Alongside the weaponry were framed photos of two Berkut officers who they said were killed at the demonstrations.
