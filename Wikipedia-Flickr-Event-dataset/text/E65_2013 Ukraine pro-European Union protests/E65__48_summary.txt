Protests have taken place on Tuesday outside the Ukranian parliament in Kiev.
Among the concerns of the EU are the imprisonment of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, whom western governments want freed.
Opposition leader Vitaly Klitschko has urged her to be released as soon as possible “because her case is politically motivated”.
Euronews’ correspondent in Kiev, Maria Korenyuk, said that “every draft law passed in parliament inceases the chances of Ukraine signing the Association Agreement in November”.
However she warned that “despite there not being much time until the Vilnius Summit, MPs are in no hurry to get working.”
