Ukraine has rejected draft laws that would allow the release of a jailed opposition leader, suspended plans for a landmark agreement with the European Union and announced it will renew active dialogue with Russia.
The agreement with the EU would have marked a pivotal shift westwards for the ex-Soviet republic's 46 million people, away from historic Russian ally.
The government instead proposed creating a three-way trade commission between Ukraine, the European Union and Russia that would resolve trade issues between the three sides.
Meanwhile, Putin, whose government piled pressure on Ukraine in the run-up to the summit, said on Thursday that Moscow was not against Ukraine signing the association agreement.
"We are not against Ukraine's sovereign choice whatever it may be," he said, reiterating however the threat of protective measures should Ukraine join forces with Europe.
