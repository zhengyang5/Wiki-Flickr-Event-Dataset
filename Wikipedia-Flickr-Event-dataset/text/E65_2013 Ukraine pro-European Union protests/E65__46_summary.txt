VideoUkrainian President Viktor Yanukovych has pardoned two former government ministers serving prison sentences for abuse of office.
Yuri Lutsenko and Georgy Filipchuk had ties to Mr Yanukovych's opponent, the former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is still serving a seven-year sentence for abuse of power.
The EU has welcomed the pardons as "an important first step" but insists it will not consider closer ties to Ukraine until all of the president's political opponents have been released from prison.
