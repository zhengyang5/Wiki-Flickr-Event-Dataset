The real number of people who died during the clashes on the Independence Square (also known as Maidan) and related events is around 780 people, according to the organization of Maidan volunteer doctors.

"As far as we know, 780 people have died. This number includes about 300 people who disappeared from hospitals (emergency hospitals, other medical institutions), they were taken away and their bodies were burned in crematoria. These people are missing, they are being searched for, but no one can find them... There were around 200 wounded in the fourth to eighth floors of the Trade Unions House, they could not move independently, some of them could not see, some had brain injuries - they were burned alive. Corpses were taken from there [Trade Unions House] in black VW vans without number plates to an unknown destination," a medical volunteer, Anastasiya Polischuk, said at a briefing in Kyiv on Thursday.

This figure includes around 20 dead police, Berkut and other special purpose unit officers. "The rest are 'the heavenly hundred', about whom everyone knows and people who were found outside Maidan - in the woods outside the city - many of them have not been identified by the police as Maidan activists," she said.

Over a half of the dead went through volunteer doctors, so they have no doubts in the numbers announced, Polischuk said. Maidan volunteer doctors believe the Ukrainian authorities intentionally concealed the real number of casualties.

According to official information from the Ukrainian Health Ministry, 104 people died at Kyiv's main square Maidan between November 2013 and February 2014 and most of them died in armed conflict on February 18-20 and were later called "the heavenly hundred."
