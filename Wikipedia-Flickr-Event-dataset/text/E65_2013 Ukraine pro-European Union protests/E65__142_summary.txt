KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian protesters stood their ground on Wednesday after an overnight sweep by riot police and their leaders dismissed an offer of talks from a president they say must quit for favoring ties with Russia over the European Union.
These include the resignation of the president and government and a release of prisoners.
European leaders say the trade pact with Ukraine would have brought investment.
After two hours of talks with the president, she said she had complained to him about police behavior.
This would require reopening talks with Europe and with the International Monetary Fund, which has offered Ukraine loans on conditions which Yanukovich has rejected.
