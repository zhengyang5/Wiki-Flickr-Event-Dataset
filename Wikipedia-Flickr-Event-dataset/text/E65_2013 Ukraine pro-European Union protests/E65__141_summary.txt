Azarov: Full repayment of debt on social payments postponed until end of this year due to protestsProtests in Kyiv and the temporarily blocking of the government have disrupted the schedule for the repayment of debt on social payments and wages, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov has said.
"The repayment schedule will have to be reconsidered," he said, while opening a government meeting in Kyiv on Wednesday.
He gave First Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov, as well as the finance and social policy ministers, a week to draft a new schedule that would help repay the debt by the end of year.
Earlier reports said that the debt would be repaid in full by mid-December.
As reported, the balances on the single treasury account by the beginning of November and December 2013 were UAH 400 million and UAH 1.2 billion respectively, the lowest level since 2003.
