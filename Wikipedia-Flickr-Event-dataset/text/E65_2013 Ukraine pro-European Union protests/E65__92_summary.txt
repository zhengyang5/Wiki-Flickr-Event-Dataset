As Prime Minister Mykola Azarov put it on national television, modernizing Ukrainian industry to EU standards will cost at least 150 billion to 165 billion euros ($203 billion to $224 billion).
Azarov called for the EU, Ukraine and Russia to negotiate a free-trade regime together â€” a proposal that Linas Linkevicius, foreign minister of summit host country Lithuania, said was unprecedented and "not an option."
It was these people who took to the streets on Nov. 24 to demand that Yanukovych sign the EU deal no matter what.
Fewer people are now inclined to fight to the bitter end for their vision of a European Ukraine.
"Europe wants Ukraine to tear itself away from Russia at its own expense," former diplomat Alexander Baunov wrote on Slon.ru.
