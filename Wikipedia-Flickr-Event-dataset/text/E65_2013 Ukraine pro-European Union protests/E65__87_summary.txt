Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has signed decrees on annual celebration of the Day of Dignity and Freedom on November 21, and the Day of Unity of Ukraine on January 22.
It was an extremely difficult test for Ukraine, when Ukrainians showed their European aspirations, dignity and their pursuit for freedom.
According to him, as before, the country will celebrate the Day of Ukraine's Unity on January 22.
"The day of Ukraine's solidarity, the day of unity," the president said.
However, on November 21, Ukrainian government decided to stop the preparation for signing the Association Agreement.
