Europe needs Ukraine and here's why.

Ukraine offers economic growth at Europe’s doorsteps. A predictable and rule-based Ukraine will expand the European market by an extra 45 million consumers with rich resources and great human capital. This is particularly true of the energy market, where gas transit and export of electricity from Ukraine is of strategic importance for the European Union.

Gas transit and export of electricity from Ukraine is of strategic importance for the European Union.

Furthermore, a Ukraine integrated with the E.U. will keep Russian neo-imperialist aspirations from dominating the region through economic intimidation, information propaganda and fueling internal conflicts. Such an approach destabilizes the E.U. Ukraine matters because its trajectory has far-reaching regional implications. Today people in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Russia are watching events in Ukraine to see if Russia is in a position to impose its views in the region. Ukraine sends a strong signal that people power can withstand the pressure from Kremlin and define the destiny of the nation.

Moreover, Europe can tap into Ukraine’s amazing civic spirit and optimism for Europe. This infusion of hope may be puzzling in Athens, London and Madrid, where euroscepticism is growing, but the fact is that the Euromaidan is the largest ever pro-European rally in history. That should give the E.U. confidence to overcome other crises and challenges. Ukraine is right now demonstrating that European civilization can be a powerful symbol of freedom, dignity and democracy.
