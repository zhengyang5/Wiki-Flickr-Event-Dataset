Kyiv has suspended its preparations for the signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement until the solution for the situation is found and industrial production decline and relations with the CIS countries are compensated by the European market, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Boiko said.

"The Ukrainian government will suspend the negotiations for signing the Association Agreement with the EU, until we find a solution for the situation is found and when the drop in industrial production and our relations with CIS countries are compensated by the European market, otherwise our country's economy will sustain serious damage," Boiko said at the news conference in Kyiv on Thursday.
