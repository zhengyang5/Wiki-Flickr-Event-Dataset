Yanukovych's Time Is Up in Ukraine; the West Must PrepareThe Ukrainian drama has taken a drastic turn.
In the parliament, Yanukovych no longer seems to have the support of more than 125 out of 450 deputies.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia provided credits and ended multiple sanctions against Ukraine in his support of Yanukovych on December 17, 2013.
With Ukraine high and dry as a result of Russia's strong-arm tactics, the West faces a big agenda for Ukraine.
To reimpose sanctions would violate Russia's commitments to the WTO, and the West should prepare an appropriately severe response.
