The crisis in Ukraine continues to erode the country’s financial standing.
S&P analysts said the latest developments in the crisis make it less likely Ukraine would receive desperately needed Russian aid, thereby increasing the risk of default on its debts.
“The downgrade reflects our view that the political situation in Ukraine has deteriorated substantially.
We believe that this raises uncertainty regarding the continued provision of Russian financial support over the course of 2014, and puts the government’s capability to meet debt service at increasing risk,” S&P said in a statement.
That news caused Ukraine’s dollar bonds and the hryvnia currency to firm against the dollar from record lows hit this week.
