KIEV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's embattled president Viktor Yanukovych decided to go on sick leave Thursday as the country's political crisis continued without signs of resolution.
A statement on the presidential website Thursday said Yanukovych was on sick leave due to an acute respiratory illness and high fever.
Yanukovych is under pressure after two months of major protests seeking his resignation, early elections and other demands.
The parliament voted earlier in the week to repeal harsh anti-protest laws, but Yanukovych must formally sign that repeal.
The amnesty measure was put forth by a lawmaker from Yanukovychâ€™s party as the president casts about for a way to end the protests.
