If you’re headed to worship, work or play on Super Bowl Sunday, don’t count on taking a light-rail train to get there.
West of Stadium Village, trains will carry only ticket holders to the stadium, and beyond.
“As security needs related to the Super Bowl became apparent during planning, we decided to provide people without Super Bowl tickets a way to complete their trips without being delayed by security measures.”Some riders weren’t buying it, though.
Super Bowl Host Committee Vice President Kyle Chank said ticket holders will be encouraged to board light-rail trains rather than driving into downtown Minneapolis.
The buses will run before, during and after the game until the light-rail trains are back on their regular schedules.
