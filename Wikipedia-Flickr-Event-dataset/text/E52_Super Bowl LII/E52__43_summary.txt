Kelly Clarkson has been recruited to headline the NFL’s official Super Bowl warm-up parties on game day in downtown Minneapolis.
The original “American Idol” will perform at the 52 Live bash on the afternoon of Sunday, Feb. 4, a pre-game party for Super Bowl LII ticket holders at the Armory, two blocks from U.S. Bank Stadium.
Different VIP ticket packages are being sold to the game via SuperBowl.com with varying party options, ranging in price from $6,300 to $13,500.
The parties were organized by the NFL’s hospitality subsidiary, On Location Experiences (OLE), which sells the different Super Bowl ticket and travel packages.
OLE now owns Nomadic Entertainment, the company putting on the Club Nomadic and Nomadic Live parties Feb. 1-4 at both the downtown Armory and Mystic Lake Casino Hotel in Prior Lake.
