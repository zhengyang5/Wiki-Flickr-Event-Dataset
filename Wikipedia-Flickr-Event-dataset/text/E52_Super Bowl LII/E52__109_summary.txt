Not only did the first half of Super Bowl LII give us a missed extra point by the Eagles, but it also gave us one of the wildest field-goal misses in Super Bowl history.
With just over 14 minutes left to play in the second quarter, Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski lined up for what should have been an easy 26-yard field goal.

Gostkowski's kick was the shortest missed field goal in the Super Bowl since Morten Andersen also missed a 26-yarder in Super Bowl XXXIII.
