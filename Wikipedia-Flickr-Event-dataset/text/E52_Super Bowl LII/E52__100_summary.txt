President Trump released a pre-Super Bowl message Sunday thanking the Armed Forces “for our freedom as we proudly stand for the National Anthem,” and he wasn’t wrong.
Apparently all players on the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles stood for “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Super Bowl LII, bringing a low-key end to a season marked by a highly charged debate over the take-a-knee protests.
The NBC cameras scanning the sidelines showed no players kneeling or sitting during the anthem, performed by Pink, who was battling the flu.
