Last night’s Super Bowl is now pegged as the 10th most watch program in American TV history just after the M.A.S.H.
The most watched Super Bowl halftime show is Katy Perry’s shark-filled 2015 performance at Super Bowl XLIX with its total TV audience of 120.7 million.
All in all, Super Bowl LII is currently the lowest rated since Super Bowl XLIV in 2010, when the New Orleans Saints thrashed the Indianapolis Colts on CBS.
That first Super Bowl appearance and win for the Saints garnered a 46.4 in metered market ratings.
We’ll update with more Super Bowl and This Is Us numbers plus the ratings for the Justin Timberlake halftime show as we get them later today.
