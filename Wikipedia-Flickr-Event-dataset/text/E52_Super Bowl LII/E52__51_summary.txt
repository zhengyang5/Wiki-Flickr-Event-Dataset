Nomadic Entertainment Group, the traveling concert and party producers, will build a second pop-up venue for 9,000 fans at Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake for high-end concerts.
Concerts at the Prior Lake venue, called "Club Nomadic," begin Feb. 1 and run through game day.
The Super Bowl in Houston featured a Nomadic pop-up venue for the first time.
