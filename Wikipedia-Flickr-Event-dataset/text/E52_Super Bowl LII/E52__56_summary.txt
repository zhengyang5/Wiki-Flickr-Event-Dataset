Super Bowl tickets go on sale Friday for foodies who want to get in on the party action.
The "Taste of the NFL" event takes place the evening of Feb. 3 at the RiverCentre in St. Paul.
The event, which started at the 1992 Super Bowl in Minneapolis, features food from all 32 cities and states with NFL teams.
Tickets to the event give guests access to free food from some well-known chefs and restaurants as well as wine pairings and an open bar.
Chef Thomas Boemer, the magician behind the fried chicken at Revival, represents the Twin Cities at Taste events.
