MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) â€” A homeless shelter across the street from U.S. Bank Stadium is planning a temporary move during the Super Bowl.
Conversations about how to continue meals and shelter during the Super Bowl began years ago, before Minnesota was selected as the host.
The Super Bowl Host Committee said people in the area surrounding the stadium will face airport-like security.
St. Olaf Catholic Church six blocks away answered the call to become a temporary shelter.
The Super Bowl Host Committee will cover the cost of any expenses incurred as a result of the move to a temporary location.
