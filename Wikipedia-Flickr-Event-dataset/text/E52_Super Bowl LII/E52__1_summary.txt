And this time around, it will be on the biggest stage possible, with Philadelphia opening as a pretty large underdog to the Patriots in Super Bowl LII.
According to multiple sportsbooks, the Patriots will open up as 5.5-point favorites over the Eagles in the Super Bowl.
They routinely attract a ton of money from Joe Gambler, and in an event like the Super Bowl, there will be plenty of cash on New England.
They have Brady and Bill Belichick and should get Rob Gronkowski back from a concussion with two weeks to go before the Super Bowl.
When these two teams last met in the Super Bowl, way back in February of 2005, the Patriots were 7-point favorites against Philadelphia and would end up winning 24-21.
