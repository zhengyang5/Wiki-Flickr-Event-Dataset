The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in a thrilling Super Bowl 52, for the first Super Bowl title in franchise history.
Merrill Reese has been the radio voice of the Eagles since 1977, so he’s been waiting 41 years for the chance to call a Philadelphia Super Bowl victory.
Here’s his call of the final play on 94.1 WIP-FM, with former Eagles wide receiver Mike Quick joining him as the color commentator:“Eagles by 8.
The Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl champions!
Let the celebration begin!”Earlier in the week, Reese told Philly.Com that his potential championship call would be “spontaneous” and “from [his] heart.”
