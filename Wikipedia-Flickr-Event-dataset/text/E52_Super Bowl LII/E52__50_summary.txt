Florida Georgia Line’s Feb. 3 concert will happen inside the 2,100-seat Mystic Lake Showroom, where most major concerts at the casino typically take place.
Club Nomadic was named after Mystic Lake’s partner in the venture, Nomadic Entertainment, a bicoastal company owned by the NFL’s hospitality arm, On Location Experiences.
Nomadic Entertainment is also hosting another Super Bowl concert series, Nomadic Live, in downtown Minneapolis at the newly renovated Armory with Imagine Dragons, Pink, Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Lopez from Feb. 1-4.
In a statement, Nomadic Entertainment said: “We are disappointed Mystic Lake is choosing not to bring the Club Nomadic Experience to the people of the Twin Cities.
“It’s the Super Bowl, so we’re thinking super thoughts,” Mackin said.
