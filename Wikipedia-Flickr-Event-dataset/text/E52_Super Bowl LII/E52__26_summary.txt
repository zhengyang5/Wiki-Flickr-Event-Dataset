Sure, Super Bowl LII is technically a rematch of that game.
In lieu of watching the Pro Bowl, I took a trip down memory lane on Sunday and, with the help of YouTube, flipped on an old broadcast of that Super Bowl.
He was a two-time Super Bowl MVP who’d gotten off to the best postseason start for any quarterback ever, posting a sterling 8-0 playoff record and becoming the youngest QB to start his third Super Bowl.
You don’t see many guys in the mold of Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, who checked in for Super Bowl XXXIX at 6-foot-1 and 262 pounds.
While the players, coaches, schemes, and styles have changed, the overall identity and character of the game we saw in Super Bowl XXXIX was all too familiar.
