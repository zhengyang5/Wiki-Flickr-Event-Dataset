Justin Timberlake tweeted on Sunday afternoon that he will perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2018.
The game is set for Sunday, Feb. 4 at Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium.
Timberlake’s announcement was the latest installment in his ongoing bromance with Jimmy Fallon, beginning with the two of them asking “Do you have the time?” in jokey British accents, which evolves into “You’re doing the halftime show at the Super Bowl?!?
Despite the furor around that appearance, it doesn’t seem completely unlikely that Jackson could make a surprise appearance during the performance.
Timberlake is also expected to release a new album in the first quarter of the new year, say sources.
