The Vikings, of course, could become the first team to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium.
The NFC team always was designated to use the Vikings’ locker room and the Vikings’ sideline.
The Super Bowl field will have one end zone painted for each team and the NFL and Super Bowl markings on other parts of the field.
The number of tickets provided to the two participating teams will remain equal should the Vikings play in the game.
Each team will receive the traditional participating team allocation, and then the host club allocation will be split between the two participating teams.
