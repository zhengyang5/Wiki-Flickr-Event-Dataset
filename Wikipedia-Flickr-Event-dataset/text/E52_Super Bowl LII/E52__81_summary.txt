NBC is slated to broadcast Super Bowl LII from U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on February 4, 2018.
The company is in the midst of what Marcondes said was a multi-year Super Bowl sponsorship that would take it through NBCâ€™s 2018 broadcast of Super Bowl LII.
So if the brewer behind Super Bowl staples like Bud Light is focused on the numbers, maybe others should be, too.
In 2016 and 2017, however, CBS and Fox both declined to acknowledge in public whether they had achieved that feat for Super Bowl 50 or Super Bowl LI.
NBC announced it sold out ads for Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 with just days to go before kickoff.
