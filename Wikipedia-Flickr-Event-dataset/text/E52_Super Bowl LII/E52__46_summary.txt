Add another big name to the list of music acts braving Minnesota’s low temperatures to play a high-buck concert during Super Bowl week: “Radioactive” rockers Imagine Dragons will hit the Armory in Minneapolis on the Thursday night before the big game, Feb. 1.
General-admission tickets to the 7 p.m. show — part of the Club Nomadic concert series presented by NFL affiliate Nomadic Entertainment — will be available to the general public for $175 starting Friday at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster.
Rapper Machine Gun Kelly and newcomer Mura Masa will open the concert, a promotional party for video game company EA Sports.
After decades of deterioration, the historic Armory is being remade into a hi-fi entertainment venue in time for SBLII.
Imagine Dragons also came to Minneapolis to perform in 2014 when the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held at Target Field.
