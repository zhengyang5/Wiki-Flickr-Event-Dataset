Looks like a small number of Justin Timberlake fans will be using Paisley Park’s temporary liquor license during Super Bowl week to pop some champagne.
Should Timberlake opt to perform that night -- Prince himself usually kept Paisley visitors guessing -- 36-year-old pop star would have 2½ days to rest up for the Super Bowl halftime show at U.S. Bank Stadium that Sunday.
JT's lumberjacky new album, “Man of the Woods,” comes out the day after the party at Paisley.
Earlier this week, the Chanhassen City Council approved Paisley Park’s request for a temporary liquor license -- good from Jan. 29-Feb. 5 -- to host parties around the Super Bowl.
Just bought tickets to Amex + Justin Timberlake: Man of the Woods.
