NBC has slotted breakout drama This Is Us behind the Super Bowl on Feb. 4, announcing the move as “putting the No.1 drama on television behind the No.1 telecast on television.”The Super Bowl airing will come as This Is Us will move to a new night next fall, becoming a Thursday 9 PM anchor.
Because of Thursday Night Football, This Is Us will air six episodes, followed by a six-week preemption for football.
It will then return in January before going off again for a couple of weeks for NBC’s coverage of the Winter Olympics.
Because of the preemptions, “We are thinking about doing a special Christmas episode,” NBC topper Bob Greenblatt said during a press call on Sunday.
Needless to say, NBC brass are rooting for the Steelers to make it to Super Bowl 2018.
