The St. Paul Winter Carnival will build an icy edifice after all.
Carnival officials announced Thursday they will erect a 7-story, $800,000 ice castle in Rice Park.
While the 1992 castle on Harriet Island drew an estimated 2.5 million visitors to St. Paul, its $1.1 million cost helped drive the Winter Carnival into bankruptcy.

The Winter Carnival has been a way for the entire community to gather and celebrate winter for 132 years.
