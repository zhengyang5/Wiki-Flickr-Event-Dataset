If the recently ratings-challenged NFL wanted to avoid any semblance of controversy with the Super Bowl LII halftime show, today’s performance by Justin Timberlake certainly succeeded – kind of.
In fact, it looks like avoidance was the motto of Timberlake’s third stint in the Super Bowl spotlight.
Despite the rumors and then the denials, there really wasn’t a surprise appearance by Jackson, a reunion of NSYNC’s 2001 Super Bowl halftime show or a hologram of the hometown icon today onstage with Timberlake.
It’s not like he didn’t have an opportunity at hand with Jennifer Lopez among The Tonight Show host, Bradley Cooper, Floyd Mayweather and other big names in the stadium watching the Eagles and Patriots’ Super Bowl rematch today.
In the end, what we saw tonight from the sometimes audio-plagued Timberlake was the Super Bowl halftime equivalent of the screen going black earlier due to “equipment failure” for around 20 seconds on Sunday during the second quarter.
