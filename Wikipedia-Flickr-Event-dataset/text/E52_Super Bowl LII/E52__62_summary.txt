With less than six months until showtime, St. Paul has a large and expanding list of activities planned around the first week in February.
The Super Bowl is expected to bring $400 million of new spending in Minnesota, according to the local Super Bowl Host Committee.
The direct economic benefit to St. Paul remains to be seen.
Along with coordinating the variety of St. Paul-based events, city staff members are also trying to ensure peopleâ€™s safety during the Super Bowl.
Minneapolis plans to use part of the host committee funds to reimburse other agencies, like St. Paul police, that help with security.
