NFL fans can watch this season's playoff games and Super Bowl LII on the go courtesy of Verizon, starting this weekend, Oath CEO Tim Armstrong told CNBC.
"Consumers in the U.S. will be able to watch all four playoff games with one click on the Yahoo Sports app," Armstrong said Tuesday on "Squawk on the Street."
Starting this weekend, playoff games and Super Bowl LII will be available to stream on mobile via the Yahoo Sports app, Verizon said in a release Tuesday.
More livestreamed games will be available next season, including preseason, Thursday Night Football, Sunday Night Football, Monday Night Football, local market games and playoff matches.
Previously only Verizon customers could watch livestreamed mobile games.
