Jennifer Lopez and the Chainsmokers are the latest acts to book concerts in the Twin Cities during the week of the Super Bowl.

Lopez will perform Feb. 3 at the newly renovated Armory in downtown Minneapolis. Ticket details will be announced soon.

The Chainsmokers will headline the pop-up nightclub Club Nomadic at Mystic Lake Casino on Feb. 1. The $200 tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday through Ticketmaster, with $1,500 VIP tickets also available.

Lopez, 48, counts actress, dancer and fashion designer among her many job titles. Her recording career began with 1999’s “If You Had My Love” and she has since scored a series of hits that include “Waiting for Tonight,” “Love Don’t Cost a Thing,” “I’m Real,” “Jenny from the Block,” “On the Floor,” “Dance Again” and “Ain’t Your Mama.”

In January 2016, she kicked off a successful residency at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas that’s currently scheduled to end in May with a total of 108 performances. Lopez also stars in the NBC crime drama “Shades of Blue,” which is set to return for its third season in the new year.

Lopez’s performance will be broadcast live on AT&T Audience Network and DirectTV Now.

Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall formed the Chainsmokers in 2012 and hit the charts two years later with “#Selfie.” The dance music duo have since haunted pop radio with “Roses,” “Don’t Let Me Down,” “Closer,” “All We Know,” “Paris” and “Something Just Like This.”

The two shows join an increasingly packed concert schedule that includes the Dave Matthews Band headlining St. Paul’s Xcel Energy Center on Feb. 3 and Florida Georgia Line playing Mystic Lake Casino’s Club Nomadic the same night.
