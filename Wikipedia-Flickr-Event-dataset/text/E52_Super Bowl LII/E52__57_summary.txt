For 10 days during Super Bowl LII, thrill seekers will be able to see Minneapolis from an entirely new perspective.
Those who dare to brave the cold will have the opportunity to fly across the Mississippi River suspended 100 feet in the air on a zipline.
The Bold North Zipline is one of the many attractions at the 10-day Super Bowl Live event that will include free concerts, food and fun.
The company also built the zipline for the Super Bowl in Indianapolis in 2012 and for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
Minneapolis Mayor-Elect Jacob Frey announced at a press conference that he will be the first to travel across the Mississippi River on the zipline.
