An event featuring Super Bowl LII players and coaches and Minnesota Vikings “legends” is set for Jan. 29 at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul to kick off 10 days of festivities.
The event — known as Super Bowl Opening Night Fueled by Gatorade — allows fans to watch the opposing teams interact with national media before the game.
“Super Bowl Opening Night is one of the many ways that football fans can make their own Super Bowl memory at public events across the Twin Cities during our 10-day festival.
We are excited to start Super Bowl week in St. Paul with a great fan-focused, family-friendly event,” said Andrea Mokros, vice president of communications and events for the Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee, in the news release.
Super Bowl LII will take place Feb. 4 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.
