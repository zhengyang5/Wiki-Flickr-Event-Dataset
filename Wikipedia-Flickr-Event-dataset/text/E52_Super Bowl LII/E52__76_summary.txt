Verizon has long held exclusive rights to mobile streaming of live NFL games, offering the content as a lure to its own subscribers.
Today, the telecoms company announced a new deal with the sports league which will see games streamed to mobile devices regardless of carrier.
From the 2018 playoffs in January onwards, customers with any mobile carrier will be able to access NFL games through the official NFL Mobile app, Yahoo Sports app, and go90, Verizon’s on-demand streaming service.
“We’re making a commitment to fans for Verizon’s family of media properties to become the mobile destination for live sports,” said Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam, Chairman in a press statement.
“The NFL is a great partner for us and we are excited to take its premier content across a massive mobile scale so viewers can enjoy live football and other original NFL content where and how they want it.”
