Plenty of movies and TV shows rolled out first-look trailers during Sunday’s Super Bowl broadcast. But only Netflix Inc. teased something that viewers could watch just hours later.

Netflix NFLX, +3.35% debuted a trailer for “The Cloverfield Paradox” at the end of the first quarter. And then came the bombshell: The movie would drop Sunday night, right after the game ended.

The news came as a complete surprise. Fans had not seen any teasers or production photos from the film, which until very recently was known by another name — “God Particle.”

It was an unprecedented, almost-instant movie rollout in front of likely the largest TV audience of the year, and it could have major implications for the future.

Typically, the network airing the Super Bowl tries to piggyback on the game’s massive ratings by scheduling a highly anticipated new series, or a special episode of a popular series, to follow the game. On Sunday, for example, NBC aired a special episode of its hit drama “This Is Us.” Rival networks largely stay on the sidelines Super Bowl night, knowing whatever they air will get demolished in the ratings. But if “The Cloverfield Paradox” proves to be a hit, Netflix could make the post-Super Bowl timeslot a regular event, building a level of hype and expectations for a streaming surprise every year — and posing a further challenge to broadcast TV.

”The Cloverfield Paradox” is the third installment of a sci-fi series produced by J.J. Abrams. Directed by Julius Onah, it stars a diverse though lesser-known cast of Elizabeth Debicki, Daniel Bruhl, Gugu Mbatha Raw, Chris O’Dowd, Ziyi Zhang and David Oyelowo.

Viacom Inc.’s VIA, +1.80% Paramount had planned to release the film in theaters in April, but Netflix reportedly acquired it last month at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was reportedly made for about $45 million.
