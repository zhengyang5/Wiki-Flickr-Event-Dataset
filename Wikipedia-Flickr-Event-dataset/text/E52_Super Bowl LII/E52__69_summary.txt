This presentation marks the fourth consecutive season Universo (previously Mun2) will televise NFL games, and the second consecutive NBC Super Bowl with the exclusive offering (Super Bowl XLIX in 2015).
Prior to Super Bowl LII, Universo will air three of NBC’s “Thursday Night Football” games, NBC’s annual Thanksgiving night game, and NBC’s two NFL Playoff games.
Universo’s telecasts will also be streamed live via the Telemundo Deportes En Vivo app and TelemundoDeportes.com.
Telemundo digital platforms will also stream additional games in Spanish, including all of NBC’s remaining “Thursday Night Football” and “Sunday Night Football” games, featuring the SAP offering.
"We are thrilled to again present NFL regular-season and playoff games, including the Super Bowl, on Universo to the growing Hispanic football audience,” said Ray Warren, president of Telemundo Deportes.
