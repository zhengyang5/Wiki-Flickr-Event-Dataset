But even if they fall short of reaching Super Bowl LII at U.S. Bank Stadium on February 4, football fans venturing to Minneapolis for the big weekend will be in for a treat.
When you need to warm up, sprint a few blocks over to the Super Bowl Experience, an interactive theme park taking place at the Minneapolis Convention Center from January 27 to February 3.
Jimmy Butler and Co. will battle the Milwaukee Bucks (February 1) and New Orleans Pelicans (February 3) at the Target Center, a venue thatâ€™s just an eight-minute Uber ride from the Super Bowl Experience.
Of course, Super Bowl weekend is traditionally a great time to catch live music as well.
Just shy of a mile from the stadium, Four-Star Hotel Ivy, A Luxury Collection Hotel is sold out during Super Bowl weekend, but you can still go there for a fine meal.
