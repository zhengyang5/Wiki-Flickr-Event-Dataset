The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, who was considering walking away from professional football just last offseason, won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award after leading Philly past the New England Patriots, 41-33, in Super Bowl LII.
The first quarterback to lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl title, Foles made history in more ways than one, also becoming the first player to throw and catch a touchdown in the same game in Super Bowl history.
Foles' journey to the Super Bowl podium was a long one.
During his historic 2013 season, Foles put up a still unmatched 27:2 TD-INT ratio and a league-best 119.2 QB rating.
The Patriots did a great job of kind of nullifying some of that," Pederson said of his game plan heading into Super Bowl LII.
