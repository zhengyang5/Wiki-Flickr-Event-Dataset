The third of three big-name music acts to perform at the Armory in downtown Minneapolis in the run-up to Super Bowl LII will be Pink, promoters announced Thursday.
The singer will perform Feb. 2 at “Nomadic Live!” ahead of the Feb. 4 game a few blocks away at U.S. Bank Stadium.
General admission tickets for Pink go on sale for $225 (plus fees) starting Tuesday through Ticketmaster.com.
About five weeks after the Super Bowl concert, Pink comes back for a concert at the Xcel Energy Center on March 12.
After decades of deterioration, the historic Armory is being remade into a hi-fi entertainment venue in time for the showcase game.
