This time, the Eagles — the Patriots’ Super Bowl opponent on Sunday — have an inside edge thanks to two signings made last spring, well before either team anticipated this matchup.
Eagles running back LeGarrette Blount and defensive end Chris Long were part of the Patriots’ Super Bowl victory over the Atlanta Falcons a year ago.
Long and Blount have been mined by the Eagles for information on the Patriots, their former employer.
“Obviously they’re going to change stuff up.”Assumptions are quickly made about the Patriots, five-time Super Bowl champions of this millennium.
While chasing his first Super Bowl ring last season in New England, Long noted his mind obviously wasn’t on collecting information for future use.
