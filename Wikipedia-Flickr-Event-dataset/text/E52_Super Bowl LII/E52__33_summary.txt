Light-rail transit riders in downtown Minneapolis will face an interruption in the 48 hours before Super Bowl LII next February.
Beginning late Feb. 2, a Friday, trains wonâ€™t stop at the U.S. Bank Stadium plaza because of tightening security for the Super Bowl on Sunday.
Green and Blue line trains will still pick up and dropoff passengers at the stops right before and after the stadium.
Super Bowl planners say security requires the bypass of the U.S. Bank Stadium stop for those two days.
Protection for the Super Bowl will be as extensive as anything seen for an event in the Twin Cities.
