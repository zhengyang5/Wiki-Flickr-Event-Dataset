SUPER BOWL LII OFFICIALS NAMED

Referee GENE STERATORE will lead the seven-person crew of on-field game officials selected to work Super Bowl LII on Sunday, February 4 at U.S. Bank Stadium, the NFL announced today.​

The other members of the Super Bowl LII officiating crew are ROY ELLISON (umpire), JERRY BERGMAN (down judge), BYRON BOSTON (line judge), TOM HILL (field judge), SCOTT EDWARDS (side judge), and PERRY PAGANELLI (back judge). Collectively, the Super Bowl LII officiating crew has 127 years of NFL officiating experience and 101 combined playoff game assignments.

Steratore, in his 15th season as an NFL game official, entered the league in 2003 as a field judge and was promoted to referee in 2006. He has officiated 11 playoff games, including two conference championships. He was the alternate referee for Super Bowl XLIV.

Under the NFL officiating program's evaluation system, officials must be rated in the top tier at their position to be eligible for the Super Bowl. They must have at least five years of NFL experience and previous playoff assignments.

PAUL WEIDNER is the replay official.

Steratore and Bergman are officiating in their first Super Bowl. Previously, both were alternates (Steratore in XLIV; Bergman in 50.) Boston (XXXIV and XLVII) and Hill (XL and XLIX) will officiate their third Super Bowl. Ellison (XLIII), Edwards (50) and Paganelli (XLI) will work their second Super Bowl. Edwards was also an alternate in Super Bowl XLVIII.
