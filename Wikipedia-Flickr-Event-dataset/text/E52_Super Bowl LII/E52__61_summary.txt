The specter of the financially ruinous 1992 ice palace still haunts St. Paul’s Winter Carnival.
Noting that the palace built on Harriet Island for the 1992 Super Bowl nearly sunk the century-old festival, this year’s organizers called off a planned supersized ice palace to coincide with Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis.
These bills drove the St. Paul Winter Carnival Association out of business.
The St. Paul Festival and Heritage Foundation was created to replace it that same year.
The 2018 Winter Carnival will be extended a week to coincide with other Super Bowl activities from Jan. 25 to Feb. 10.
