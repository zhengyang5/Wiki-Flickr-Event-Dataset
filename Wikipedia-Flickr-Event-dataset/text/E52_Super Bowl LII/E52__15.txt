The NFL is going to either send Super Bowl LII to a place where it’s cold, or a place where there may or may not be lights.

The three finalists for a bit for the 2018 title game were announced Tuesday, and they’re Minneapolis, Indianapolis and New Orleans.

The Vikings will have a new stadium by then, and a Super Bowl has always been viewed as a carrot to get someone to help pay for a new building. And while not regularly thought of as a tourist destination, Indianapolis impressed everyone with their organization and charm when hosting two years ago.

New Orleans is part of the regular rotation, and even when the power goes out in the middle of the game, is a guaranteed good time.

The Saints’ hometown is also hoping history plays a factor, as the game would be part of the city’s Tricentennial celebration.

The bids will be presented to owners at their spring meeting next May.
