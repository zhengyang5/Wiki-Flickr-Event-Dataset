The league announced Monday that Pink -- or P!NK -- will perform the national anthem before kickoff on Feb. 4 in Minneapolis.
Pink follows in the footsteps of country star Luke Bryant, who sang the "Star Spangled Banner" at Super Bowl LI in Houston.
Did you know Kathy Lee Gifford handled duties at Super Bowl XXIX (49ers vs. Chargers)?
Or that Beyonc√© was the performer the last time Timberlake played halftime in Super Bowl XXXVIII (Patriots vs. Panthers)?
Would you be surprised to know that Cher got things going before the Broncos and Falcons kicked off Super Bowl XXXIII?
