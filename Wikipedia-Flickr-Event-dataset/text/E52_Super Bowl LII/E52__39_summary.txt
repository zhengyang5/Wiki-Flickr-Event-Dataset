The Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee has already raised $50 million three months before the game.
To compare, Houston had $70 million for the 2017 Super Bowl, but $30 million of that was a public subsidy from the state of Texas.
The host committee’s biggest responsibility is Super Bowl Live on Nicollet Mall.
Super Bowl organizers have spent more than a year working on the street plans with city and regional officials.
That’s the main corner of activity for Super Bowl Live.
