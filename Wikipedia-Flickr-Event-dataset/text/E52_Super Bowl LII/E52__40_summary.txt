Super-producers Jimmy “Jam” Harris and Terry Lewis are keeping their pledge to showcase Minnesota music in the 10-day “Super Bowl Live” concert series on Nicollet Mall — and they’re going above and beyond in honoring the old boss who once fired them.
Mayor Betsy Hodges, Jimmy “Jam” Harris, left, and Terry Lewis cooked up some Super Bowl plans Friday at a press conference.
She is also due to perform the day of Super Bowl LII, Feb. 4, in a pre-game party at the newly refurbished Minneapolis Armory.
It’s not unusual for the Super Bowl Live series to go local music-wise.
Harris and Lewis were announced as the producers of the concert series in October, but they ran into some airplane trouble that kept them from attending a press conference then.
