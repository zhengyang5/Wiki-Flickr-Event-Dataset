The third of three big-name music acts to perform at the Armory in downtown Minneapolis in the run-up to Super Bowl LII will be Pink, promoters announced Thursday.

The singer will perform Feb. 2 at “Nomadic Live!” ahead of the Feb. 4 game a few blocks away at U.S. Bank Stadium.

Jennifer Lopez is already booked for Feb. 3, and Imagine Dragons will take the stage on Feb. 1.

General admission tickets for Pink go on sale for $225 (plus fees) starting Tuesday through Ticketmaster.com.

Tickets are also on sale with different VIP game ticket packages.

About five weeks after the Super Bowl concert, Pink comes back for a concert at the Xcel Energy Center on March 12.

After decades of deterioration, the historic Armory is being remade into a hi-fi entertainment venue in time for the showcase game. Capacity is pegged at roughly 8,000.

The floor is expected to fit about 4,000 standing guests and there will be two levels of open balconies on the sides. Two levels of parking will also be available in the building.
