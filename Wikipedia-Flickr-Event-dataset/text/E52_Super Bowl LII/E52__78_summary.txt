But even though NBC has the rights for next year's Super Bowl, he won't be in Minneapolis for it.
"The one game that we get every three years, that you canâ€™t wait for, and I will be in Korea," Tirico said last week.
It is the first time since 1992 that a network has had both the Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl in the same year.
The Super Bowl takes place Feb. 4, four days before the start of the Winter Olympics, which run Feb. 8-25.
"It is an unusual platform to get to promote the Olympics during the Super Bowl," said Jim Bell, executive producer for NBC's Olympic coverage.
