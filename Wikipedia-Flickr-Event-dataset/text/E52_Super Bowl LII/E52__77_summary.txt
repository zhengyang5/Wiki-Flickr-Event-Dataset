When NBC announced the broadcast team for its upcoming Super Bowl coverage, it was tough not to notice which name was missing.
Bob Costas, maybe the most pedigreed employee at NBC Sports, will not be part of the network’s studio team at America’s marquee sporting event.
Instead, Dan Patrick and Liam McHugh will co-host the pregame show alongside analysts Tony Dungy, Rodney Harrison, Mike Florio and Chris Simms.
NBC says it is NOT using Bob Costas and instead using Liam McHugh as its other host on Super Bowl (besides deserving Dan Patrick) because McHugh worked NFL this season & Costas didn't.
Regardless, NBC will air two of the world’s biggest sporting events next month, the Super Bowl and the Olympics, and Costas won’t be a part of either.
