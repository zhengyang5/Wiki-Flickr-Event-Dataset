It was huge day of offense in Minnesota with the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles combining for a few Super Bowl records. The 74 total points scored in Philadelphiaâ€™s 41-33 win was one point away from tying the record for most points scored.

The record for points in a Super Bowl was set 23 years ago by the San Francisco 49ers and San Diego Chargers. The Steve Young-led 49ers came out on top with a 49-26 win and the combined 75 points was the only time two teams combined for more than 70 points for more than two decades.

Super Bowls 27 and 37 each finished with 69 points, but the Eagles pushed the Super Bowl 52 total over that and into second place with a touchdown in the final minutes that made the score, 38-33. A field goal shortly thereafter made the score 41-33 for the total of 74.

It was a matchup that produced plenty of offensive records, in general, with just one punt and one turnover all game. In just three quarters, the Eagles and Patriots combined for the most total and most passing yardage in Super Bowl history.

The Eagles became the eighth team to score at least 40 points in a Super Bowl but the first of those eight to give up at least 30.
