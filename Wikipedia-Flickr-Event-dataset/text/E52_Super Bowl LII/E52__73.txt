The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in a thrilling Super Bowl 52, for the first Super Bowl title in franchise history.

The game ended on a Tom Brady hail mary pass that was batted down. Here’s how it looked on the NBC broadcast, with Al Michaels on the call:

And it’s always fun to hear how the home team radio announcers call a team’s title-winning play, especially when it’s a team with a large title drought (the Eagles last won a title in 1960, before the NFL championship game was called the Super Bowl).

Merrill Reese has been the radio voice of the Eagles since 1977, so he’s been waiting 41 years for the chance to call a Philadelphia Super Bowl victory. Here’s his call of the final play on 94.1 WIP-FM, with former Eagles wide receiver Mike Quick joining him as the color commentator:

“Eagles by 8. Brady, lines ’em up, he’s back again, he steps up, he’s hit, he stumbles, he’s throwing it deep for the end zone, and it’s… batted around… and… incomplete! And the game is over! The game is over! The Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl champions! Eagles fans everywhere, this is for you! Let the celebration begin!”

Earlier in the week, Reese told Philly.Com that his potential championship call would be “spontaneous” and “from [his] heart.”
