At Super Bowl XL, the "home designated" Pittsburgh Steelers elected to wear their road whites because that's what they wore for all their victorious playoff games leading up to the game.
For Super Bowl XLVIII this weekend, the "home" Denver Broncos have chosen to wear their home orange jerseys with white pants.
A 23-0 shutout over the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium, the site of Super Bowl XLVIII.
It doesn't just stop there, over the entire history of the Super Bowl the team in white has won 62% of the time - a record of 29 wins and 18 losses in the 47 Super Bowl games played so far.
We'll see if the Broncos can overcome the jersey odds (in Jersey, no less), and end that wild streak of white winners in the Super Bowl.
