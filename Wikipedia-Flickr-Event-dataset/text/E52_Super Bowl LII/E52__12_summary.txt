Super Bowl LII will be remembered as one of the best ever.
New England's 33 points were also the most scored in a loss in Super Bowl history.
Let's not leave Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles in the dark.
Foles landed in the top five all-time for most passing yards in a Super Bowl with 373, just four yards shy of Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner in XLIII.
Thanks to the game turning into a shootout early, it also finished one point short of tying the highest-scoring Super Bowl in history.
