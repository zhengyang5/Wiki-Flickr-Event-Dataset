Top seeds See All NewsThe odds of Super Bowl LII featuring the top seed from each conference are a long shot.
That explains why, in 1972, the 14-0 Miami Dolphins had to travel to Pittsburgh for the AFC championship game against the 11-3 Steelers.
The format that year had the AFC Central Division champions hosting the game if they won the divisional playoff one week earlier.
Since home field advantage counted in the post-merger playoffs, 24 of the NFCâ€™s top seeds have reached the Super Bowl.
The 2016 New England Patriots are just the 23rd top seeded AFC team to reach the Super Bowl but only eight were crowned world champions.
