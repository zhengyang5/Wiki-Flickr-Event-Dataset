It was huge day of offense in Minnesota with the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles combining for a few Super Bowl records.
The 74 total points scored in Philadelphiaâ€™s 41-33 win was one point away from tying the record for most points scored.
The record for points in a Super Bowl was set 23 years ago by the San Francisco 49ers and San Diego Chargers.
In just three quarters, the Eagles and Patriots combined for the most total and most passing yardage in Super Bowl history.
The Eagles became the eighth team to score at least 40 points in a Super Bowl but the first of those eight to give up at least 30.
