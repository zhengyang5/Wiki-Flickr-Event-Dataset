The New England Patriots defense was supposed to turn things around in Week 4.
In a 33-30 loss to the Caronlina Panthers, the Patriots let up over 30 points for the third time in four weeks.
Here are some statistics, some X’s and O’s and some quotes that help illustrate the sad state of the Patriots defense after four weeks of NFL action.
The 444 yards allowed were better than their average on the year, as noted by MassLive’s Kevin Duffy.
With 456.8 yards allowed per game, the Patriots are averaging 60 yards more than the 31st-ranked Indianapolis Colts.
