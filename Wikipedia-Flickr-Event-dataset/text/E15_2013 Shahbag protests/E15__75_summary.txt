“Jamaat-e-Islami activists” used the protest call given by the 12 “Islamist” and likeminded parties after Friday prayers to “fight back” as they went berserk in different parts of the country including the capital Dhaka, police say.
Reports of clashes also came in from Chittagong, Sylhet, Rajshahi and other areas, and journalists were injured after the “Islamists” held protest rallies to “punish anti-religious bloggres” and against a call by the Shahbagh demonstrators demanding a ban on Jamaat and capital punishment for convicted war criminals.
A police official in Dhaka said they think the “Islamist” protesters are actually “Jamaat activists” and they “will look into it”.
The ‘Islamists’ clashed with police, hurled bombs and pelted stones in and around the Paltan of Dhaka soon after Friday afternoon prayers, prompting the law enforcers to respond with teargas shells and rubber bullets.
The ‘Islamists’ gathered at the Baitul Mukarram premises and started throwing stones at police at around 12:45pm, said a bdnews24.com correspondent.
