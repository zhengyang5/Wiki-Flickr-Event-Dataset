A silence stronger than wordsPeople spontaneously express solidarity with Shahbagh protesters by standing up for 3-minute silence at a street in front of Secretariat in the capital Tuesday afternoon.
People in their thousands streamed to the street and stood in silence.
A silence stronger than the high-temper steel.
A silence that cried in the loudest of voices: We want just trial of the war criminals.
Passengers in buses left their seats and stood in silence.
