Protesters continue to demand death penalty for Bangladesh war criminal Abdul Quader MollahDhaka , Fri, 08 Feb 2013 ANIDhaka, Feb.8 (ANI): The sentencing of Abdul Quader Mollah, an Islamist cleric, to life in prison for crimes against humanity in the nation's 1971 war of independence, has evoked angry protests in Dhaka and in other parts of Bangladesh.
Thousands of people have joined the protest demanding death sentence for Abdul Quader Mollah and for every warcriminal.
We cannot accept their lifetime imprisonment," CNN quoted Shoaib, a student of Dhaka University, as saying earlier this week.
He added: "We will not leave until Quader Mollah is sentenced to death."
"If a murder's verdict is death sentence, then how can a person involved in over 300 murders can be sentenced to lifetime imprisonment instead of death sentence," asked another student.
