A wave of violent attacks against Bangladesh’s minority Hindu community shows the urgent need for authorities to provide them with better protection, Amnesty International said.
Scores of shops and houses belonging to the Hindu community have also been burned down, leaving hundreds of people homeless.
“The Hindu community in Bangladesh is at extreme risk, in particular at such a tense time in the country.
“Given the obvious risks the Hindu minority faces in Bangladesh, these attacks were sadly predictable.
“While there are credible reports that police firing may have followed violent attacks against them by protesters, police use of excessive force cannot be discounted”, Faiz said.
