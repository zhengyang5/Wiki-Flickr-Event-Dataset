Hefazate Islam Bangladesh, like any other non-political social and cultural organisation, claims to be a peopleâ€™s platform to articulate the concerns of religious issues.
Speeches by the Hefazate Islam leaders continued beyond sunset, but eventually stopped at around 8:00 pm right before the Esha prayers.
Hefazate Islam leaders used the megaphones to request members of the law enforcement agencies not to open fire.
Saidul Bari (17) was killed by pro Awami League activists when he went to join the Hefazate Islam movement.
A Hefazate Islam member (who wishes to be anonymous) stated that he was informed of 202 deaths and around 2500 persons missing.
