Through advertisements, reports in certain newspapers and rallies, efforts were being made to confuse people about the motive of the young organisers by tweaking religious sentiment of the people, alleged law enforcers and bloggers yesterday.
It claimed that the Shahbagh movement was against Islam.
Using such advertisements and reports in like-minded newspapers, the anti-liberation forces held protest rallies in Dhaka and Chittagong yesterday to counter the Shahbagh movement.
In a statement in the afternoon, Jamaat-e-Islami said, â€œThe main objective of the Shahbagh protesters is to root out Islam from the country.
He said the Shahbagh protesters have nothing against any religion, as the movement is against the mass murderers of 1971.
