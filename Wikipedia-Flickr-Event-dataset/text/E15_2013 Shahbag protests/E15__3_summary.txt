Calling for a ban on the politics of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir, the demonstrators pledged to boycott all business and social organisations, including media outlets, of the party.
The protesters were reminded that Jamaat-Shibir uses the money earned from these business establishments in subversive activities in the country.
Thousands of people put up their right arm and recited the oath after Imran who organised the rally of 'Bloggers and Online Activist Network' from day one.
