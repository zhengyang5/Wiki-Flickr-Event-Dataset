Tens of thousands of people at Shahbagh grand rally took an oath Friday afternoon to carry on their movement demanding death penalty for all war criminals including Abdul Quader Mollah.

Calling for a ban on the politics of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir, the demonstrators pledged to boycott all business and social organisations, including media outlets, of the party.

Imran, a lead organiser of the demonstration that began shortly after Jamaat leader Mollah was sentenced to life in prison for war crimes on Tuesday, administered the oath to thousands of people, mostly youths.

People from all walks of life including women took the oath to remain on the streets until the government bans Jamaat-Shibir politics and put a ban on their business establishments -- Islami Bank, IBN Sina, several coaching centres including Focus and Retina, media outlets including Diganta Television and the daily Nayadiganta -- scrapping citizenship of their activists.

The protesters were reminded that Jamaat-Shibir uses the money earned from these business establishments in subversive activities in the country.

They also vowed to help the ongoing war crimes tribunal.

The demonstrators pledged to mount pressure on the government to arrest Jamaat-Shibir leaders and activists for committing sedition by threatening to wage a civil war in the country.

Thousands of people put up their right arm and recited the oath after Imran who organised the rally of 'Bloggers and Online Activist Network' from day one.
