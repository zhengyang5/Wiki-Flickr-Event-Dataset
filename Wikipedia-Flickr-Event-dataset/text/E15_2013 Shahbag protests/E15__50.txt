They formed a human chain in front of the Cologne Dome on Saturday, expressing solidarity with the protesters back home who are also calling for a ban on Jamaat-e-Islami.



This is the latest in a series of demonstrations taking place in different countries across the globe as an expression of solidarity with the Shahbag protesters. Non-resident Bangladeshis in the US, UK, Australia, Switzerland, Sweden and India have already extended their support for the protesters in Bangladesh.



The Blogger and Online Activist Network had begun the movement at Shahbagh on Feb 5 rejecting the International Crimes Tribunal-2 verdict which sentenced Jamaat Assistant Secretary General Abdul Quader Molla to life imprisonment for his crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War.



The movement stepped into day 12 on Saturday as it spread across the country like blazing fire demanding death sentence for all war criminals. The protesters are also demanding ban of Jamaatâ€™s politics.
