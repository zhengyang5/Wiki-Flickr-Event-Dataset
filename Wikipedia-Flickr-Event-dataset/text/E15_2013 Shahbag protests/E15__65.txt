The news is fresh and details are only emerging about the murder of Ahmed Rajib Haider Shuvo, a blogger involved in the Shahbag protest. In today’s world we can view immediately online the outcry this provokes. Last week I wrote about the online echo on Twitter the Shahbag protest had. This time I am taking a snapshot of Twitter just after the news of the murder broke to illustrate how quickly such an event spreads.

#Shabag remains a domestic topic, 15:30 Dhaka time (16/02/2013)

#Shahbag, despite more international media coverage, stays a local topic. It is predominant in Bangladesh and has some resonance in Great Britain, probably due to the large Bangladeshi community there. In Bangladesh the most active topics are #Shahbag and related messages.
