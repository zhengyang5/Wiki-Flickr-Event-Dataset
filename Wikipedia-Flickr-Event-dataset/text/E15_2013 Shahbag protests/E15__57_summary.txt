DHAKA (Reuters) - About 100,000 people rallied in Bangladesh’s capital on Friday to vent their anger at the country’s feuding politicians, the fourth day of protests after an Islamist leader convicted of war crimes was spared execution.
REUTERS/Andrew BirajProtesters enraged by Mollah’s verdict have increasingly turned their anger towards the country’s main political parties, because they waited four decades to bring war criminals to trial and are feuding over the validity of the war crimes tribunal.
In a sign of the growing resentment towards politicians, the protesters refused to allow political leaders to speak at the rally.
“They let this cause down.”“Politicians have been busy slinging mud against each other and spent decades without pushing the war crimes issue.
Eight other top Jamaat leaders and two from the BNP are on trial for war crimes.
