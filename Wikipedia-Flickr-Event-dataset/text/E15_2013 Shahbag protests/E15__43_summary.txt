The Jamaat-e-Islami called a dawn-to-dusk hartal in Chittagong division for tomorrow after party leaders were denied permission for holding a rally in the port city yesterday.
The protest programme was declared at a press briefing at the office of city unit Islami Chhatra Shibir, student wing of Jamaat, at West Bakalia.
Jamaat city unit Ameer Shamsul Islam, MP, made the announcement, according to a press release.
But the Chittagong Metropolitan Police had not given them permission, Jamaat city unit Publicity Secretary Mohammad Ullah told The Daily Star.
Four people, including two pedestrians, were killed in clashes during the hartal enforced by Jamaat, said police sources, but Jamaat claims all of them belonged to the party.
