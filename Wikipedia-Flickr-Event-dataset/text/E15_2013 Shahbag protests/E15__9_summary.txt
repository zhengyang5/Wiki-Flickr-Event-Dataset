A controversial tribunal in Bangladesh has been investigating war crimes committed during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.
In 1973, the government cancelled his citizenship for allegedly co-operating with Pakistani forces during the independence war.
He was sentenced to death for war crimes in October 2014.
At his trial, Mir Quasem Ali was accused of involvement in a "reign of terror" in the city of Chittagong.
Kamaruzzaman was found guilty on five out of seven charges of crimes against humanity, including the murder and torture of unarmed civilians.
