Sayedee was brought to the dock around 11:10am and the tribunal judges started reading out the 56-page summery of the verdict after an introduction in which it was said that the Sayedee of 1971 was being tried, not the MP Sayedee or the Sayedee known for his religious sermons or the political leader Sayedee.
Mofizuddin Posari, who was also captured by the Pakistani army and Razakars along with Kutti, testified against Sayedee.
He said Sayedee as a member of the Razakar force captured them and ultimately the Pakistani army killed Kutti.
With the assistance of Sayedee, the Pakistani army attacked the Hindu-dominated neighbourhood of Umedpur village and looted valuables from homes.
Being the leader of the team, Sayedee failed to prevent them from committing rape.
