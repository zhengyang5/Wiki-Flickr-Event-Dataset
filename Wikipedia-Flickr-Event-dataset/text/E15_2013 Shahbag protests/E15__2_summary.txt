People from different walks of life took to the streets of Dhaka ever since Jamaat’s Assistant secretary General Abdul Quader Molla was awarded life term by the ICT-2 for his involvement in war crimes.
The protestors also joined the Convenor of the Blogger and Online Activist Network, Imran H Sarkar, who presided over Friday’s rally, in demanding that the Bangladeshi citizenship of the Jamaat leaders be revoked.
The first verdict delivered by the ICT against Abul Kalam Azad alias ‘Bachchu Razakar’ on Jan 21, underlined Jamaat’s role in carrying out war crimes.
The tribunal’s second verdict provided a more vivid account of the Islamist party’s complicity with the Pakistani forces in 1971.
ICT’s first verdict described as to how the party set up “armed forces” to “save Pakistan”, and in the process helped the Pakistani forces against “unarmed Bengalis”.
