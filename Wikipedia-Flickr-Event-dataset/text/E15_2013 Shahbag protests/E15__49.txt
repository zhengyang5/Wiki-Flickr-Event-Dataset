For the last few days the young generation of Bangladesh as well as the general people have been protesting against the war criminals of 1971 at Shahbag. We highly appreciate them and agree with them. We want proper justice for war criminals. As we are now abroad, we can't involve ourselves directly with the protest. On 15th February, we arranged a get-together to protest against the war criminals and to support the Shahbag movement from Sydney in the Sydney University campus under the banner of Bangladeshi Students Association.
