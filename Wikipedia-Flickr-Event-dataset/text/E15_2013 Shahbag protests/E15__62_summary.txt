The movement – centred around Shahbag, which some have renamed Projonmo Chottor (New Generation Roundabout) – shows no sign of abating.
The world quickly forgot the Bangladesh war.
The campaign included a promise to set up a tribunal to prosecute those who had committed war crimes in 1971.
With the chanting and singing spreading across the grounds, the protesters of Shahbag often resemble a jubilant flash-mob.
The next few weeks will be crucial for the Shahbag movement.
