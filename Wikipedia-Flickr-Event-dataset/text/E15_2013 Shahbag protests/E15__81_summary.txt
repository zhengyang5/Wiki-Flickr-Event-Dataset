They vowed to hoist the national flag in educational institutions and homes across the country to free the nation from the ‘stigma’ attached to war crimes.
School students, freedom fighters and other professionals held candlelight vigil expressing solidarity with the Shahbagh protests.
Even rickshaw pullers from surrounding areas showed their support for the protest as they carried many passengers to Shahbagh during mass rallies.
But the protesters are still on the streets and have renewed their pledge to continue with the movement until the last war criminal is executed.
The protesters staged flag rallies at capital’s 'Rayerbazar Mass Killing Ground' and five other places in support of their demand.
