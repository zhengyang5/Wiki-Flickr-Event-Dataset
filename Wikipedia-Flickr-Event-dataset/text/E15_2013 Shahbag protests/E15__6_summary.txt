Fuelled by the overwhelming support of the masses – especially the youth – demonstrators are now also demanding a ban on Jamaat.
Law Minister Shafique Ahmed has also confirmed that the government is considering banning Jamaat.
“We are scrutinizing the legal grounds to ban Jamaat politics,” he adds.
Instead of depending on the court, a decision has to be made politically to ban Jamaat, he insists.
By and large, analysts believe that the decision to ban Jamaat is simply a matter of time now.
