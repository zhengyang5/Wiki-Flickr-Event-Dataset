Protests and strikes, common in Dhaka, are often coordinated and organized by political parties.
But the Shahbagh protests, as the demonstrations over the verdict have come to be known, were organized by bloggers and have attracted poets, artists, social activists and untold numbers of other citizens.
Political analysts in Bangladesh say the youth demonstrations reflect broad public disenchantment with the usual style of Bangladeshi politics.
Before its verdict on Feb. 5, Jamaat and other opposition parties staged huge protests against the tribunalâ€™s proceedings; they sought to renew those protests on Tuesday, but the government denied their request.
Bangladeshi news media reported that at least 10 people were injured by the rubber bullets, and that members of the Jamaat youth wing were seen firing weapons and throwing fire bombs.
