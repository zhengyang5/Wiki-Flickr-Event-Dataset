DHAKA, BANGLADESH—Hundreds of thousands of people rallied Friday in Bangladesh’s capital to demand executions for people convicted of war crimes involving the nation’s independence war in 1971.
Hours after Tuesday’s verdict by an International Crimes Tribunal, protesters burst into the street, denouncing the verdict.
Hasina’s government initiated a process in 2010 of trying those accused of committing crimes against humanity during the war.
Jamaat campaigned against Bangladesh’s independence war and stands accused of forming several groups to help Pakistani troops in killing, rape and arson.
Zia has called the tribunal a farce, while Hasina has urged Zia to stop backing those she says fought against independence.
