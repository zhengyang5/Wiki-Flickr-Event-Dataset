Parliament yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling on the government to ensure immediate trial of the war criminals.
“Measures be taken immediately to try the war criminals,” reads the resolution adopted amid thunderous desk-thumping.
“The war criminals will for sure be tried on the soil of Bangla,” he added.
Planning Minister AK Khandaker, who was the deputy commander-in-chief of the Liberation War forces, thanked parliament for adopting the resolution.
As the state minister for liberation war affairs rose to reply to the proposed resolution, the lawmakers chorused aloud that the prime minister should speak on such an important matter.
