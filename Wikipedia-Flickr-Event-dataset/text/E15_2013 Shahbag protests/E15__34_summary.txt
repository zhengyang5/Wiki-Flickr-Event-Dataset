After Jamaat executive council member Delwar Hossain Sayedee was awarded death sentence for 1971 war crimes, the attacks there were carried out from a Jamaat procession protesting the verdict.
Right after the verdict, leaders and activists of Jamaat and its student affiliate Islami Chhatra Shibir took out the procession at Begumganjâ€™s Rajganj Bazar.
Meanwhile, activists of Jamaat supporters clashed with police in Noakhali town following the verdict.
Shibir activists detonated several crude bombs at that time.
Acting SP Mahbub Rashid said the Shibir men also vandalised 12 buses and torched four more at the Al-Amin Bus Depot at Dattar Haat.
