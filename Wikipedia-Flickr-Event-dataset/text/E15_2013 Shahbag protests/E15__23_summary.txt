Dhaka: Tens of thousands of Bangladeshi youngsters on Friday staged a nationwide protest demanding death penalty to 1971 war criminals and a ban on fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) party as their mass sit-in continued for the fourth consecutive day in the national capital.
The protesters shouted slogans like `Made in Pakistan - Jamaat-e-Islam; Go back to Pakistan`, `The evil souls; the coffin awaits bodies of hanged razakars` and `Joy Bangla`.
A large number of police personnel were deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incident.
The police blocked nearby streets and diverted traffic near the areas surrounding Shahbag Avenue, the centre of protests and sit-in.
The crowd sang patriotic songs, beat drums and burned effigies of the leaders of JI, which opposed Bangladesh`s 1971 independence from Pakistan and carried out atrocities siding with Pakistani troops.
