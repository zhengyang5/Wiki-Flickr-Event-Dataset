DHAKA - Much of Bangladesh fell silent for three minutes on Tuesday as part of a growing mass public campaign to demand the execution of defendants who are being tried for war crimes by a domestic tribunal.
Tens of thousands of people stood in silence at one key intersection in central Dhaka, where protesters have been staging demonstrations for the last eight days demanding that war criminals be hanged.
Play in the Bangladesh Premier League was halted as cricketers expressed their solidarity with the protesters.
People of every segment, profession and party joined the protest to demand quick execution of the war criminals," said Imran Sarker, an organiser, told AFP.
Eight other Jamaat officials, including its head and deputy head and two senior officials of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), are also being tried by the tribunal.
