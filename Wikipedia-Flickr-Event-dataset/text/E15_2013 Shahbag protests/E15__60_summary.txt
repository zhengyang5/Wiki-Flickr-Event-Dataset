Some war criminals fled abroad.
As long ago as 1995, the British authorities had their attention brought to alleged war criminals living in London by a Channel 4 documentary directed by the Dhaka journalist David Bergman.
Hence the call for the death penalty, as the one punishment that no politician can reverse.
Serious doubts have been raised about aspects of the trials, and the death penalty cannot be the right solution.
That might permit, too, the trial of the main war criminals, and not just their Bangladeshi collaborators.
