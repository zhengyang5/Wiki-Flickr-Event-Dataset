The young in Dhaka have revolted over the war crimes trials of members of Jamaat-e-Islami.
The outcome of a belated trial of handful of Jamaat war criminals has set Bangladesh on fire.
On the other, the demonstrators are saying with equal force that they want the death penalty, that most anti-liberal of punishments, applied to the war criminals without mercy.
In the case of British Islam, the anointed group was Jamaat-e-Islami, even though its British members included men accused of war crimes in Bangladesh.
Whitehall has been as keen on dealing with the allies of war criminals.
