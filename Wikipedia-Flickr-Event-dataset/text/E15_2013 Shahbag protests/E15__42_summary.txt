The cabinet yesterday approved proposed amendments to the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act to introduce a provision for plaintiffs to appeal to the apex court against verdicts delivered by the tribunals.
The stipulated time for filing an appeal with the Supreme Court is 30 days from verdict delivery.
The â€œlenientâ€ sentencing of Quader Mollah sparked the movement.
He said there was no provision for victims or the government to appeal against any sentence handed down by the tribunals, other than an acquittal.
The window to file the appeal is 30 days from the day of the verdict delivery by a tribunal.
