more-inProtesters vowed to avenge the killing of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haidar, one of the key participants of the massive Shahbagh movement, as they continued their demonstration for the 12th consecutive day on Saturday.
Rajib, a young architect and activist of the Shahbagh protest, was stabbed to dead near his house in Dhaka on Friday night allegedly by Jamaat militants.
This prompted the protesters to go back to their 24-hour movement instead of seven-hour programme which they had declared hours before the death.
They also sang gono shongeet (mass song) in unison at Shahbagh where namaz-e-janaza of Rajib was held in the afternoon.
The Shahbagh protesters have been demanded immediate arrest of the killers and ban pro-Jamaat blog Sonarbangla.
