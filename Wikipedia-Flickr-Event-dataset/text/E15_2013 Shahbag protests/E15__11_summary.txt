Earlier the day, the protesters announced seven-hour protest rallies every day from Friday’s ‘Jagaran Samabesh’, or the Uprising Rally.
However, several organisations campaigning for execution of war crimes perpetrators rejected the seven-hour protest plan saying it was a ‘betrayal’ of the spirit of the movement.
Around 10pm, a procession by youths circled Shahbagh and the surrounding areas chanting slogans that urged everyone to continue demonstration until Jamaat was banned from politics.
Meanwhile, around 100 students studying in Sweden’s Lund University and Malmo University paraded the streets expressing solidarity with the Shahbagh movement.
They took out a nearly two-and a-half-hour long procession around 3pm local time in the Malmö city braving freezing cold.
