Jamaat-e-Islami called a two-day strike across the country, beginning on Sunday, in protest at the court ruling.
Some believe that as Jamaat is fighting for its survival it is bound to intensify its protests.
I visited a few villages near Chittagong where the situation is tense and Jamaat supporters are angry with the ruling Awami League party.
The tribunal is trying a total of nine Jamaat leaders and two members of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
With Jamaat threatening more protests, there are increasing concerns over political stability in the country, our correspondent says.
