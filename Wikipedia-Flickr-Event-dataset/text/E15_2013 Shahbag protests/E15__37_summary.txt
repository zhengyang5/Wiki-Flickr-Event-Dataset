In a Mar 6 report, titled ‘Bangladesh: Wave of Violent Attacks Against Hindu Minority’, the Amnesty said as many as 40 Hindu temples were vandalised in attacks by supporters of an Islamic party.
The report gave Bangladesh's war crimes trial as the context to the violence against the Hindus.
The report said attacks on Hindus and other minorities were often reported from Bangladesh, especially from the far-flung areas.
According to the Amnesty, Bangladesh’s Hindu minority constitutes only eight per cent of the population and has historically been at risk of violence.
“While there are credible reports that police firing may have followed violent attacks against them by protesters, use of excessive force by police cannot be discounted,” Faiz said.
