At long last, Zimbabwe will have its first Winter Olympian to cheer for next month in Sochi.
Luke Steyn is set to become the African nation's first competitor at a Winter Games, as the alpine ski racer is scheduled to compete in slalom and giant slalom.
However, Zimbabwe isn't the only country that will be making its first-ever appearance at a Winter Olympics this year.
Togo has also never been to a Winter Games, but could be sending two athletes this year â€” cross-country skier Mathilde-Amivi Petitjean and slalom skier Alessia Afi Dipol.
That includes Ghana, as "The Snow Leopard" Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, a slalom skier who endeared himself to Sea to Sky residents during the last Winter Olympics, won't be back.
