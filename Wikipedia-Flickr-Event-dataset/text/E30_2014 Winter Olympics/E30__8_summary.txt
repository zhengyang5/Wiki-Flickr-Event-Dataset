For almost seven years, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak focused on making sure Russia was prepared to host one of the country's biggest events in decades, the $51 billion Sochi Winter Olympics.
Alexei Makarkin, a deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, said Kozak will have to oversee the construction of infrastructure and power and natural gas supply networks in Crimea.
In 2004, Putin supposedly wanted to appoint him prime minister but did not because many of Putin's allies objected, Belkovsky said.
Instead, he joined the Cabinet as a deputy prime minister under Putin starting in 2008, a position he continues to hold now under Medvedev.
Makarkin said the high-profile projects entrusted to Kozak demonstrated his position simply as a devoted member of Putin's team.
