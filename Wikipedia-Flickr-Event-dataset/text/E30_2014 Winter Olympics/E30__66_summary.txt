KRASNODAR, July 19 (RIA Novosti) - About 300 Cossack volunteers will help enforce law and order during the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, a regional official said Friday.
Krasnodar Territory, where Sochi is located, was the first to set up official Cossack squads last September.
About 1,300 Cossacks currently help law enforcement.
Cossack squads patrol streets and public places in traditional uniforms together with police; they may check IDs and take suspects to police stations.
