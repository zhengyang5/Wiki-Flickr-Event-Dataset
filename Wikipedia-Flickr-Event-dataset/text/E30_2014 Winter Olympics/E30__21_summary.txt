Russian organizers describe the motto as reflecting the national character, but its meaning may have been lost in translation.
A singing group from Siberia performs during a welcome ceremony for the German Olympic team at the Olympic Village in Krasnaya Polyana.
Each time the Olympic Games roll around, an organizing committee is tasked with distilling the unique character of the event into a punchy slogan.
Sochi organizers helpfully provided an official explanation of the slogan, describing it as “intended to reflect the national character of Russia and the values of the Sochi 2014 brand, as well as Sochi 2014’s progressive and innovative approach to the organization and staging of the Games.”And the periods between the words?
As Mr. Chernyshenko explained, “The Sochi 2014 slogan demonstrates that it is impossible not to participate, watch, experience, and be proud because this is Your Games."
