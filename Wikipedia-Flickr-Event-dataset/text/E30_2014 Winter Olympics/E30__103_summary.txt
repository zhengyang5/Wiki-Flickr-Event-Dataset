SUBSCRIBERussian President Vladimir Putin suggested Thursday that the United States is trying to interfere in Russia's presidential elections through punishments meted out against its Olympic athletes, according to a state news agency.
The World Anti-Doping Agency last year accused Russia of running a state-sponsored doping system from 2011 to 2015.
The International Olympic Committee, or IOC, on Thursday announced sanctions against four Russian athletes related to the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, saying they committed anti-doping rule violations.
The IOC announced sanctions against two other Russian athletes for doping violations from the 2014 Sochi games on Nov. 1.
