The Russian Soyuz TMA-09M spacecraft undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) at 11:26pm UTC, ahead of a safe return to Earth early on Monday (local time).
In preparation for their trip home, the Soyuz TMA-09M crew donned their Sokol launch and entry suits, closed the hatch between the Orbital Module (BO) and Descent Module (SA), and strapped themselves into their Kazbek couches inside the SA.
The return of the crew will mark the immediate conclusion to a very busy few days for the ISS.
The torch is onboard the Soyuz TMA-09M for its return to Earth where it will eventually be used to light the Olympic flame at the games.
ISS Status:In the run-up to the arrival of the latest three crewmembers, the Soyuz TMA-09M was relocated from the ISS Mini-Research Module (MRM)-1 and docked to the Service Module (SM) Aft port.
