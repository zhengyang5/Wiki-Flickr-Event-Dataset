This states that since the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) is suspended, Russian athletes can participate in PyeongChang only on invitation of the IOC.
A comprehensive longitudinal blood testing programme was introduced by FIS in 2001 with the blood values simultaneously provided to WADA for independent monitoring and scrutiny.
Prior to the WADA ABP when a urine test was required to determine blood doping, the blood values from the FIS blood testing programme have been analysed by appointed anti-doping experts.
There have been two FIS Anti-Doping Experts since the inception of the professionally managed programme: the late Professor Bengt Saltin from 2001-2006 who handed over to Dr Rasmus Damsgaard in 2006.
There have been several official presentations at medical symposiums and publications in scientific journals based on the blood data collected from 2001-2006.
