With the Winter Games drawing to a close Sunday, the network’s presentation seems to have been a solid hit with viewers.
NBC’s decision to show recorded events in prime time — its usual practice with games in distant time zones — elicited some grumbling.
But NBC, which paid $775 million to the International Olympic Committee for the U.S. rights to the Games, has largely steered clear of controversy by avoiding potentially touchy subjects.
NBC Sports spokesman Greg Hughes defended the network’s presentation, noting that it devoted time in its first two prime-time shows to non-athletic subjects.
The Olympics, she added, “are always kind of overblown, overpriced, and overrated events.”
