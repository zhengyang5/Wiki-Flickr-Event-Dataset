LAS VEGAS -- Comcast chief technology officer Tony Werner revealed that the company will record portions of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games from Sochi in Ultra HD.
To that end, we will be doing some stuff to stimulate the imagination with the Winter Olympics.
Comcast is to integrate an app into new Samsung Ultra HD TVs for on-demand streaming of 4K content direct to the sets.
Cookson said another issue holding back content creators was the amount of data 4K productions require.
Cookson emphasized the need to talk about Ultra HD as a package of elements and not focus strictly on resolution.
