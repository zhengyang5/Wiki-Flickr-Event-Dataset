2. Re: National Olympic Houses

I worked at the Vancouver USA House as a volunteer, and it is my understanding that the USA Houses are not open to the public, but only to sponsors, bigger donors, invited guests, athlete's families (they each get some passes), medal winners get a party there, certain media members. The shop was in fact not open to the public, but only to members of the Olympic 'family', which could mean members of other Olympic committees, more media people, etc. The definition of Olympic 'family' was broader than the access allowed to the House itself and was controlled by the staff working the front door. Friends of the volunteers were also allowed into the store, and we each got a couple of passes to use on nights we weren't working.

The reason for this, as I understood it at the time, is that the USOC is not funded by the US government, but by sponsors and donors. Therefore it is not open to the general public but is for the use of those people. As to the shop, they cannot compete with apparel licensed by the IOC and for sale at the local shops, therefore the store cannot be open to the general public.

At least that is how it was in Vancouver, and while I am not heading over to Sochi I would assume that things are probably pretty much the same.
