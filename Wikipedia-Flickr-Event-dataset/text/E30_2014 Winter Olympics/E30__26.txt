Next Mario & Sonic has franchise's 1st support for Wii Remote Plus, GamePad

Nintendo President Satoru Iwata announced during Friday's live-streamed Nintendo Direct presentation that Sega will release Mario & Sonic at the Sochi Winter Oympic Games exclusively on the Nintendo Wii U system. The latest game in the Mario & Sonic franchise takes place in Sochi, Russia, the home of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.

The game adds new events including pairs figure skating, and other events were optimized for the Wii U touch screen controls, such as curling and the biathlon. It will be the first to support the Wii Remote Plus as well as the Wii U GamePad. (The last game, Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games , did not have Wii MotionPlus support.) The game is the fourth Mario & Sonic Olympics title; Sega released the first game for the Wii and Nintendo DS in 2007 and 2008.

Nintendo announced the tentatively titled Sonic: Lost World game during the same presentation. Jurgen Post, COO of Sega Europe, then confirmed with GamesIndustry International that there is a third new Sonic game that will be exclusive to Nintendo. Post said, "Sega have chosen to exclusively partner with Nintendo to distribute or publish the next three Sonic the Hedgehog titles throughout Europe and Australia."
