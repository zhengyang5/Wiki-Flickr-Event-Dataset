When Russia was awarded the Sochi Olympics back in 2007, there were celebrations as the country secured its first major sporting event since 1991.
The Sochi Olympics became his personal pet project.
At a conference in September 2010, a presentation ordered by the FSB was given on security in Sochi.
In June, Rostelecom, Russia's national telecom operator, launched a 4G LTE network around Sochi, pledging the fastest Wi-Fi networks in Olympic history, free of charge.
â€¢ All protests, rallies and demonstrations have been banned in Sochi for a 10-week period before and during the Games.
