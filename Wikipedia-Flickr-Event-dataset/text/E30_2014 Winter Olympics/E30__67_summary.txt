President Obama offered Russian President Vladimir Putin the full security assistance of the U.S. Tuesday as concerns continue to mount over terror threats at next month’s Olympic Games.
The White House said Obama, in a phone call, offered to help with security during next month’s games.
The Times reported Dempsey told Russian chief of the general staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov the Defense Department would need to make sure the technology was compatible with Russian security systems before it could be implemented.
Although the FBI has a handful of agents on the ground in Sochi, Russia is in complete control of the security effort.
But as for any further help on the ground, Moscow would have to ask for assistance before the U.S. could take action.
