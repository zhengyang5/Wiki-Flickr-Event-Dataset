Russia's dismal showing at the Vancouver Olympics may be the least of the Kremlin's worries as allegations of corruption mar preparations for the 2014 Sochi Olympics.
A tribute to the 2014 Sochi Olympics is unveiled Sunday during the closing ceremony of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics.
By comparison, the Russian winter athletes at Turin in 2006 brought home 22 medals, including eight golds.
"Sochi is the warmest place in Russia, with no infrastructure, no experience in winter sports – it doesn't even have a hockey team – and many other problems," he says.
He's very proud that he brought the Winter Games home for Sochi, and this will be the enduring legacy of himself and his presidency," says Nemtsov.
