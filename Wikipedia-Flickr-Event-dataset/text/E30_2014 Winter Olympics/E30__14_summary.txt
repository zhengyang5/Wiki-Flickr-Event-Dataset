At the center of the Sochi games Medals Plaza, the "The Waters of the Olympic Park" fountain forms a backdrop for the medals awards and is part of the opening and closing ceremonies.
Created by California design firm WET, the fountain features a basin that measures 75.3 meters (247 feet) in diameter and holds about 700,000 gallons (2.65 million L) of water.
For its other displays, the Sochi fountain uses an array of patented nozzles and jet systems to animate choreographed combinations of water, fog and lights set to music.
Coordinated and multi-colored columns of water, produced by more than 250 nozzles and over a thousand lights, sweep, jump and dance.
WET also has previous Olympics experience, having designed the cauldron for the 2002 games in Salt Lake City.
