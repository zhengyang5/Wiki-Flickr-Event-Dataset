MOSCOW, December 6 (R-Sport) - Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has been given powers to veto any plans for protests in the Winter Olympic host city of Sochi.
They could be used to bar protests over Russia’s controversial law against “gay propaganda”, which has already provoked widespread international criticism.
Restrictions on movement in and around Sochi will be introduced from January 7 through March 21, with “controlled” and “forbidden” zones.
The controlled zones cover all Olympic venues and infrastructure, including the coastal Olympic Park and the mountain cluster of skiing facilities, as well as all transport hubs.
At last year’s London Olympics, protests were restricted near venues but a number of demonstrations took place in other parts of the city during the Games.
