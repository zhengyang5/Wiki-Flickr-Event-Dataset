At its meeting in Kuwait City on 28 November 2006, the IOC Executive Board took the decision not to include Ski Orienteering, Ski Mountaineering and Winter Triathlon – the three recognised sports under consideration – in the review process of the Programme of the 2014 Olympic Winter Games.

IOF President Ake Jacobson commented:

“Although the decision did not come as a complete surprise, we are naturally disappointed. Our vision is to have orienteering included in the programme of both the Olympic Summer and Winter Games. As the IOC has not yet informed us of the reasons behind their decision, it is too early to draw any conclusions. In due time, Council will make a thorough assessment of the situation and consider any possible need for refinements of the key goals and strategic initiatives defined in Strategic Directions 2006 – 2012. The next milestone is 2011, when applications for inclusion in the 2018 Olympic Winter Games will have to be submitted to the IOC.”
