Each of Australia's three free-to-air television networks have pulled out of the race to televise the next Olympic Games.
Nine and Network Ten have declined to make an offer for the rights that would see the successful bidder earn the right to broadcast both the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Olympic officials are now growing increasingly alarmed at the apparent lack of interest from the top television networks.
The Nine Network reportedly lost an estimated $25 million on London 2012.
The $120 million deal for London included Nine forking out $72 million, with Foxtel contributing the other $48 million.
