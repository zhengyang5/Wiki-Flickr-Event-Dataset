Russia will build reserve airports in southern cities of Gelendzhik, Mineralnye Vody and Krasnodar by 2009 to increase passengers turnover for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, the transportation minister said Saturday.

MOSCOW, July 7 (RIA Novosti) - Russia will build reserve airports in southern cities of Gelendzhik, Mineralnye Vody and Krasnodar by 2009 to increase passengers turnover for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, the transportation minister said Saturday.

Igor Levitin said in an interview with Ekho Moskvy radio station that passenger capacity of Moscow airports will be doubled by 2010.

"We have set the task to increase the passenger capacity up to 60 million and Moscow will be able to serve as a transit point for passengers going to the Olympics in Sochi," Levitin said.

The minister also said that all three mooted airports in the south will be connected with each other so that passengers will be able to switch between them without carrying their luggage.

On Wednesday the International Olympic Committee (IOC) chose Sochi, a Russian resort city on the Black Sea, to host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.
