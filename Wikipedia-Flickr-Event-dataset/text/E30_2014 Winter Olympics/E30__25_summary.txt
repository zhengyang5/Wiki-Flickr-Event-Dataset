Zoich the frog, the Internet favorite in the race to become the mascot for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, has been created at the request of the games’ organizing committee.
According to Chernyshenko, Zoich was introduced to the public in order to attract more attention to the mascot vote, especially among Internet users.
On June 14, the organizing committee registered the intellectual property rights on Zoich, as well as on the Snow Leopard, Polar Bear and Hare, who came top in the nationwide vote to become Sochi 2014’s mascot.
The name “Zoich” comes from the way Internet pranksters read the number “2014” on the Sochi Games logo.
Despite its enormous popularity on the web, Zoich wasn’t included in the Top 10 mascot ideas to take part in the nationwide vote back in February.
