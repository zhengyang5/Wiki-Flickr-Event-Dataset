Olympic fury over rules for TV sportAn artist's impression of the 80,000 seat Olympic Stadium which will host the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.
THE International Olympic Committee has slammed Australia's rules for keeping major sports events on free-to-air TV, saying they are choking off competition, and warning that tough new federal laws could inflict commercial damage on valuable TV rights that bankroll the Olympic movement.
"The declaration of all events in the Olympic Games as anti-siphoning events is overboard and excessive," the IOC says.
The significance of this is that such treatment allows events to be broadcast across free-to-air TV, pay TV and content services.
Deals for the Australian TV rights to the 2014 winter games and 2016 summer games have yet to be struck.
