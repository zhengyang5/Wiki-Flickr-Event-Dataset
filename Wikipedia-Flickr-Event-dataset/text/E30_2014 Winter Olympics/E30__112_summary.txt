IOC NewsIOC Statement on CAS decisionThe IOC has taken note of the CAS decision, with satisfaction on the one hand and disappointment on the other.
The CAS required an even higher threshold on the necessary level of evidence than the Oswald Commission and former CAS decisions.
With regard to the participation of athletes from Russia at the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018, the decision of the IOC Executive Board (EB) of 5 December 2017 remains in place.
The result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games.
In this context, it is also important to note that, in his press conference, the CAS Secretary General insisted that the CAS decision “…does not mean that these 28 athletes are declared innocent”.
