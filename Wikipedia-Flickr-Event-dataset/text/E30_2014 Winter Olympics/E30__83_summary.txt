An overwhelming 88 percent of Russians support the gay propaganda ban, according to a survey conducted in June by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center.
“This is not about imposing any kind of sanctions against homosexuality,” Mr. Putin said, defending the propaganda law at a news conference in June.
Russian gay rights advocates said the outrage in the West was providing new energy and financial support to their still relatively young movement.
He also noted that in 1987, Britain adopted a ban on providing information about homosexuality to children nearly identical to the Russian law.
As for gay propaganda, he said the notion was ridiculous.
