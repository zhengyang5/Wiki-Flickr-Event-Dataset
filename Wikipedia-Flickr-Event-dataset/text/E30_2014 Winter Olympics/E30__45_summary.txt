Manali: Four Indian skiers, who have qualified for the Winter Games, will represent the country as independent athletes at the Black Sea resort of Sochi in Russia, Feb 7-23.
"They will not represent the country under the Indian flag, but they are participating as independent athletes under the Olympic flag," Thakur told a leading agency.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspended India in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).
The IOC has asked the IOA to conduct fresh elections at the earliest so that the athletes could take part in the Winter Games under the tri-colour.
But the IOA elections will be held Feb 9, two days after the Sochi Games begin.
