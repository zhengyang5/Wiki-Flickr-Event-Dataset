In preparation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Krasnodar regional government will spend 3 billion rubles ($46 million) removing the roof of a stadium built for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the TASS news agency reported Tuesday.
The Fisht Olympic Stadium, which hosted the Games' opening ceremony, cost about 17.5 billion rubles ($270 million) to build and is already partially open to the air.
Sochi, the venue for last year's Winter Olympics, is one of 11 cities slated to host the FIFA World Cup.
Projects connected to the championship are estimated to cost a total of 664 billion rubles ($10 billion), according to news agency Reuters.
There are concerns that World Cup spending could plow through these estimates, however.
