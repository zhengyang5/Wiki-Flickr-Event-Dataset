"They told us that they needed to pull down our house to build a road for the Olympics," Mr Mzokov recalls.
The family, says Mr Mzokov, were simply "kicked out in the street"; his elderly father dragged out of his home by bailiffs.
Mr Mzokov says that the money the family was promised was embezzled by corrupt local officials in the regional governor's office.
That's around 80 times less than Mr Putin has lavished on the Sochi Olympics.
As for the impending Olympics, Mr Mzokov is trying his best to ignore them.
