The International Olympic Committee (IOC) have backed former Moscow Laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov as a "truthful witness" in their first reasoned decision published following the Sochi 2014 doping scandal.
The case involves cross-country skier Alexander Legkov, one of the first Russian athletes to be sanctioned.
Evidence provided by Rodchenkov was also used in the case, leading to the Commission being "comfortably satisfied" Legkov was a beneficiary of a cover-up scheme.
"These findings were not only based on the witness evidence provided by Dr Rodchenkov.
The backing offered by the Commission to the evidence provided by Rodchenkov and McLaren is set to be significant other cases involving Russian athletes.
