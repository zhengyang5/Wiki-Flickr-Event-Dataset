Sustainability is one of the three pillars of Olympic Agenda 2020 alongside credibility and youth.
In line with its recommendations, the IOC has developed a Sustainability Strategy.
This is why sustainability, together with credibility and youth, is one of the three key pillars of Olympic Agenda 2020, the strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement.
Olympic Agenda 2020 places great emphasis on incorporating sustainability in all aspects of the Olympic Games and encourages all stakeholders of the Olympic Movement to include sustainability in their daily operations.
"The IOC Sustainability Strategy will fundamentally shape the working practices of the IOC, the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement."
