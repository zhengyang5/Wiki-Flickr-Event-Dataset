KRASNODAR, Russia, October 30 (R-Sport) - Police at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics will be able to converse with spectators and other guests in three languages: English, French and German, the Russian Interior Ministry said Wednesday.

More than 40,000 law enforcement officials will be deployed in securing Russia's first Olympics, which run February 7-23, and many of them will be versed in the basics of those languages after going through intensive training courses, the ministry said in a statement.

Should the cops find themselves tongue-tied, they will be able to call a 24-hour hotline where multi-lingual volunteers will be on hand to convey what they want to say, the ministry said. Phrasebooks have also been distributed as a fallback option.
