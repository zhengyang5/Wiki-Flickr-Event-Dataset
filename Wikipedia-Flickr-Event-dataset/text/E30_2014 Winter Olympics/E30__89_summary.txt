North Jersey Circassians 'in exile' launch Olympic protestSTAFF WRITERThe RecordCircassians in North Jersey are headed for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver with a message to the world: If you let the 2014 games go on as planned in Russia, you’ll be skiing on the graves of our oppressed ancestors.
On Wednesday, 10 members of the institute plan to leave for the Vancouver Olympics to call attention to their history.
They are going to join members of a Circassian community from California in protest at Russian Olympic event venues while the world has its eyes turned on the games.
Fast facts North Jersey’s about 5,000 Circassians, mostly residing in the Passaic County, make up the largest such community in the United States.
And they fear if the Sochi Olympics go forward, Russia will have legitimized its claim on the region, leaving the Circassians forgotten.
