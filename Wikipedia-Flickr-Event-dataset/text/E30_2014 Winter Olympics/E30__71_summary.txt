The International Olympic Committee has moved to calm fears that athletes would be “blown up” by terrorists at the Winter Games after several countries, including Britain, received emails and letters threatening their safety.
The German, Italian, Hungarian, Slovenian and Slovakian Olympic associations all confirmed that they had received the malicious communication written in both English and Russian and warning them against travelling to Sochi.
Zsigmond Nagy, director of international relations at the Hungarian Olympic Committee, claimed that the letter received by his country said “persons attending the Olympic Games might be blown up”.
Head of department Walter Palmer said: “Here you have, from our point of view, a transfer of really sensitive whereabouts data to a country where that could pose a real security threat.
In Sochi, which plans to host hundreds of thousands of visitors during the Games, security forces are searching for a woman called Ruzanna Ibragimova, 23, who they suspect may be planning a suicide attack.
