International Olympic Committee (IOC) Disciplinary Committee proceedings have today been dropped against Russia's Sochi 2014 figure skating champion Adelina Sotnikova.
"Whereas the IOC Disciplinary Commission has considered the elements obtained in relation with Ms Adelina Sotnikova based on the investigations, which have been conducted to date," reads an IOC statement seen by insidethegames.
There have been no reasons given by the IOC Disciplinary Commission as to why any of the four Russians were disqualified.
The IOC Commission chaired by Executive Board member Denis Oswald has spent the past year developing a scientific basis for proving these claims.
Ilia Chernousov - who has not yet been named in connection - was initially third in the 50km mass start cross-country in a Russian 1-2-3.
