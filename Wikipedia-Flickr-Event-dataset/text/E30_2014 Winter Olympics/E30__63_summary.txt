Organisers of the Sochi Winter Olympics are facing an accommodation crisis just days before the opening ceremony after contractors failed to meet deadlines to provide hostels for workers.
An estimated 70,000 policemen, soldiers and other security personnel have been deployed around the greater Sochi area, with strict security and access procedures.
Visitors and Olympic staff have found their movements restricted in unexpected ways.
Olympics workers from around the world saw their registration to the high security Olympic Park blocked since Friday because their names had been wrongly translated into the cyrillic alphabet.
Mine was the only one to be rejected,‚Äù said Mr Simyonov in an interview in his Sochi office.
