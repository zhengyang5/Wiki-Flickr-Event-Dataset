SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Sochi will host a Russian Formula One Grand Prix from 2014-2020 under a deal announced by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Thursday, though the first race could be postponed if it affects Winter Olympics preparations.
“We have reached an agreement with the principal owner of Formula One,” Putin told Russian business leaders at the meeting held in a downtown hotel.
Russian officials said the plan called for the race track to be built near the Olympic park that would host most of the Games events in February 2014.
Sochi, backed by Putin, became the frontrunner to host the event.
Petrov has, however, attracted several Russian sponsors to his team including part Renault-owned carmaker Lada.
