An update on the status of cases involving six Russian cross-country athletes identified in the McLaren Report is set to be provided by the International Ski Federation (FIS) later this week.
Seven ice hockey players, meanwhile, are preparing to become the latest Russians to appear in front of an International Olympic Committee (IOC) Disciplinary Commission hearing tomorrow.
It comes as seven female ice hockey players are set to have hearings before the Oswald Commission in Lausanne tomorrow.
They were initially due to appear in front of the Commission earlier this month before their hearings were postponed.
The identity of the seven ice hockey players, part of a Russian team which finished sixth at Sochi 2014, have not been revealed.
