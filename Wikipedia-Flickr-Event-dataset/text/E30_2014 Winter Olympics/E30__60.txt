On the ninth day of the Games, February 15 2014, gold medal winners will also be awarded with special medals embedded with a fragment of the meteorite which crashed on that date a year earlier.

"We will hand out our medals to all the athletes who will win gold on that day, because both the meteorite strike and the Olympic Games are global events," Chelyabinski Region Culture Minister Alexei Betekhtin said in a statement.

Seven finals are scheduled for that day, including the men's 1,500m speedskating, two short track speedskating events, the men's skeleton and the women's super giant slalom.
