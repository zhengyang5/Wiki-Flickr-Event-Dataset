This is one of the areas being investigated. The family says there was none, but police will probably point to a charging document that says Gray had a switchblade, which is illegal, and could have faced a year in jail if convicted. It is unknown how police knew about the switchblade, however. The knife was found clipped to the inside of his right pants pocket. A comment by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was an indication of just how contentious this question is: "We know that having a knife is not necessarily a crime," she said, calling it "not necessarily probable cause." At a televised news conference Wednesday, police union officials said the officers did not need probable cause because it was a high-crime area.
