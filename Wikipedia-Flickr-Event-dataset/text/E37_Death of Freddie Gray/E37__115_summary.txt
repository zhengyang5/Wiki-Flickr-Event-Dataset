(CNN) Across the world, demonstrators are taking to the streets to support Baltimore protesters and to complain about police brutality in their own towns.
In the United States, the protests took place Thursday in Philadelphia and Cincinnati.
Aerial video showed uniformed officers grouping to push back demonstrators, many who held their hands in the air and chanted, "Hands up."
CNN reporter Ian Lee said several demonstrators told him they were inspired by protests in the United States.
Demonstrators then moved through the city and had several shouting matches with police.
