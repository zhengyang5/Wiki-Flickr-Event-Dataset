A small crowd marched in downtown Seattle in solidarity with others across the United States.
At the heart of Westlake Plaza in downtown Seattle, dozens of protesters gathered with signs and chants.
Using momentum building in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray, who died while in police custody, Emma Kaplan helped organize the protest, hoping to send a clear message.
With Seattle police keeping a close watch, the protest eventually spilled into the streets of 4th and Pine in the height of rush hour, forcing traffic to a halt.
As for Randy Johnson, he just hopes the messages heard today donâ€™t stop here and reach beyond streets of Seattle.
