Kevin Moore, a friend of Freddie Gray’s who filmed the cellphone video of his arrest, said watching the first two trials end without a guilty verdict “weighs extra heavy on me.”Following the mistrial of Officer William Porter, Nero’s acquittal “shows how flawed the system is” in favor of police, Moore said.
“If it was anybody else in that situation, the verdict would have been guilty,” he said.
Dayna Thomas, 52, of Fallstaff, said she felt all the officers charged in Gray's arrest and death should share the blame.
But she shared many residents’ skepticism in prosecutors’ ability to convict the police.
“Truthfully, I don’t think any of them are going to go to jail,” she said.
