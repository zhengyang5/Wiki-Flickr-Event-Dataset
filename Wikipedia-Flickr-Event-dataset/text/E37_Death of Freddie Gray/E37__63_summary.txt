BALTIMORE (WJZ) — Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has been under fire.
A new complaint filed with the Maryland Bar Counsel calls Mosby “a runaway prosecutor” and alleges she violated ethics rules, claiming she never had probable cause to charge six officers in the death of Freddie Gray.
“I think Marilyn Mosby has harmed the city of Baltimore.
Banzhaf, who filed the complaint, accuses Mosby of only filing charges to stop the unrest in Baltimore.
“This is Baltimore, and 33,000 people voted for Marilyn Mosby, and it will take the election to change that,” said Tessa Hill-Aston, NAACP.
