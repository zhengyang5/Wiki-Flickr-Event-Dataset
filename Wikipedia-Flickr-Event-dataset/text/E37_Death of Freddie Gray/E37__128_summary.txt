The wrongful death settlement, which requires final approval by a city board, comes as criminal charges are pending against six police officers in Gray’s arrest and death.
Caption Pre-trial hearings began Wednesday for the six police officers facing charges in Gray’s death.
Gray’s family had not filed a lawsuit in the case, but their attorneys said they intended to once results of investigations by the Justice Department and others were revealed.
The amount proposed for Gray’s family also is greater than the $3.8 million payout to Los Angeles motorist Rodney King in 1994 — which would amount to about $6.2 million today.
Under the proposal, $2.8 million would be paid to Gray’s family this fiscal year and $3.6 million in the fiscal year that begins in July, the city said.
