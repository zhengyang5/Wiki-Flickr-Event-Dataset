Kevin Moore, the man who filmed Freddie Gray's brutal arrest, has now himself been arrested following "harassment and intimidation" from Baltimore police.
Moore was arrested at gunpoint last night along with two other members of Cop Watch, agroup dedicated to filming and documenting police work.
His video of Gray's arrest was shot shortly before the man suffered spinal injuries while in police custody that led to his death.
Moore was asleep in his home on the morning of 12 April, when his uncle yelled to him: "The police are tazing Freddie."
At the time of writing it seems Moore has been released but his colleagues, Chad Jackson and Tony White, have not, with Cop Watch asking for help from lawyers.
