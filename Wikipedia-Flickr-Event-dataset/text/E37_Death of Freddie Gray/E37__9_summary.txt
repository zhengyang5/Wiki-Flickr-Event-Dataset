The medical examiner compared Gray's injury to those seen in shallow-water diving incidents.
The autopsy report was completed April 30, the day before State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby announced criminal charges against the officers.
Officers placed Gray on a metal bench running from front to back along the outside wall of the van.
The second stop occurred a few blocks away on Baker Street, where officers placed an identification band and leg restraints on Gray.
"Reportedly, Mr. Gray was still yelling and shaking the van," the medical examiner wrote.
