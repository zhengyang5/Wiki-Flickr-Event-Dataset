(CNN) Baltimore police officer Caesar Goodson, who drove the van in which Freddie Gray was fatally injured, was found not guilty Thursday on all charges, including the most serious count of second-degree depraved-heart murder.
Baltimore Police Officer Caesar Goodson, #FreddieGray van driver, found Not Guilty on all charges.
That the officer failed to put a seat belt on Gray, Williams said, does not prove that he intended to take him on a rough ride.
Again, Williams disagreed, saying the officer had no way of knowing the "acute distress" Gray was in at the time.
Over the seven-day testimony, the state called 21 witnesses; the defense called on nine.
