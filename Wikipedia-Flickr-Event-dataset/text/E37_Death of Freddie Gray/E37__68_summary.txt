Attorneys for the six Baltimore officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray filed a motion today to try and dismiss the charges against them and also to get State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby to recuse herself, citing potential conflicts of interest brought up by the police weeks ago.
But CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin doesn’t think they have much of a case here.
He pointed out that in Ferguson, people were outraged because the prosecutor there was “on the same side as the cops,” and it’s generally understood that prosecutors will go after the police from time to time.
As for the money she received from one of the Gray family’s attorneys, Toobin said “that’s just how our system is set up” and doesn’t see any serious conflict that should disqualify her from the case.
