As unrest continues to grow in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray, a local police union president on Wednesday stood by comments in which he referred to protesters as a "lynch mob."
Six officers have been suspended, but local civil rights leaders and Gray's family say they have no confidence in the police's investigation into Gray's death.
There was a lynch mob.
"So, for anybody to say that people that exercise their First Amendment right to protest, to demand justice, to demand an investigation, is a lynch mob, itâ€™s 1984," Conway continued.
The Justice Department is also looking into Gray's death.
