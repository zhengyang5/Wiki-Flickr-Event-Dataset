Baltimore’s 10 p.m. curfew, put in place after violent protests following the death of Freddie Gray, was lifted Saturday by the city’s mayor after it had been in effect for five days. It comes just a day after a large rally in the city in support of charges brought against six officers associated with Gray’s death.

Effective immediately, I have rescinded my order instituting a city-wide curfew. I want to thank the people of Baltimore for their patience. â€” Mayor Rawlings-Blake (@MayorSRB) May 3, 2015

“I have rescinded my order instituting a citywide curfew. I want to thank the people of Baltimore for their patience,” Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced on on Twitter Sunday morning.

“My goal has always been to not have the curfew in place a single day longer than was necessary. I believe we have reached that point today,” she wrote in a follow-up tweet.

Her announcement received a mixed reaction on social media. Some responded with messages of thanks, while others were less optimistic.

@MayorSRB Thank you. And know that I am grateful for your commitment and service. â€” jylani ma'at (@jylanimaat) May 3, 2015

@MayorSRB thanks but will you address the brutal treatment of peaceful protestors last night at the hands of BPD and smiling about it â€” Thurston (@SAThurstonDC) May 3, 2015

The emergency curfew was put in place last week and required that all Baltimore residents stay in doors between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. It was originally set to expire at 5 a.m. on Tuesday.

After Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced on Friday that the officers involved would be charged, the city’s protesters remained peaceful during weekend demonstrations.

Also on Sunday, a spokesperson for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told Baltimore Sun reporter Scott Dance that the National Guard will “gradually draw down its presence” in the city. According to the New York Times, the governor activated the units after protests following Gray’s funeral turned violent and ended with looting and buildings set on fire.
