Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake fired Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts Wednesday, saying his presence had become a distraction in a city that needs to focus on ending a dramatic spike in homicides.
"Too many continue to die on our streets, including three just last night and one lost earlier today," Rawlings-Blake said.
Rawlings-Blake, who hired Batts in October 2012, described much of his record in positive terms Wednesday, saying he had instituted many reforms.
Curt Anderson, a Baltimore Democrat, saw Batts' chief failing as not being able to reform the culture of the department.
Batts had relocated to Baltimore from California, where he had long worked in law enforcement.
