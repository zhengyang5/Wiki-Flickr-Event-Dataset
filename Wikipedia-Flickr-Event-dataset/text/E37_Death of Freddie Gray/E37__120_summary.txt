With three men killed in eastside shootings on Sunday, Baltimore recorded its deadliest month in more than 40 years.
The killing of African-Americans in Baltimore has to stop, she said, noting that 189 of the 208 killed last year were black men.
The double homicide occurred around 1:15 a.m. in the 2000 block of Belair Road in the Clifton Park section of East Baltimore, police said.
Baltimore has recorded more homicides in a single month: There were 44 in December 1971 and 45 in August 1972.
During April's riots, thousands of dollars in narcotics and other drugs were stolen from more than 20 Baltimore pharmacies.
