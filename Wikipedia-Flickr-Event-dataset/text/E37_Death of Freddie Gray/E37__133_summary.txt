Lafayette Gilchrist Plays The 'Blues For Freddie Gray'Enlarge this image toggle caption David I Muir/Courtesy of the artist David I Muir/Courtesy of the artistBaltimore's Lafayette Gilchrist is a jazz pianist, but when his band the New Volcanoes backs him up, listeners also get something different: a go-go beat.
Blended with his jazz piano playing, that's the sound of Gilchrist's latest album, New Urban World Blues, released this May.
The album's powerful leading track is "Blues For Freddie Gray," dedicated to the young West Baltimore man who died in 2015 of severe spinal injuries sustained while in the custody of the Baltimore City Police.
Gilchrist is from the part of Baltimore where Gray was arrested, and remembers getting caught in traffic as police shut down part of the city to prevent riots.
It aims to evoke "the inside of a police station where they take you to book you," Gilchrist says.
