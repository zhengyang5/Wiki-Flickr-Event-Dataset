Policeman William Porter is the first of six officers charged in the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray.
Police have been positioned around the city to prevent riots like those that erupted following Gray's death.
The mistrial is a major setback for prosecutors, who may now have to build another case against the policeman.
The prosecution had hoped this case would be resolved before the trials - in January - of the other Baltimore police officers charged over Freddie Gray's death.
Gray's death in April quickly became a flashpoint in a national debate over police use of force - especially against black men.
