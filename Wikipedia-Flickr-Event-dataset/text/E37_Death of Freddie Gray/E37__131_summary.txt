On Monday, the Huffington Post premiered a 2-minute-and-15-second snippet of “Change,” a song inspired by the death of Freddie Gray and other recent fatal incidents involving police officers.
The song features Dru Hill members Sisqo (born Mark Andrews), Jazz (Larry Anthony), Nokio (Tamir Ruffin) and Antwuan Simpson (Tao).
A line from the song, which features the group's trademark harmonies, references Tamir Rice, Mike Brown and others: "I'm Tamir, I'm Trayvon, I'm Mike, Freddie Gray and every other person that should still be here, black or white."
The Sun has reached out to a representative of Dru Hill for more information, and this story will be updated.
