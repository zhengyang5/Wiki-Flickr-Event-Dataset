Kevin Morby’s songs, like the mountains and valleys that populate them, are deep and majestic, stretching out in defiance of the world beyond them.
But even compared to the woodsy anthems of Singing Saw, Morby’s great solo LP from earlier this year, “Beautiful Strangers” feels bold—hymn-like in its simplicity but urgent in its message.
It’s a protest song, with all its proceeds being donated to Everytown for Gun Safety, and Morby uses the song’s six minutes to address issues plaguing the world: gun violence, the death of Freddie Gray, recent attacks in Orlando and Paris.
As far as protest songs go, “Beautiful Strangers” is more “I Shall Be Released” than “Ohio,” a means of finding comfort in the face of fear.
The atmosphere is gentle and meditative: quietly groovy percussion, crisp acoustic guitar, and born-again-Dylan backing vocals echoing Morby’s pleas for peace and solidarity.
