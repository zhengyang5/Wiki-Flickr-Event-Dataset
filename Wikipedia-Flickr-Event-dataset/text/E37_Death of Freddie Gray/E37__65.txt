Embed 'Absolutely Vital That the Truth Comes Out,' Obama Reacts to Baltimore Charges 1:12 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

President Barack Obama said Friday that it is “absolutely vital that the truth comes out” about the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore.

The president’s remarks came after a Baltimore prosecutor announced criminal charges against the six police officers who arrested Gray on April 12. Gray died a week later after suffering a spinal cord injury in custody.

Obama said that he could not comment on the legal process. “But what I think the people of Baltimore want more than anything else is the truth,” he said. “That’s what people around the country expect.”

He also called for protests to be peaceful. Baltimore has been relatively calm since riots on Monday.

“I hope that approach to non-violent protest and community engagement continues,” Obama said.
