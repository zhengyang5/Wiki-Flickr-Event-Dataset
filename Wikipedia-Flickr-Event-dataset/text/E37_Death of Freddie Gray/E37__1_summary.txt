Maryland’s state attorney Marilyn Mosby said Freddie Gray’s death has been ruled a homicide.
“Your peace is sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man.”According to the Associated Press, the Baltimore police officers union said that the six officers are not responsible for Gray’s death.
“It was at this time that Mr. Gray indicated that he could not breathe and requested an inhaler to no avail,” Mosby said.
The officers asked Gray if he needed a medic and, according to Mosby, Gray said two separate times that he needed medical assistance.
“Despite Mr. Gray’s obvious and recognized need for medical assistance,” Mosby said, an officer “in a grossly negligent manner” instead chose to assist in the arrest of a second prisoner at North Avenue.
