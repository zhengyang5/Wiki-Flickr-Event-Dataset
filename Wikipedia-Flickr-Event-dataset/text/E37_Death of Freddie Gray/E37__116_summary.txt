Portland police tweeted that officers used pepper spray when some protestors tried to force their way onto the Burnside Bridge during rush hour.
Police in riot gear then fired loud flash grenades to "allow police to safely withdraw from violent #MayDayPDX crowd," Portland police said on Twitter.
Throughout the day, hundreds of people took to the the streets of downtown to air grievances, promote causes, protest police violence and celebrate International Workers' Day in an amalgamation known as May Day.
May Day protests have become a Portland staple since 2000, when a march of more than 300 protesters had lingering repercussions.
Mara Zusman, a Portland social worker who has been attending May Day rallies for years, said it seems like there are more movements to support now than in the past.
