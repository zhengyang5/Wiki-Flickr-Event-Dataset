I want to thank the people of Baltimore for their patience,” Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced on on Twitter Sunday morning.

After Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced on Friday that the officers involved would be charged, the city’s protesters remained peaceful during weekend demonstrations.
