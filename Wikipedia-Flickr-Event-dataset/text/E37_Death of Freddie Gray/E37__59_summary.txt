All six police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray were released from the Central Booking and Intake Center downtown Friday night after posting bail, court records show.
The officers charged in Gray's death each face multiple charges, with the highest charge being second-degree depraved heart murder, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison.
Defense attorney Warren Brown, who is not involved in the case, said the officers are "entitled to bail based on charges."
According to court records, 18-year-old Allen Bullock was charged rioting, malicious destruction of property, disorderly conduct and theft was being held on $500,000 bail.
Bullock remains in jail, records show.
