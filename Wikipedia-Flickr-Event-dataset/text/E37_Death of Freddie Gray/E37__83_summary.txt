Officer still faces three charges in connection with death of Freddie GrayClosing arguments have concluded Thursday in the trial of Baltimore police Lt. Brian Rice.
He faces manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office charges in connection with Gray's death.
In her closing arguments, prosecutor Janice Bledsoe said Rice had a duty to ensure the safety of Gray.
"It was an intentional act that started a chain leading to the death of Freddie Gray."
"Lt. Rice had the power and control to punish and humiliate Freddie Gray for saying his handcuffs were too tight, screaming 'aaah and yo get off me.'"
