Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and a coalition of two dozen interdenominational leaders issued a "call for peace" Sunday after 35 people were arrested and six police officers were injured in protests over the death of Freddie Gray.
"The Baltimore Police Department believes that outside agitators continue to be the instigators behind acts of violence and destruction."
The out-of-towners' presence was "reflected more than just in the arrest numbers but what we saw on the streets," the mayor said.
Police said city officers worked in collaboration with "local and state law enforcement partners" to restore calm.
