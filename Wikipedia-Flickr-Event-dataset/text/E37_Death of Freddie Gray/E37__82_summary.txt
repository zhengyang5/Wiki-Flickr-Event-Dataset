Brown, a Baltimore defense attorney who is not involved in the Freddie Gray case, talks about the closing statements in Lt. Brian Rice trial.
"If [Rice] had broken that chain, taken one small measure of compassion or humanity," she said, "Freddie Gray would be alive."
The prosecution said Gray was injured before the van's fourth stop, when Porter repositioned Gray on the van's bench.
The timing could play a role in Williams' verdict in the Rice case, legal observers said, because Porter's repositioning of Gray could remove the link between Rice's placement of Gray and his injuries.
