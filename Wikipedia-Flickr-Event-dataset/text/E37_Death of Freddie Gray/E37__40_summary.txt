WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Baltimore on Tuesday to protest the death of a 27-year-old black man who died after being arrested by local police.
Baltimore police have identified six officers suspended over the death, which sparked outrage in the largely black city and renewed concern about U.S. law enforcement’s treatment of minorities.
Officers arrested Gray because he fled when they approached him on a street, an incident captured by bystanders’ video recordings.
A U.S. Justice Department report later said it could not confirm those accounts and said they were not credible.
Gray’s death follows a series of killings of unarmed black men by white police.
