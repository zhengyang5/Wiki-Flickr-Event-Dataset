Eliot Bronson is a Baltimore-born singer-songwriter and Atlanta transplant.
His first album in 2014 earned him comparisons to Jason Isbell, Ryan Adams, and none other than Bob Dylan.
His new record is called “James,” which is a play on the eponymous album title.
“I don’t think of a song like that as ‘hey, I need to take a certain stand on an issue,’” Bronson says.
“I always was drawn to that.”Eliot Bronson celebrates his album release with a pair of shows at the Foundry in Athens on Thursday and at Eddie’s Attic on Saturday.
