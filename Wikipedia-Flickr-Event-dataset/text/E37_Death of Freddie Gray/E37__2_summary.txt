Freddie Gray died from a “significant spinal injury”, police confirmed on Monday, while claiming it remained unknown how he was hurt.
City officials said the investigation would be completed by Friday 1 May and then handed to state prosecutors, who would decide whether or not to bring criminal charges.
During the second stop, another prisoner from a separate incident was placed inside the van in a compartment walled off from Gray.
Rawlings-Blake stressed that city officials appreciated that it was not an offence to “run away”.
Cellphone video of Gray’s arrest released last week showed him being dragged into the police van by officers.
