8:39 a.m. — Four Baltimore bicycle police officers begin chasing Freddie Gray after they make “eye contact” with him and another man at the intersection of W. North Avenue and N. Mount Street in the tough West Baltimore neighborhood.

8:40 a.m. — They catch Gray, pin him down, and cuff him.

8:42 a.m. — Police call for a van and refuse Gray’s request for an inhaler. Minutes later they are videotaped dragging him to the van, which will take him to the West District police station at 1034 N. Mount St.

8:46 a.m. — The van stops and Gray is placed in leg cuffs after police say he became “irate.”

NO SPECIFIC TIME — The van is captured by a private camera stopping for a second time. Police have not said why.

8:59 a.m. — The van stops a third time at the intersection of Druid Hill Ave. and Dolphin St. where the driver asks for an additional unit to check on Gray in the back. Minutes later the van arrives at 1600 W. North Ave. where police pick up a second prisoner.

9:26 a.m. — Paramedics are called to the Western District station to transport “an unconscious male” to the hospital. A week later, on April 19, Gray dies. An autopsy later reveals his spine was severed and his voice box was crushed.
