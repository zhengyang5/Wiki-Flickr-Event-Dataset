The judge presiding over the prosecution of six Baltimore Police officers involved in the arrest of Freddie Gray struck the state's motion for a gag order in the case.
Judge Charles J. Peters ruled the motion lacked standing in an actual proceeding, as it was filed by Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby's office in Circuit Court on May 14.
Rochelle Ritchie, a Mosby spokeswoman, declined to say whether the state planned to file a new gag order motion, which Peters' ruling did not preclude.
The attorneys for the six officers had asked the court to strike the state's gag order motion on procedural grounds.
Nineteen media outlets, including The Baltimore Sun, also filed a motion opposing the gag order.
