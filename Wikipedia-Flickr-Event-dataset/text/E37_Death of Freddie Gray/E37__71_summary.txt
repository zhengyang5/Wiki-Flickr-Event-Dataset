Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby has until June 26 to respond to three defense motions in the trial of six officers in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray, a judge ordered this week.
Attorneys for the six Baltimore officers have filed a motion asking that Mosby be removed from the case.
The defense attorneys have argued Mosby has multiple conflicts of interest; one of them, they contend, is that her husband, City Councilman Nick Mosby, represents the area of West Baltimore where Gray was arrested.
In a previous filing in the case, Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow called the defense attorneys' arguments for Mosby's removal "illogical, unsupported, frivolous, and unprecedented."
Also Friday, the defense attorneys filed a motion reiterating their opposition to the gag order Mosby requested to prevent those involved in the case from speaking about it publicly.
