Prosecutors in Baltimore failed for the fourth time to secure a conviction in the Freddie Gray case, with Circuit Judge Barry G. Williams acquitting Lt. Brian Rice of all charges Monday related to Gray's arrest and death.
Williams cleared Rice, 42, of involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office in a downtown Baltimore courtroom.
Rice chose a bench trial rather than a jury trial, putting his legal fate in Williams' hands.
Another officer's trial ended with a hung jury and mistrial.
