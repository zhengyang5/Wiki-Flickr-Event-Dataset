Kevin Moore, the man who filmed Freddie Gray's brutal arrest, has now himself been arrested following "harassment and intimidation" from Baltimore police.

Moore was arrested at gunpoint last night along with two other members of Cop Watch, agroup dedicated to filming and documenting police work.

His video of Gray's arrest was shot shortly before the man suffered spinal injuries while in police custody that led to his death.

Moore claims that despite having co-operated with two detectives in the Baltimore Police Department’s Office of Internal Oversight and given them the video, police posted his photo and told the public that he was "wanted for questioning", asking people to identify him.

"What is so important that you have to plaster my picture over the Internet? I've already spoken," Moore said, suggesting that they posted it simply to intimidate him. Moore was asleep in his home on the morning of 12 April, when his uncle yelled to him: "The police are tazing Freddie."

He ran out into the street and instantly started filming on his cell phone as Gray "screamed for his life", one officer putting his knee on his neck as the other bent his legs backwards.

"They had him folded up like he was a crab or a piece of origami. He was all bent up," Moore said.

At the time of writing it seems Moore has been released but his colleagues, Chad Jackson and Tony White, have not, with Cop Watch asking for help from lawyers.
