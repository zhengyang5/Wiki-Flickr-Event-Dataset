Gray's family has appealed for peace, but say above all they want the people responsible for his death held accountable.
"Without justice, there is no peace but let us have peace in the pursuit of justice," said Gray's stepfather, Richard Shipley, according to CBS Baltimore.
"My number one priority in instituting a curfew was to ensure the public peace, safety, health and welfare of Baltimore citizens," the Democratic mayor said.
Police said the officers who arrested Gray ignored his cries for help because they thought he was faking his injuries.
"No officers injured Mr. Gray, caused harm to Mr. Gray and they are truly saddened by his death," said FOP lawyer Mike Davey, according to CBS Baltimore.
