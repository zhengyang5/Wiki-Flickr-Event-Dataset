About three weeks before Freddie Gray was chased from a West Baltimore corner by three Baltimore police officers — the start of a fatal encounter — the office of prosecutor Marilyn Mosby asked police to target the intersection with "enhanced" drug enforcement efforts, court documents show.
"Mrs. Mosby herself is now an integral part of the story and as such is a central witness," the defense attorneys argued.
Mosby's office received the motion Tuesday afternoon, Ritchie said.
In their motion Tuesday, defense attorneys said the email exchange shows that Mosby knew the area where Gray was chased was a high-crime location.
Mosby's office said Gray sustained a severe spinal cord injury while being transported in a police van.
