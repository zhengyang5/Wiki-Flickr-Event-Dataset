It's been more than five years since Dru Hill's last album, but the veteran R&B group from Baltimore returned this week with timely new material.

On Monday, the Huffington Post premiered a 2-minute-and-15-second snippet of “Change,” a song inspired by the death of Freddie Gray and other recent fatal incidents involving police officers. Stream the track above.

The song features Dru Hill members Sisqo (born Mark Andrews), Jazz (Larry Anthony), Nokio (Tamir Ruffin) and Antwuan Simpson (Tao).

A line from the song, which features the group's trademark harmonies, references Tamir Rice, Mike Brown and others: "I'm Tamir, I'm Trayvon, I'm Mike, Freddie Gray and every other person that should still be here, black or white."

The Huffington Post also conducted an interview with the group about the current state of Baltimore and what changes they’d like to see in the future.

“We need some positive, creative things to get these kids involved because they don’t believe in nothing anymore,” Jazz said. “A lot of talk has been given and no action.”

As of Tuesday afternoon, “Change” was not available for purchase online.

The Sun has reached out to a representative of Dru Hill for more information, and this story will be updated. (And for a deeper look into the ups and downs of Dru Hill, read my 2012 feature here.)
