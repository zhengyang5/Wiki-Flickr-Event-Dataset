BALTIMORE -- A Baltimore police officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray must testify against his colleagues while he awaits a retrial, Maryland's highest court ruled Tuesday.
The case was unusual because Officer William Porter's first trial ended with a hung jury.
As he was awaiting a retrial, a judge ruled he had to testify against some of the officers charged in the Gray case but not others.
The first ruling agreed with Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams' decision to force Porter to testify against Sgt.
A second order reversed Williams' decision that Porter did not have to testify against officers Garrett Miller, Edward Nero and Lt. Brian Rice.
