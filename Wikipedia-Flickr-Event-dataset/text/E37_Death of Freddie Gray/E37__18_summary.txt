To prosecute the case, the city is turning for the first time to an outside attorney who has never led such a proceeding: Neil Duke, a litigator and former chair of the Baltimore City School Board.
Meanwhile, Lt. Lisa Robinson, president of the Vanguard Justice Society, a group for black city officers, said she had concerns about an officer from another police agency chairing the trial board panel.
Police Department statistics show that few cases advance to trial board hearings.
Only six cases have advanced to a trial board, with four officers found guilty and two acquitted.
T.J. Smith, the chief spokesman for the BPD, said the lineup wonâ€™t be finalized until the day of the trial board hearing.
