Activists Kwame Rose and Makayla Gilliam-Price appeared alongside director Sonja Sohn on Wednesday at the Television Critics Association’s summer meeting to discuss the documentary premiering on HBO in November.
The film chronicles the passionate feelings on all sides after Gray died a week after suffering a critical spinal injury while in police custody in 2015.
