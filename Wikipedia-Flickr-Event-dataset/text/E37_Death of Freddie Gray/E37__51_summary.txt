BALTIMORE, Maryland (NEWSCHANNEL 3) - Prosecutors want a judge to place a gag order on attorneys, police and witnesses in the case of Freddie Gray.
The 25-year-old died in police custody last month after sustaining a spinal injury in Baltimore.
Prosecutors argue that statements by attorneys for some of the six police officers accused in Gray's death could prejudice the public.
Prosecutors say they've denied all media requests for documents and evidence, but they say attorneys for the officers have provided copies of pretrial motions to the media before prosecutors received them.
