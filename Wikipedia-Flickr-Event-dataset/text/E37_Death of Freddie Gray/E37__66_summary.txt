Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby's "quick" and "decisive" action in charging six Baltimore police officers a mere two weeks after the death of Freddie Gray reflects either incompetence or an unethical recklessness.
The breadth of the charges, Ms. Mosby's overreaching, is all-too-obvious.
The Fraternal Office of Police called Ms. Mosby's charges an "egregious rush to judgment."
Instead Ms. Mosby, without all of the evidence yet available to her, pandered to the public by promising "justice" for Freddie Gray.
Page Croyder spent 21 years in the Baltimore state's attorneys office, most recently as a deputy state's attorney.
