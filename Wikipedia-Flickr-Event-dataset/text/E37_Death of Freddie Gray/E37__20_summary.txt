The life of Freddie Gray Jr., who died Sunday from a severe spinal cord and other injuries sustained in police custody, had a beginning as tragic, in a way, as his end.
Baltimore residents protest and officials respond after the death of Freddie Gray, 27, who was injured while he was being arrested on April 12.
"Particularly in a Baltimore lead paint case, you're thrust into a person's life," Naugle said.
Freddie Gray, for example, was tested as having between 11 mg/dL and 19 mg/dL in six tests conducted between 1992 and 1996, court documents show.
William H. "Billy" Murphy Jr., who has been representing Gray's family since his death, declined to comment or make them available for an interview.
