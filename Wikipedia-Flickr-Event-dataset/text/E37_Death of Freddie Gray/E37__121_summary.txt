Taylor Street and Delvin Trusty began dating in high school after he sent her a message on social media.
When she gave birth this month, she was surrounded with support, including Trusty's parents and brother, and her mother, sister and cousin â€” but not Trusty.
Their daughter, a 9-pound, 11-ounce girl named Avah, was born one month to the day that Trusty was gunned down in Northeast Baltimore.
Trusty was among 45 people killed in Baltimore in July, a toll that matched the deadliest month in the city's modern history and came amid a surge in violent crime surge that followed Freddie Gray's death.
The last time 45 people were killed in one month was in August 1972, when the city had about 275,000 more residents.
