Justin Fenton, Baltimore Sun reporter, talks about the rescheduling of William Porter's trial to June and how that might affect the upcoming trials against his fellow officers.
Goodson, whose trial is scheduled for Jan. 6, faces the most serious charge — second-degree murder — of the six officers charged in Gray's arrest and death.
"They need to get Porter up there" on the witness stand, Jaros said, because the Constitution ensures an absolute right to confront witnesses.
"It wasn't a situation where they needed Officer Porter to flip and testify against Officer Goodson; they need him to testify to his statement," Jaros said.
"In some sense, they may have some political cover to give Officer Porter immunity," Jaros said.
