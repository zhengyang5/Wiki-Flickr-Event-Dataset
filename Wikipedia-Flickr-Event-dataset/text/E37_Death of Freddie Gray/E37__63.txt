BALTIMORE (WJZ) — Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has been under fire. Now she could potentially face being disbarred, WJZ’s Meghan McCorkell reports.

A new complaint filed with the Maryland Bar Counsel calls Mosby “a runaway prosecutor” and alleges she violated ethics rules, claiming she never had probable cause to charge six officers in the death of Freddie Gray.

“I think Marilyn Mosby has harmed the city of Baltimore. And if she continues, that harm will get worse,” said law professor John Banzhaf, George Washington University.

Banzhaf, who filed the complaint, accuses Mosby of only filing charges to stop the unrest in Baltimore.

“I heard your call for ‘No justice, no peace.’ Your peace is sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man,” Mosby said in May of 2015.

Banzhaf’s complaint calls Mosby’s words a “misuse of her role” and a “perversion of her office.”

“It’s a crime, it’s unethical to indict somebody simply because it will quell the thirst of a rioting mob,” he said.

In a statement to WJZ, Mosby’s office says: “Because the subject of the grievance related to pending cases for which a judge has imposed a gag order, we cannot and will not make any comments relating to this matter.”

The complaint comes on the heels of a new online petition calling on Mosby to resign.

Still, some activists tell WJZ they stand behind the city state’s attorney.

“She had the courage to do something that’s never been done,” said Perry Hopkins, Communities United.

“This is Baltimore, and 33,000 people voted for Marilyn Mosby, and it will take the election to change that,” said Tessa Hill-Aston, NAACP.

Similar bar complaints could potentially be filed against the other prosecutors involved in the officers’ trials.

The complaint will now be examined by the Maryland Bar Counsel. If accepted, Mobsy will be asked to respond.
