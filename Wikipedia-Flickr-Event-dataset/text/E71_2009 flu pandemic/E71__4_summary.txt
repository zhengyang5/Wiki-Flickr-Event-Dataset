We report on a large U.S. case series of hospitalized patients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection during the first 2 months of the pandemic.
Delayed initiation of antiviral therapy may have contributed to an increased severity of illness.
Studies are ongoing to determine whether the transmission of the 2009 H1N1 virus can occur from exposure to virus shed in stool.
We evaluated only patients with confirmed 2009 H1N1 infection, so the group may not be representative of hospitalized patients who may not have been tested.
Clinicians should consider influenza, including 2009 H1N1 infection, in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with fever and respiratory illness or pneumonia.
