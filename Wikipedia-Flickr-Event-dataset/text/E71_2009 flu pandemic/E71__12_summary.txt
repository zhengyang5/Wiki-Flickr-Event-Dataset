At 15:00 (central European time) on Tuesday 10 August 2010, the Director-General of WHO, Dr Margaret Chan, declared the end of the influenza (H1N1) pandemic.
The Committee considered an epidemiological update on the status of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (in both northern and southern hemispheres), and discussed the status of the pandemic and the need for continuation of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
In addition, it is most likely that, compared with seasonal influenza, younger age groups, including pregnant women, will continue to be affected disproportionately by severe disease due to pandemic (H1N1) 2009, including viral pneumonia.
WHO pandemic influenza preparedness and response guidelines give detailed advice.
WHO/Europe publishes a weekly surveillance report on pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in English and Russian, which is based on data covering the Regionâ€™s total population of 883 million.
