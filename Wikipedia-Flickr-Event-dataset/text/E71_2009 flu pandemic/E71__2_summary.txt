(CNN) -- The World Health Organization raised the swine flu alert Thursday to its highest level, saying the H1N1 virus has spread to enough countries to be considered a global pandemic.
Phase 6, Chan said, is meant as a signal to countries to recalibrate their strategies to minimize the harm from swine flu.
This makes it the first cluster of swine flu cases in the city without a link to someone who had traveled overseas.
Also on Thursday, Israel's health ministry announced that the number of people diagnosed with swine flu there was 68.
