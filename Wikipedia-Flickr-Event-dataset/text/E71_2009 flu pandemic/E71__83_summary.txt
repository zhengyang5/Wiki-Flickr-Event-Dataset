As Mexican health authorities were finding cases of unusual illness, they at least once officially notified the WHO's regional office in Washington, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), of a possibly brewing epidemic.
The full account of the Mexican events will take months to reconstruct.
That same day, Mexican authorities notified PAHO of a worrisome outbreak of atypical pneumonia.
On April 21, he requested by e-mail that two outbreak specialists at the WHO acknowledge that they had gotten the messages and were aware of the Mexican outbreak.
The CDC physician later called back and said he "had done some checking and that there was some chatter in the system" about Mexican events, Wilson recalled.
