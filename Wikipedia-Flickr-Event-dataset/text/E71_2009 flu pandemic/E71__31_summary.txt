The genetic make-up of this swine flu virus is unlike any that researchers have seen.
Discussions are under way as to whether a new vaccine for the swine flu strain should be produced.
The WHO has recommended that vaccine makers continue to manufacture the seasonal flu strain but begin thinking about how to manufacture large doses of a vaccine that incorporates a weakened version of the current swine flu strain.
The United States, for instance, has released one-quarter of its 50 million stockpiled doses of oseltamivir and zanamivir for treatment in the affected states.
