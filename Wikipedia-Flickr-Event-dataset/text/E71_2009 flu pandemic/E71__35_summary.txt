Another limitation of our study is that secondary cases were not confirmed by laboratory testing.
It is therefore likely that some of the secondary cases were not cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza.
Conversely, some of the household contacts with symptoms that did not meet the definition of acute respiratory illness or influenza-like illness were likely to have had 2009 H1N1 influenza.
In general, the positive predictive value of acute respiratory illness for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in persons who are not epidemiologically linked to a case patient is expected to be low.
However, the probability that an acute respiratory illness is caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus is expected to be higher when the onset of symptoms occurs only a few days after the onset of symptoms in a household case patient with laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza.
