Though databases such as GenBank still play a vital role in sharing and archiving influenza viruses, GISAID's EpiFlu database provides a more complete picture of the flu data.
Database exposes new virus structure and spreadIn late April, the first news of the novel H1N1 virus threatened to overwhelm the database, GISAID officials said.
Following the request by governments of countries hit by avian influenza, GISAID also developed on its platform a system for tracking actual samples of H5N1 and other flu strains with pandemic potential.
The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics developed programming for the influenza database.
System yields practical benefitsGISAIDÂ’s EpiFlu went live on May 15, 2008, with Indonesia supporting the project and promising to share its H5N1 sequences, and quickly achieved important milestones.
