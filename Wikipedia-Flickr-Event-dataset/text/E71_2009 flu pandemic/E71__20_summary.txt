Some authorities object to calling the flu outbreak "swine flu".
There are two such medications that are recommended for use against the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).
The 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus is resistant to the adamantane antiviral medications, amantadine and rimantadine.
Crime riskIn early June, the Australian Crime Commission, in a written public report, warned that criminals may exploit a swine flu pandemic.
