H1N1 Swine Flu May Have Killed 15 Times More Than First Said (ABC News)The swine flu virus, H1N1, may have killed 15 times the number of people counted by the World Health Organization, according to a new study.
And unlike the seasonal flu, the H1N1 pandemic struck down mostly young people, many living in Africa and Southeast Asia.
Beginning in 2009, the virus swept the globe, and the WHO counted 18,500 swine flu deaths that had been confirmed by laboratory tests.
Though the virus was deadly, the swine flu pandemic is still considered to have been a fairly mild one.
Both pale in comparison to the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide.
