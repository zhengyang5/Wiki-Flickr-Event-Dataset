It uses a molecular biology technique to detect influenza A viruses and specifically the 2009 H1N1 virus.
"This test is the second diagnostic cleared in recent weeks by the FDA for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus."
The earlier test was developed based on the limited number of 2009 H1N1 specimens available at the start of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in April 2009.
As a result, the new PCR diagnostic test can detect human infections with 2009 H1N1 virus with sensitivity and specificity greater than 96 percent for upper respiratory specimens.
