No one wants to catch the flu, and the best line of defense is the seasonal influenza vaccine.
But producing an effective annual flu shot relies on accurately predicting which flu strains are most likely to infect the population in any given season.
Once epidemiologists settle on target flu strains, vaccine production shifts into high gear; it takes approximately six months to generate the more than 150 million injectible doses necessary for the American population.
Each year, epidemiologists forecast which flu strains are most likely to infect populations, typically settling on three or four.
Researchers then attenuate or inactivate these strains so they can act as the mimics in that year's influenza vaccine without giving recipients the full-blown flu.
