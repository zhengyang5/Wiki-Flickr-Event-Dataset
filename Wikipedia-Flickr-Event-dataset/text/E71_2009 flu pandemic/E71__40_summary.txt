The influenza (flu) viruses selected for inclusion in the seasonal flu vaccines are updated each year based information about which influenza virus strains are identified, how they are spreading, and how well current vaccine strains protect against newly identified strains.
Currently, 130 national influenza centers in 101 countries conduct year-round surveillance for influenza and study influenza disease trends.
The seasonal flu vaccine is a trivalent vaccine (a three component vaccine) with each component selected to protect against one of the three main groups of influenza viruses circulating in humans.
Unlike seasonal flu vaccines, the pandemic vaccine protected against only one flu virus strain, the 2009 H1N1 virus.)
When and where did the WHO group meet to determine the vaccine composition for the 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere?
