Swine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease in pigs caused by one of several swine influenza A viruses.
Current strategies to control swine influenza virus (SIV) in animals typically include one of several commercially available bivalent swine influenza virus vaccines.
However, the swine influenza virus can be transmitted to humans via contact with infected pigs or environments contaminated with swine influenza viruses.
