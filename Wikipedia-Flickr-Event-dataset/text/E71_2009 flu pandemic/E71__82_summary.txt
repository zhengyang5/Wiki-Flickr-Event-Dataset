The swine flu pandemic is "considerably less lethal" than feared, chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson says.
A study led by Sir Liam found a death rate of just 0.026% in those infected, the British Medical Journal reported.
Sir Liam described the low death rate as "fortunate".
"The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century is considerably less lethal than was feared in advance."
Sir Liam also urged people to come forward for immunisation.
