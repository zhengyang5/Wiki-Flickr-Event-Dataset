Some questions remain about who did what in the Roche trials, how patients were recruited, and why some neuropsychiatric adverse events were not reported.
A response from Roche is published in our letters pages (doi:10.1136/bmj.b5364) and their full point by point response is published online (doi:10.1136/bmj.b5374).
Should the BMJ be publishing the Cochrane review given that a more complete analysis of the evidence may be possible in the next few months?
The Cochrane reviewers have told the BMJ that they will update their review to incorporate eight unpublished Roche trials when they are provided with individual patient data.
Individual patient data from all trials of drugs should be readily available for scientific scrutiny.
