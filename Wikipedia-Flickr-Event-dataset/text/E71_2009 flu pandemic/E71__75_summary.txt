Taken together, these indicators underscore the impact that seasonal flu is having on the United States, particularly on younger people.
While activity may be declining in states where the season began earlier, nationally the country is likely to experience several more weeks of high flu activity as flu spreads to other states.
At this time last season (Week 2), the overall hospitalization rate was 23.6 per 100,000; the season concluded with an overall hospitalization rate of 43.8 hospitalizations per 100,000 people.
This hospitalization data is provided by the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network FluSurv-NET, which reports flu hospitalizations in more than 70 counties in 13 states.
Laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization data reported during the 2012-2013 flu season indicated that approximately 46% of children hospitalized with the flu had no identified underlying medical conditions.
