Swine flu could kill hundreds of thousands in U.S. if vaccine fails, CDC saysAs much as 40% of the workforce could be affected during the peak of a pandemic, health officials say, noting low resistance to the H1N1 virus and its persistence through the summer months.
A 2003 CDC study of deaths in the preceding decade showed yearly totals ranging from 17,000 to 52,000.
But the broad range of potential deaths highlights the unpredictability of flu viruses in general and this swine flu virus in particular because it hasn't behaved the way researchers have expected.
So far, the CDC has given no estimate of how many deaths might occur if the vaccine works.
Twenty states are now reporting widespread or regional flu activity, with the H1N1 virus predominating, according to Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
