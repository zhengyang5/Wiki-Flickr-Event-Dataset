The visible symbol of the H1N1 flu outbreak last spring seemed to be face masks.
As the nation girds itself for a renewed fall outbreak, however, masks may make a reappearance.In general, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend use of face masks or respirators in non-health care settings.
Masks are loose-fitting and designed to stop the spread of droplets from the person wearing the mask, not to protect the wearer from viruses.
Masks shouldn't replace other precautions such as hand -washing.Wash your hands with soap and water before putting on a mask.
Inexpensive masks have a limited life span -- only about 30 minutes -- because they become moist and may lose shape and allow particles in.
