World now at the start of 2009 influenza pandemicDr Margaret ChanDirector-General of the World Health OrganizationLadies and gentlemen,In late April, WHO announced the emergence of a novel influenza A virus.
On the basis of available evidence, and these expert assessments of the evidence, the scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met.
I have therefore decided to raise the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to phase 6.
The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic.
Many, though not all, severe cases have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions.
