The genetic makeup of influenza viruses allows frequent minor genetic changes, known as antigenic drift, and these changes require annual reformulation of influenza vaccines.
More recently, two other influenza A pandemics occurred in 1957 (“Asian influenza”) and 1968 (“Hong Kong influenza”) and caused significant morbidity and mortality globally.
Constant genetic changes in influenza viruses mean that the vaccines' virus composition must be adjusted annually to include the most recent circulating influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses.
The network, a partnership of 112 National Influenza Centres in 83 countries, is responsible for monitoring the influenza viruses circulating in humans and rapidly identifying new strains.
Antiviral drugs for influenza are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine for the treatment and prevention of influenza.
