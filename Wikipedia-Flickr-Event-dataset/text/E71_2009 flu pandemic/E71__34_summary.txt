The Canadian PressTORONTO - Scientists from Hong Kong are calling for ramped-up surveillance of pig populations after discovering a new swine flu virus that is a hybrid of the pandemic H1N1 virus and viruses previously found in pigs.
Pigs are called the mixing vessel of flu because they can be infected both by avian flu viruses -- which rarely directly infect people -- and by human viruses.
Over the past year, especially in the early days of the pandemic, H1N1 would have had plenty of opportunities to reassort with human flu viruses in people, Dr. Malik Peiris said.
Late last October, they started finding pandemic H1N1 viruses in some of the pigs.
Pig producers have learned that finding flu viruses in their herds can have costly consequences.
