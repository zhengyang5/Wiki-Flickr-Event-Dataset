Britons Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh and Oliver Pybus of Oxford University, and Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong examined the genetic sequence of the new H1N1 swine flu virus.
They said this new pandemic "provides further evidence of the role of domestic pigs in the ecosystem of influenza A."
"Thus, this genomic structure may have been circulating in pigs for several years before emergence in humans," they added.
Last week the U.S. Agriculture Department said it would launch a pilot surveillance project to look for new strains of flu virus in pigs.
Cooked pork is no threat but live pigs can get influenza as easily as people do and people and pigs can sometimes pass viruses back and forth.
