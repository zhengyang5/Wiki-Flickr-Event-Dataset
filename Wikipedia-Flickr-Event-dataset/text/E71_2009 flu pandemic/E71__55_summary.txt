So far, 30 people have tested positive for swine flu in India.
'The US is the main source (of swine flu) as far as India is concerned,' Minister of State for Health Dinesh Trivedi told reporters here.
The swine flu pandemic is the first since the Hong Kong flu pandemic in 1968, which killed one million people.
He said four other people who had travelled on the same flight along with the students from the US have exhibited swine flu symptoms and are being monitored.
On Monday night, two more people, including a 12-year-old girl, were quarantined after they showed swine flu-like symptoms.
