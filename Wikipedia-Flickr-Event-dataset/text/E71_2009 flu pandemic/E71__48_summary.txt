WHO Director-General’s letter to BMJ editorsBelow you will find a copy of the letter Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) sent to the editors of the BMJ, formerly British Medical Journal, in reference to their article on conflicts of interest at the WHO.
Potential conflicts of interest are inherent in any relationship between a normative and health development agency, like WHO, and profit-driven industry.
In January 2010, I suggested that a review committee, an independent mechanism under the International Health Regulations, be used to evaluate WHO’s performance during the influenza pandemic.
Records of all Emergency Committee meetings were kept, and these and all other documents pertaining to WHO’s pandemic decisions and actions have been placed at the disposal of the Review Committee.
A full record and timeline of events leading to the publication of the 2009 plan have been placed at the disposal of the Review Committee.
