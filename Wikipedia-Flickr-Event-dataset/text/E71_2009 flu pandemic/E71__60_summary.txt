Selection criteria Randomised placebo controlled studies of neuraminidase inhibitors in otherwise healthy adults exposed to naturally occurring influenza.
Conclusion Neuraminidase inhibitors have modest effectiveness against the symptoms of influenza in otherwise healthy adults.
Neuraminidase inhibitors might be regarded as optional for reducing the symptoms of seasonal influenza.
Partly because of the rise in resistance to amantadine and rimantadine and the lack of an effective vaccine, neuraminidase inhibitors became a widespread public health intervention.
