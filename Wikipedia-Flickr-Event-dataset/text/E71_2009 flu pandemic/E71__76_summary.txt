When the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak began in April 2009, CDC began tracking and reporting the number of laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and deaths as reported by states to CDC.
(Information about surveillance and reporting for 2009 H1N1 is available at Questions and Answers: Monitoring Influenza Activity, Including 2009 H1N1.)
Therefore, CDC continues to encourage 2009 H1N1 vaccination for anyone who wants to protect themselves against 2009 H1N1.
In addition, minority populations have been harder-hit by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic than non-minority groups (See "Information on 2009 H1N1 impact by Race and Ethnicity.)"
To see the tables associated with the earlier time periods for which CDC provided estimates, please see the April 2009 - March 13, 2010, the April 2009 - February 13, 2010, the April 2009 - January 16, 2010, the April - December 12, 2009 estimates, the April - November 14, 2009 estimates, and the April - October 17, 2009 estimates.
