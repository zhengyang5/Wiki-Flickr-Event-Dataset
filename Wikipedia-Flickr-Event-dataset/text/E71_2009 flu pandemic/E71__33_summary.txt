Swine flu has hit about 1 in 6 Americans, CDC saysNearly 10,000 people have died from H1N1, but that is a lower mortality rate than in regular flu seasons, the CDC chief says.
Estimates released about a month ago showed 22 million Americans had been infected and that 3,900 had died.
In a normal flu season, there are about 1,000 deaths among Americans under 50.
H1N1 flu vaccine supplies continue to grow, he said.
Frieden recommended that people get the H1N1 flu vaccine because of uncertainties about whether a new wave of infections will hit in 2010.
