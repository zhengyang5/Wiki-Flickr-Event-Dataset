Experts advise WHO on pandemic vaccine policies and strategiesPandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 1430 October 2009 | GENEVA - The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, which advises WHO on policies and strategies for vaccines and immunization, devoted a session of its 27â€“29 October meeting to pandemic influenza vaccines.
Items on the agenda included the status of vaccine availability, results from clinical trials on vaccine immunogenicity, and early results from safety monitoring in countries where administration of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine is currently under way.
Overall, from 7% to 10% of all hospitalized patients are pregnant women in their second or third trimester of pregnancy.
Vaccine safetyThe experts reviewed early results from the monitoring of people who have received pandemic vaccines and found no indication of unusual adverse reactions.
Two options were assessed: a trivalent vaccine, effective against the H1N1 pandemic virus, the seasonal H3N2 virus, and influenza B viruses, and a bivalent seasonal vaccine, effective against H3N2 and influenza B viruses, which might need to be supplemented with a separate monovalent H1N1 pandemic vaccine.
