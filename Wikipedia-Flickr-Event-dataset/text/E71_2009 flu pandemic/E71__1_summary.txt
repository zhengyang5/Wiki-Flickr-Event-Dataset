In April 2009, a new strain of human H1N1 influenza A virus was identified in Mexico.
History of Reassortment Events in the Evolution of the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Virus.
The segments of the human 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus have coexisted in swine influenza A virus strains for more than 10 years.
Nucleotide Identities of Swine Influenza A Viruses Most Similar to the Ancestor of Segments 6 and 7 of the 2009 Swine-Origin Human Influenza A (H1N1) Virus.
These numbers suggest that researchers have sampled human influenza A viruses efficiently â€” and point to a high degree of homogeneity among human influenza A viruses.
