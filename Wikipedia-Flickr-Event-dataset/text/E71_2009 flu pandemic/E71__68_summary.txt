The official swine flu deaths are from patients who were confirmed by lab tests to have been infected with the H1N1 strain.
That's why the 2,000 or so certified flu deaths represent an underestimate of the flu's real cost.
But a statistical technique called regression allows us to find the value of X such that the formula[Total deaths] = [Deaths if there were no such thing as flu] + X*[number of confirmed flu cases]Advertisementmatches the data as closely as possible.
The rightmost term, X*[number of confirmed flu cases], is then our estimate for the number of deaths you can attribute to flu.
And if 18,000 specimens test positive for flu over the course of a year, you'd blame 36,000 deaths on the flu.
