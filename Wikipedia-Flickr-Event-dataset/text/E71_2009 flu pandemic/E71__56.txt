Egypt orders pig cull

Updated

Egypt has ordered the immediate cull of all pigs in the country as a precaution against swine flu, Health Minister Hatem al-Gabali said, in the first such move in the world.

"It has been ordered to immediately begin the slaughter of all herds of pigs in Egypt," Mr Gabali said after a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.

He said slaughterhouses were to begin the culling process on Wednesday (local time) at the fastest rate possible.

Further precautionary measures such as the launch of an awareness campaign and an increase in the production of protective masks and the antiviral drug Tamiflu would also be taken, he said.

Egypt's agriculture ministry says there are 250,000 pigs in the country, belonging to and eaten by members of the Coptic Christian minority.

Pig rearers in Cairo's slums - mostly Christian rubbish collectors - were outraged by the reaction.

"Our pigs are healthy. They are our capital and they have no diseases," said Adel Ishak, a rubbish collector from Manshiet Nasser, north-east of Cairo.

"How will they replace the capital if these pigs are killed?," the father of 10 said.

Ayman Saad, who raises pigs in Batn al-Baqqar, said authorities had told him he would receive compensation of about 600 pounds.

"How long will the compensation feed us for? A year? Is the government going to pay for our children's education?," Mr Ishak complained.

The swine flu outbreak that began in Mexico has raised fears of a global pandemic after suspected and confirmed cases were detected in parts of Europe, the United States and New Zealand.
