PML-N member claims that he person­ally spoke with three PTI senior leader­s

ISLAMABAD: Addressing a press conference outside the Parliament House in Islamabad, Minister for Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique maintained a fine balance between conciliatory politics and defiance.

As part of the PML-N’s continuing diplomatic efforts to defuse the political crisis, Rafique, who belongs to PML-N, claimed that he personally spoke with three PTI senior leaders, namely Arif Alvi, Asad Umar, Shah Mehmood Qureshi. He did not disclose the minutes of the conversation, but did maintain that negotiations are ongoing.

Given that the area is sensitive and full of security officers, and that it is the self-professed aim of the marchers to drag Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif out of parliament, “Does the PTI have a remote control with which it can control its marchers?” Rafique quipped.
