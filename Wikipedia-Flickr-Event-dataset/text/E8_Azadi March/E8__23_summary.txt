Zardar­i demand­s probe, arrest of perpet­rators­ISLAMABAD: The leadership of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has condemned the attack on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s Azadi march convoy.
In an official statement released through PPP spokesperson Farhatullah Babar on Friday, former president and party co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the incident.
The PTI convoy, in particular party chief Imran Khan’s vehicle, was pelted with stones as it passed through Gujranwala.
Zardari termed the incident an “unacceptable demonstration of intolerance towards political dissent,” and said it would only add to existing tense political situation.
Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) leaders Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi held Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif responsible for the attack.
