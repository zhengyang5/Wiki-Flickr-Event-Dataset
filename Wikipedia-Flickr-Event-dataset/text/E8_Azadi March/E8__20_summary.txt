Asserting that the PTI would bring the nation’s money back, he pledged that his party leaders would keep their accounts in the country.
He said the PTI (when in power) would imprison all “Gullu Butts” and added that the government should order release of his party workers.
“Otherwise I will go to police stations and get them released.” He said Gullu Butts in police had also stopped PTI workers from reaching Lahore.
Addressing PTI supporters in Karachi, Sindh and Balochistan, the PTI chief apologised for not giving them due attention because he was busy confronting the Sharifs.
PTI workers and supporters had started converging on Faisal Chowk around 12 noon and were kept engaged with party songs.
