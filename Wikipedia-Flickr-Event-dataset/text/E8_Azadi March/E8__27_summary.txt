“As a goodwill gesture, we have decided to constitute two separate committees to negotiate with PTI and PAT,” said Nisar while addressing a press conference late Sunday night.
Earlier in the day, PAT chief Tahirul Qadri and PTI chief Imran Khan reiterated their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in separate addresses to their supporters, with the latter announcing the launch of a civil disobedience movement.
The interior minister said that the committees would be announced on Monday, and would be comprised of leaders of different political parties.
Nisar claimed that despite provocations by the PTI and PAT, the government exercised restraint and facilitated the long marchers.
The minister further claimed that one billion rupees had been spent on the security of the supporters so far.
