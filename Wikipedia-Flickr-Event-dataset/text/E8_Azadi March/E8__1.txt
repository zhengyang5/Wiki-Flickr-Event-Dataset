ISLAMABAD: Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri have called for the government to resign, vowing to continue their ‘long marches’ in the capital till their demands are met.

PTI chief Imran Khan warned that his ‘tsunami’ could cross into the Red Zone and in front of Parliament and the PM House, if his demands are not met on time.

On the other hand, PAT chief Dr Tahirul Qadri presented a list of 15 demands, calling for the federal and provincial assemblies to resign and for the Sharifs to be arrested. He gave the government 48 hours to implement his demands.

Both parties have set up stage at the edge of the Red Zone near Aabpara Market and Aabpara Chowk respectively.

The government, which is facing arguably its toughest challenge since it came into power 15 months ago, is bracing in the capital’s Red Zone, which remains blocked off with shipping containers.

Q: Sarah Farukh @sarahfarukh Imran Khan is surrounded by seasoned politicians. Don’t you think there is a plan B?

He gets a ranking place in a political party because of the captive votes of his followers, not because of his political acumen. We all know the careers of Shireen Mazari, Shafqat Mehmood and Jehangir Tareen. So who among them has the political wisdom to draft a plan B.
