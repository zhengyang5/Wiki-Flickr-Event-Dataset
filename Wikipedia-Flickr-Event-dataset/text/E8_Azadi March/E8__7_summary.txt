Khan has hammered the claim of rigging in elections for long, especially focusing on four constituencies.
However, Khan’s demand for voters thumb verification can only materialise once the election tribunals direct NADRA, the National Database and Registration Authority, to do so.
There is a possibility that Justice Nasir-ul Mulk, the next Chief Justice and current acting Chief Election Commissioner, would come in the crosshairs of Khan’s political agenda if the former Cricket captain keeps up the ante.
Khan’s call for political agitation is currently finding no takers in Sindh and Balochistan.
But in Punjab, Qadri’s return, which was hastened by the Chaudhrys of Gujrat, has forced Khan to step up calls for street agitation.
