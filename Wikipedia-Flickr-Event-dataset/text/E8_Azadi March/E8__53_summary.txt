Speaking at Karachi Press Club (KPC) on Thursday, Siddiqui said that both the leaders, Imran Khan and Dr Tahirul Qadri, have encouraged political polarisation in the country.
He said that the country has lost $6 billion because of the sit-ins in Islamabad going on for the last 40 days.
Siddiqui, who was visiting KPC for the first time, said the government won’t use power against PTI and PAT, adding that the door of dialogue is always open for them.
Comparing the charter of democracy (CoD) with PTI and PAT top leadership’s meeting in London, PM’s special assistant declared the latter as charter of destruction.
Siddiqui said that Qadri wants to make the reform committee as supreme, adding that the PAT leaders wanted separate budget for it.
