Moreover, State Minister for Water and Power Abid Sher Ali Khan criticizing PTI leaders said that people have rejected politics of agitation.
Abid Sher Ali claimed that demands of Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri are unconstitutional.
If it depends on the strength of followers in protest rallies, then Qadri’s rally is much bigger than Imran Khan’s, he said.
PMLN senator Mushahid Ullah Khan said that the public has rejected the demands of Imran Khan already.
The country cant work on the desire’s of a rigid person, he further claimed, adding that Imran Khan’s supporters have felt defrauded as they were deserted by their leader and his fake promises.
