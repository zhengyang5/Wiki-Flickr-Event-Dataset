An Interview with Pervaiz Rasheed: We will refrain from using force against people camping outside ParliamentAn Interview with Pervaiz Rasheed: We will refrain from using force against people camping outside ParliamentIslamabad: The government will refrain from using force against people sitting outside Parliament and will follow its policy of restrain because Pakistan Awami Tehrik (PAT) and Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaaf (PTI) are using women and children as human shield and wish to get dead bodies and bloodshed out of their protests.
Q: Do you think there are similarities between Maidan Euro Kiev Ukraine movement that compelled Ukraine President to run from country and camping village outside Parliament in Islamabad?
These groups who are sitting outside parliament are using children and women as human shield.
Today people understand these elements are sitting outside Parliament to harm country not the government only.
People have rejected those in media who crossed professional lines and became political forces against parliament, democracy and constitution.
