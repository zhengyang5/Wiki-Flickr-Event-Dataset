Lahore bar associ­ation says public functi­onarie­s should stop politi­cal partie­s from spread­ing anarch­yISLAMABAD: The Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) has moved a petition in the Supreme Court against the ‘Inqilab’ and ‘Azadi’ marches in the capital and the PTI-led civil disobedience movement, announced by PTI chairman Imran Khan.
LHCBA president Shafqat Mahmood Chohan filed a petition against the protests on Monday under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution.
Chohan contended that fundamental rights of citizens have been violated by the leaders of the political parties leading the protests.
Earlier, the Supreme Court Bar Association filed a similar petition.
On August 15, the Supreme Court restrained all state functionaries from taking any unconstitutional steps during the current protests.
