LAHORE (Dunya News) – The government and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) came on the confrontation course on Saturday when the PTI leadership insisted that the planned long march scheduled to take place on August 14 will take place as planned.
PTI warned that another incident like Model Town tragedy can take place if the government tried to stop the planned long march, Dunya News reported.
PTI’s vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that PTI had announced its ‘Azaadi March’ way before the government’s Independence Day celebrations announcement.
Qureshi warned that if permission for long march is not given then the incidents like Model Town tragedy can repeat themselves.
Another PTI leader Shafquat Mehmood said that the announcement to celebrate 2-weeks long Independence Day proves government’s helplessness and panic.
