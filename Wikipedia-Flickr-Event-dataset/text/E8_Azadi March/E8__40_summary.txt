Continuing with its streak of rallies against electoral fraud in Pakistan’s 2013 general elections, PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) held its Sargodha Jalsa today.
Shah Mehmood said PTI’s Multan victory was a game changer in political terminology.
“In Multan, Imran Khan took two wickets (of PMLN and PPP) with a single delivery”, said Shah Mehmood.
Learning from Multan incident, Sargodha Jalsa was managed in a more efficient way.
Imran Khan appreciated managers of Sargodha Jalsa for their efforts.
