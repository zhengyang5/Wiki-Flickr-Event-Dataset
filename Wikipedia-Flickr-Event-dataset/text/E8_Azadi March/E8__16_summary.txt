Before the announcement, there was a great deal of speculation about what Dr Qadri planned to do next: would he take some new action or wind up his campaign.
The declaration was a vindication of the efforts made by some political leaders —particularly Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi and Sheikh Rashid — who had been working hard for some kind of an arrangement between the forces led by Dr Qadri and Imran Khan.
The PAT chief said his was a non-violent movement, but at the climax of his speech he urged his supporters to take revenge if he was assassinated.
Meanwhile, a multi-layer security cover for Dr Qadri has been put in place by the PAT.
PML-Q leaders Chaudhry Shujaat and Pervaiz Elahi left their Gulberg residence in a caravan to attend the Model Town event in the afternoon.
