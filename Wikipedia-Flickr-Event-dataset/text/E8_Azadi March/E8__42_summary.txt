PPP vows not to support any step against democracy 08 August, 2014ISLAMABAD: Leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Khursheed Shah on Thursday blamed the elements "more loyal than the king for the mess created in the country" and warned all parliamentary parties to avoid taking any step against democracy that would place their names in the list of dictators.
He urged all political parties to act to remove these apprehensions.
About the struggle for democracy, Shah said that it is not always easy to restore democracy and credited the former PPP government for restoring and strengthening it "through reconciliation and sacrifices".
Shah assured the House that the PPP believes in the supremacy of parliament and will not favour any step against democracy.
