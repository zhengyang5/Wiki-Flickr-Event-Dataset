Jamaat-e-Islami chief Sirajul Haq held meetings with PTI chief Imran Khan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, opposition leader Khursheed Shah and Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai to cool down the political temperature and find a solution to the political impasse.
Meanwhile, PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari phoned Imran Khan for the second time in two days, and PAT chief Tahirul Qadri in Lahore.
"If you (PM) are meeting all political leaders, why don't you meet Imran Khan?"
"I have conveyed some suggestions to the prime minister on how to resolve the current political crisis," Siraj told newsmen after his meeting with PM Nawaz.
Sirajul Haq urged Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to come forward and address the complaints of the opposition parties regarding the alleged vote fraud in the last elections.
