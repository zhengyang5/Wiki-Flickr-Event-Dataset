(Reuters) - As twin protests in Islamabad entered a fifth day on Tuesday, Pakistan police said they had arrested some 150 supporters of protest leaders overnight in Punjab province in a crackdown ahead of widening demonstrations in the capital.
Police in Punjab, Pakistan's wealthiest and most populous province, arrested 147 supporters of Khan and Qadri overnight to prevent them joining the protests in Islamabad, said Inspector Rana Hussain in the central town of Sargodha.
The government has not said whether Khan would be able to proceed to the Red Zone or not.
Qadri has said he will meet his supporters later on Tuesday to consider whether to march alongside Khan.
Their protests have so far remained separate because the two have different supporters and plans for what should happen if Sharif steps down.
