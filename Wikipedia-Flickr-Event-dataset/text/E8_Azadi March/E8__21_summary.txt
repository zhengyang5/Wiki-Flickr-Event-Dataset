Imran tweeted on microblogging website Twitter that 300 to 400 PML-N men resorted to stone-pelting.
PML-N workers also resorted to firing, Abbas and Nadeem claimed.
The PTI rally had arrived in Gujranwala at 10am on Friday and workers welcomed the convoys with celebratory firing and horse dancing.
“We should not jump to any conclusion as it is yet not clear who attacked the rally,” Rashid said.
He has also sought a report from the IGP Punjab and directed for the arrest of those who pelted stones at the PTI rally.
