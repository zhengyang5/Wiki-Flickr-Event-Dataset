A Pakistan opposition politician says he'll lead thousands of protesters into the capital's high-security "Red Zone" as his 48-hour deadline for the government to step down ends.
Khan said the protest will begin Tuesday and that demonstrators will be peaceful, but it raises the possibility of a violent confrontation.
Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan has repeatedly said no one would be allowed to enter the high security zone, which is protected by police and blocked off with shipping containers.
Tens of thousands of people have descended on the capital in recent days, answering the call from cricket-star-turned-politician Imran Khan and anti-government cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri to push for the government's ouster.
Residents say protesters -- mostly women -- knock on their doors early in the morning, hoping to use their bathrooms.
