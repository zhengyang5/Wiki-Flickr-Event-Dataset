Addressing the joint session of Parliament, following the instructions of Imran Khan, PTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi says he has come to the Parliament to clarify his party’s stance.

“We are protesting to save the Parliament, not to destroy it,” he says.

“PTI never was and never will be part of a grand plan that will undermine democracy,” clarifies Qureshi.

“We are protesting on the directions of the Pakistani nation,” he says explaining that the protests are not scripted.

“I want to be on record; my party opposes the invoking of Article 245,” says Qureshi.

Further, Qureshi says he has not come to Parliament for mediation or facilitation but for a resolution to the crisis.

“We embarked on this journey after agreeing on four points,” Qureshi says, adding, “Our points were that our struggle will be democratic, within the realm of the Constitution, our movement will be peaceful and we will defy martial law.”

Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Khursheed Shah stands up and says: “Nobody has a right to interrupt,” calming down other parliamentarians objecting Qureshi’s claims.

“PTI throughout the march has stayed within the law, I can speak for my party,” he says.

Earlier, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar left the house as Qureshi started his speech but now Nisar is back.

“Imran sent me to meet Qadri to ask him what the agenda of his party was,” says Qureshi, adding, “Qadri assured me that their struggle was peaceful, democratic and similar to PTI’s.”

“Just as Imran said he will come out on the streets if rigging allegations in four constituencies were not probed, Qadri gave a deadline for the registration of an FIR in the Model Town incident,” says the PTI vice chairman.

Directing the government, Qureshi thanks them for letting them stage their sit-in. However, he angrily asks who he should thank for those killed and injured during the clashes.

‘This is a deadlock, where do we go from here?” asks Qureshi. “We are here today because of the impasse,” he adds.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar stands up in the middle of Qureshi’s speech and refutes his statements regarding meeting on democratic neutral grounds for meetings. However, NA speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq asks Dar to take a seat and Qureshi to continue with his speech.

“We are going to meet the political jirga at 4pm today,” he says, adding that the talks but lead to positive results or someone might try to sabotage them.

Explaining the current deadlock in talks, Qureshi says, “We argued on one point — the resignation of the prime minister.”

“The government said the premier’s resignation is non-negotiable,” he adds.

“The temple of democracy should be built on a free and fair election,” says Qureshi inviting all parties to join them in the pursuit of this goal.

Questioning if PTI was the only party who claimed that the 2013 elections were rigged, Qureshi firmly says all political parties expressed concerns with election results.

“We have to make a new beginning for the future of Pakistan,” Qureshi says, adding, “At 4pm today we will present our point of view.”

As Qureshi concludes his address, NA speaker summons Qureshi in his chamber.

PTI MNAs walk out of Parliament as parliamentarians scream: “They will not resign.”

It must be noted, Qureshi did not discuss resignations from the NA and provincial assemblies in his address.

Nationalist Party’s Acting President Senator Mir Hasil Bizenjo, during the second day of the joint session of Parliament, says he has not seen such a lavish long march.

“The Long march is either having breakfast or lunch or dinner; this is not how a long march is done,” he says.

Bizenjo says the two protest groups have abused political parties, adding that this is not how politics is done.

Criticising the Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) chief, he remarks that Qadri wants to change the system in Pakistan just because he is here.

The NP leader further says that everyone is sad about the Model Town tragedy but such an incident should not be used as an excuse to attack the Parliament.

“We will not let this happen,” he adds.

“If you are saying that the Constitution of Pakistan should not be there then in other words you are saying that Pakistan is not there,” he says.

“Do you want to make Parliament a graveyard; whoever wants to do this we will bury their politics over here only, we have not given sacrifices to make the Parliament a graveyard.”

Speaking about relations with China, he says “China is our great friend and wants to invest 34 billion dollar but the President, who is scheduled to come tomorrow, is thinking about whether he should come or not.”

“If he does not come then I will question whether these protests were against PM Nawaz or Pakistan,” he adds.

“You need to have political ethics for politics.”

“You talk in politics, conduct dialogue; there is not trash talking or personal attacks,” he remarks.

“I request PTI and PAT to act with patience; this country is yours as much as the prime minister as well as an average citizen,” he states.

Concluding his speech, Bizenjo says Pakistan should be taken out of three things namely poverty, illiteracy and unemployment.

Today’s joint session was opened by Information Secretary of the Awami National Party Zahid Khan, in which he states that there is a conspiracy against the 18th amendment.

“We have made a joke out of this country” he said.

Further, he says “how do we have the audacity to point our finger onto others, when we ourselves cannot handle our own nation?”

Khan went on to commend PTI leader Javed Hashmi in his statements made yesterday.

“In order for Pakistan to remain strong, the constitution must be saved,” he adds.

He referred to the Model Town tragedy and questioned why nobody is fighting for those who died in the May 12 incident in Karachi.

“There are those who are shedding crocodile tears for the 14 deaths in the Model Town tragedy, what about the ones who died on May 12 in Karachi? Were they not human? Were they not Muslims and Pakistanis? Why is nobody doing anything for them?”

Imran questions PPP leader Aitzaz Ahsan why he isn’t standing with him even though they protested together for the restoration of democracy.

“I was striving for democracy then and I am striving for democracy now,” he says.

“I have never respected any politician more than Javed Hashmi,” says Imran, adding that he is extremely disappointed over Hashmi’s allegations that the army and Supreme Court judges are backing him.

“Hashmi was sitting right next to me 13 months ago when I said if we do not get justice by the summer of 2014, we will have to bring people out on the streets,” says the PTI chief.

“Hashmi sb, you know I have never followed anyone’s dictations,” he says, adding, “General Pervez Musharraf offered me prime ministership but I didn’t accept it.”

“In 2000, General Musharraf filed a case against the Sharif family in NAB, accusing them of money laundering,” Imran adds.

In what ultimately was Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf president Javed Hashmi’s resignation speech, the leader pulled no punches as he roundly criticised Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for neglecting parliament, and PTI chairman Imran Khan for compromising it.

In the process, he reinforced his own stature as a dissident, loyal only to democracy, the Constitution, and the state, while reiterating that it isn’t Imran Khan that should be scrutinised, but Parliament.

In a fiery half hour speech that was at times long winded, Hashmi hardly reserved his ire for one party, or one person in particular. In fact, his speech was a harsh reminder to the entire Parliament of the danger it is currently in.

Excerpts from exclusive Express News interview with Javed Hashmi

PTI president Hashmi insinuates that he wasn’t really sick during the marches when he was admitted into a hospital or when he went back to Multan.

“When he changed his direction and began moving towards the PM House on someone’s else’s direction, I decided not to walk with him any longer,” says Hashmi.

“Every step I took, I was alone. If I voiced my opinion, Imran would say ‘trust me, I’m a democrat’. I didn’t say anything when we came to Islamabad. We figured we would form a group and keep him in control,” says Hashmi

Talking about Sheikh Rasheed, Hashmi said, “For him [Sheikh Rasheed], our entire election scheme for Rawalpindi was changed for the 2013 elections. There was a lot of anger in our party. Later, he was made an adviser,” Hashmi adds.

He goes on to add that whatever sacrifices will be rendered, will be rendered by PTI; not Sheikh Rasheed. “In fact, he’s not even submitted his resignation in Parliament,” Hashmi reveals.

“Imran told me that we will go no further. He promised me that he would not take any step that would put the system in danger. When I reminded him of this, he told me that ‘if you don’t want to continue with me, you are free to go,’” the PTI president adds.

He says he felt that there would be a situation where trouble would break out, and Imran would simply stand there and announce that there should be no violence or hooliganism – even if it meant some of PTI’s supporters went and joined in the trouble.

“He told me: trust me, I’m a democrat. This won’t happen,” says Hashmi but questions what Imran is doing now?

“Today, this is exactly what happened,” says Hashmi.

Further, Hashmi reveals that Rs100-120 million spent thus far on this entire march and sit in. “Three days ago, I got the feeling that there was a shortage of funds creeping up,” says Hashmi.

“I have praised the ISI in my upcoming book. They have played a role in saving Pakistan but their political wing creates misunderstandings,” Javed Hashmi adds, “They are our beloved; but I would like them to remain just that.”

“I had advised Imran Khan several times that we must find our own way, and not rely on support from anyone,” says Javed Hashmi. “I felt that there was an unseen force making us take certain decisions,” says Hashmi.

Shah Mehmood Qureshi works hard for his career, says Hashmi.

“Qureshi was not very close to Imran in the early days, but later on he won his trust and became very close to him,” Hashmi adds.

“I didn’t see any such bad intention in Shah Mehmood. The one complaint I have with him is that he coordinated too much with Dr Qadri. But I don’t think he had any ill designs or intentions,” says Hashmi.

“Six odd people who were very close to Imran Khan talked about all these military matters, such as which corps commander is with us, whether the DG ISI is with us,” says Hashmi.

“Imran trusted them. Jehangir Tareen was among them; Sheikh Rasheed, too was very close. He would whisper in Imran’s ear and then leave. He used to do the same with Nawaz years ago.

They were this sort,” Hashmi adds.

Arif Alvi was not this sort. He is a true political worker, says Hashmi.

Imran Khan asked me not to worry, as a judge would order for re-elections, says Hashmi. He added that three member committee was also selected to manage the affairs of the next elections as Imran was sure about midterm elections.

Hashmi says he was concerned that a lot of Imran’s inner circle had started talking about military matters.

“I don’t have any evidence nor do I think the army is backing Imran,” says Javed Hashmi.

It’s an alphabetical nightmare: the PML-N, the PTI, the PAT and GHQ locked into a steely embrace with the PPP, the JI and others hovering around to help untie the knot. The steely resolve to find a negotiated way out of this maze is however still elusive. The wire is stretched to breaking point, ready to snap any moment and lash around like a snarling steel snake.
