Teache­rs, parent­s expres­s concer­n over delay in openin­g school­s.

ISLAMABAD: The summer vacations of the educational institutes have been extended till August 31 for the third time owing to the political standoff in the capital.

The educational institutes of the capital were originally to open on August 11 but the ongoing protests and sit-ins by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and the Pakistan Awami Tehreek forced the Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) to extend it till August 25.

Over 50 schools and colleges in the capital were in the occupation of police called in from Punjab and the Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan Rangers to assist the capital police in maintaining law and order situation.

An official at the Federal Directorate of Education told The Express Tribune that unless the buildings were vacated by personnel of the law enforcement agencies, no date could be given for starting academic activities of the new session.

Parents and teachers have expressed concern over the delay in opening of schools and colleges which may affect the education of the students.

“The government should make alternative arrangements to accommodate the law enforcement personnel as our academic year is already tight,” Federal Government Teachers’ Association President Sagheer Mirani said.

The Federal Urdu University of Sciences and Technology has also been closed till August 25 as protesters have parked their vehicles outside its building. “We cannot put the students as well as our lives at risk,” said campus in-charge Abdul Razzaq Memon.
