Inspired by events in Kiev Ukraine at Maidan (EuroMaidan).



The Euromaidan protest movement began on 21 November 2013, as a peaceful protest but escalated into a terrible battle.



According to journalist Lecia Bushak writing in the 18 February 2014 issue of Newsweek magazine, "EuroMaidan has grown into something far bigger than just an angry response to the fallen-through EU deal. It's now about ousting Yanukovych and his corrupt government; guiding Ukraine away from its 200-year-long, deeply intertwined and painful relationship with Russia; and standing up for basic human rights to protest, speak and think freely and to act peacefully without the threat of punishment."
