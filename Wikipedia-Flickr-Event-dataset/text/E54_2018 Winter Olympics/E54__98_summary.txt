US says North Korea cancelled planned meeting with US VP Mike PenceUS Vice President Mike Pence was all set to hold a history-making meeting with North Korean officials during the Winter Olympics in South Korea, but Kim Jong Un's government cancelled at the last minute, the Trump administration said.
Pence led the US delegation to the opening ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea, amid dramatic speculation that the United States and North Korea might finally sit down to talk.
United States Vice President Mike Pence's meeting with North Korean officials was cancelled.
On Tuesday, the vice president's office said that North Korea had "dangled a meeting'' with Pence in hopes that doing so would entice Pence to ease up on the North.
But North Korean officials had said previously that they had no interest or intention of meeting with Pence in Pyeongchang during the games.
