(ATTN: ADDS details in paras 15-16)LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Jan. 20 (Yonhap) -- North Korea will send 22 athletes to compete in three sports at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Games in South Korea, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Saturday.
Bach said the IOC made "exceptional decisions" to ensure the participation of North Korean athletes since none qualified for the competition.
South Korea named 23 players on Thursday, and North Korea will add 12 players.
"Under our (inter-Korean) agreement, all North Korean athletes are scheduled to arrive in PyeongChang on Feb. 1," Do said.
In addition to the 1964 Games, North Korea sent athletes to the Winter Olympics in 1972, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1998, 2006 and 2010.
