Tickets for sporting competition at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang will cost from ₩20,000 (£12/$17/€15) to ₩900,000 (£552/$786/€689) and are due to go on sale in October of this year, South Korean officials announced today.

Seats for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, due to take place on February 9 and February 25 respectively, range from ₩220,000 (£135/$192/€168) to ₩1.5 million (£919/$1,310/€1,147).

Pyeongchang 2018 claim this is roughly in line with previous editions of the Winter Olympics as prices at the Ceremonies are around the same as at Vancouver 2010 but are slightly cheaper than those at Sochi 2014.

About half of the tickets for the 15 disciplines on the programme at the Games in two years’ time are due to cost around ₩80,000 (£49/$70/€61) or less, it has also been claimed, in a bid to attract as many people to the event as possible due to the lack of winter sports heritage in South Korea.

Eom Chan-wang, director general of Pyeongchang 2018’s marketing arm, said the prices were set following extensive research and surveys.

He revealed prices for sports such as biathlon and luge, which remain relatively unknown in the Asian country would be cheaper in an attempt to ensure full stadiums greet the athletes at the Games.

Prices for the men’s ice hockey final, considered one of the highlights at any Winter Games, are the most expensive and will start at ₩300,000 (£184/$262/€229), while the top seats in the Gangneung Hockey Centre will set spectators back ₩900,000 (£552/$786/€689).

Figure skating events have also been priced in a higher bracket, with tickets ranging from ₩150,000 (£92/$131/€115) to ₩800,000 (£490/$699/€612).

“The ticket price for ice hockey could be a little high, but this is the sport that has been traditionally popular," said Eom.

"There have been many inquiries from North America about ice hockey tickets, and we see no problem with selling them."

Organisers are confident of high sales following the announcement as they expect 1.17 million tickets will be issued to the public, 90 per cent of which are expected to be sold.

Around 70 per cent of those will be available to members of the public in South Korea.

If Pyeongchang 2018 reach their early target, they are set to generate ₩174 billion (£107 million/$152 million/€133 million) in revenue, it is claimed.

War veterans and people with disabilities will be entitled to up to 50 per cent discount on tickets but they are the only groups who will be able to receive cut price seats for the Games.

Ticket prices for the Games were high on the agenda at the recent International Olympic Committee (IOC) Coordination Commission visit and Pyeongchang 2018 secretary general Yeo Hyung-koo revealed the release of the costs is the result of work and discussions stretching back nearly two years.

“We have been working on ticket prices since October 2014," he said.

"We have discussed with each federation and our government before receiving final approval from the IOC.”

Tickets for the Winter Olympics will be put on sale on Pyeongchang 2018's official website in October.

Prices for the Winter Paralympic Games, which run from March 9 to 18, are due to be announced early next year, according to organisers.
