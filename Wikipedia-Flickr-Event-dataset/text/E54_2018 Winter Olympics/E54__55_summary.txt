The BBC will have the chance to sub-licence some of the rights.
The BBC’s sports portfolio has come under unprecedented pressure in recent years as pay TV broadcasters have tussled over rights.
Under the complex deal Discovery, which owns Eurosport, has dramatically seized the rights to both the summer and winter Olympics across Europe, excluding Russia, from 2018 onwards.
Unless existing legislation changes, Discovery will still have to broadcast the entire winter and summer Games free to air.
“This agreement ensures comprehensive coverage of the Olympic Games across Europe, including the guarantee to provide extensive free-to-air television coverage in all territories,” said Bach, who took over from Rogge in 2013.
