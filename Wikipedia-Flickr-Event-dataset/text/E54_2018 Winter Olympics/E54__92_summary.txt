A landmark decision to unify the Korean Peninsula under a common flag and by fielding a joint ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics in February has sparked a sharp public backlash in the South.
The symbolic gestures, agreed by North and South Korean negotiators earlier this week, during the first diplomatic talks in over two years, were intended to add to hopes of an eventual easing of international tensions over Kim Jong-un’s rapidly advancing nuclear and weapons programmes.
But the idea of marching under a flag symbolising a unified Korea has been rejected by many South Koreans who resent the perceived attempts by an undeserving North to steal the limelight at the high profile sports event.
Only four out of ten respondents said they backed the flag plan in a survey released on Thursday by the South Korean pollster Realmeter.
The lack of enthusiasm was mirrored on Friday by a plunge in the approval rating of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has vocally championed the idea of the “Peace Olympics” as a potential turning point in relations between Seoul and Pyongyang.
