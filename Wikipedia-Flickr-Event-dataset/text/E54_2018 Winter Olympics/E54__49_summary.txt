Full coverage timesNorway topped the medal table as Marit Bjorgen won gold in the women's cross-country skiing 30km mass start classic, the final event of the Winter Olympics.
It was her eighth Winter Olympic gold and puts her equal with biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen and cross country skier Bjorn Daehlie - both also from Norway - for the most in history.
"I've had an amazing day, today my skis were good and it was special, the last 100 metres by myself there and I understand that I'd win the gold medal."
If this is the last time we see Marit Bjorgen at an Olympic Games, then she is going out in style and Norway will celebrate this for days to come.
It was Parmakoski's third medal of the Games and a record finish for Finland in the mass start event.
