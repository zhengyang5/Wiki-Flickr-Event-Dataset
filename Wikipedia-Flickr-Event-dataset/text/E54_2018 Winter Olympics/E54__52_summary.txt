Discovery Communications and Eurosport have revealed an all screen editorial strategy for its coverage of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang.
VR and augmented reality will be used to engage with new and younger audiences while the channels also intend to share experiences of South Korean culture.
Discovery-owned free-to-air channels in Sweden (including Kanal 5), Norway (including TV Norge) and Germany (Eurosport 1 and DMAX) will be the exclusive Home of the Olympic Games through the Eurosport brand.
“We will offer fans something truly different, the chance to follow every local hero, every sport and every moment that matters to them.
“Offering every moment of the Olympic Games is essential given the expectation of fans and Eurosport’s commitment to live sport.
