Channel One and Match TV will show the Games despite Russia's ban.

Russian state-backed broadcasters Channel One and Match TV have confirmed they will show coverage from the 2018 winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang.

In a statement reported by the RIA Novosti news agency, Channel One said its broadcast from Pyeongchang 2018 will focus on participating Russian athletes.

Meanwhile, Match TV’s general producer Tina Kandelaki, has said the sports broadcaster will cover the opening ceremony from Pyeongchang.

In a statement on Twitter, Kandelaki wrote: “We must support the Russian athletes who go there to defend the country’s honour in conditions of an unprecedented psychological pressure.”

Pyotr Makarenko, president of the Telesport agency, said last month that Channel One and Match TV would cover the Games, along with fellow state-controlled broadcaster VGTRK.

Telesport has rights in Russia to the Olympics from 2018 to 2024 as the country was the only one omitted from Discovery Communications’ 50-territory Olympic Games European rights deal from 2018 to 2024.

In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) moved to ban Russia from competing in Pyeongchang after finding evidence of an “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of doping results surrounding the 2014 Games in Sochi.

Despite 28 lifetime bans for Russian athletes being overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), Russia’s team has been reduced to 46 athletes - still one of the biggest at the Games - competing under the ‘Olympic Athletes from Russia’ banner in Pyeongchang, using kit without national branding. The Russian anthem and flag will also not be used during medal ceremonies.
