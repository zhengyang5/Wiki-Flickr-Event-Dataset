Date 03 May 2013 Tags PyeongChang 2018 , IOC NewsPyeongChang 2018 Launches Official EmblemThe PyeongChang 2018 Organising Committee (POCOG) today launched its official Olympic emblem in front of over 1,000 guests at a gala ceremony held simultaneously in PyeongChang and in Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea.
As an athlete, part of the excitement of participating in the Games is discovering the culture and traditions of the host country, and for the PyeongChang Games, that discovery begins today with this new identity.
Combining elements of the Korean alphabet and oriental philosophy, this new brand will allow people to immediately connect with Korea and the 2018 Games vision of New Horizons.
I wish PyeongChang 2018 a great deal of success in sharing this new emblem with the world.”Celebrate in HarmonyCommission Chair Lindberg said after the ceremony, “In just under five years’ time, PyeongChang 2018 will welcome athletes and spectators from around the world to celebrate in harmony at the XXIII Olympic Winter Games.
This new emblem will now be used by PyeongChang 2018 across all its communications until the end of the Games.
