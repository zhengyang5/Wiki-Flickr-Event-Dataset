“It is so rare in an athlete’s life that you get to even compete in an Olympic Games.
(The International Olympic Committee, which along with the South Korean government spent months trying to convince North Korea to come to the Games, made exceptions so that the North could compete.)
And while North Korean athletes might well exhibit, as the head of the International Olympic Committee put it, how to “live together in peace, respect, and harmony,” their leaders have not.
The South Korean government meanwhile had secretly paid the Kim regime hundreds of millions of dollars to attend the earlier summit.
The South Korean government has also been criticized for joining the International Olympic Committee in paying the North Korean delegation’s expenses.
