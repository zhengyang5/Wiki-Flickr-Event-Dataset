The Olympic games are about excellence in sport but also about connecting people and sharing this common experience of what it means to feel the Olympic spirit.
They have included acquisitions of Voke VR for immersive sports tech; Replay Technologies for 3D video tech; providing a March Madness experience in VR; and helping provide tech for the X-Games in Aspen and the NBA All-Star Weekend.
Other tech companies that have supported the Olympics in the past with tech implementations include Facebook, NBC and many more.
Intel, which appears to be replacing McDonald’s as the primary global sponsor, is the 13th partner for the IOC, the companies said today.
Other tech companies that are currently involved with sponsoring the Olympics include Alibaba, which will be the “cloud services” and “e-commerce platform services” sponsor until 2028.
