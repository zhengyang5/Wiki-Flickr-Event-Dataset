PyeongChang is shaping up to be the most innovative Olympics ever, with advances in 8K and 5G production and an avalanche of OTT content.
Notably this includes what is believed to be the largest ever live 8K UHD production.
What’s more the 8K production features High Dynamic Range – a world first on this scale.
5G live productionThere are huge expectations around 5G as the technology moves from experimentation to commercialisation but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has stolen a march here too with what may well be the first live to air 5G video application.
The broadcaster promises more than 2,400 hours of coverage, the most ever it will have aired from a Winter Olympics.
