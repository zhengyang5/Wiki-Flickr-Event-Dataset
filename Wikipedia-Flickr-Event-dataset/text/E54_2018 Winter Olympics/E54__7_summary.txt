The International Olympic Committee filled in another blank on the Olympic map Wednesday by choosing Pyeongchang, South Korea as host of the 2018 Winter Games.
In 2007, the IOC chose Sochi for the 2014 Winter Games, giving them to winter sports power Russia for the first time.
Through 2014, just two of 22 Winter Games will have taken place in Asia, both in Japan.
Since the vote for 2014, the South Koreans dropped the heavy-handed emotional appeal that the Winter Olympics could help build a bridge to North Korea.
Germany last had the Winter Olympics in 1936 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which would have been the ski venue for 2018.
