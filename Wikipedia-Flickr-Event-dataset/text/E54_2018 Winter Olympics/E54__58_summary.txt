• Tie-up with US broadcaster keeps Olympics on BBC until at least 2024 • BBC will offer less coverage than at London 2012 but keeps live presenceThe Olympics will remain on the BBC until at least 2024 after the corporation agreed a deal with the US broadcasting giant Discovery to sub-license the rights.
Last year the BBC lost control of the future destiny of Games coverage after Discovery won the pan-European rights from 2018 onwards, and 2022 in the UK, in a £920m deal.
The new model will kick in from the 2018 Games onwards.
Discovery looked into the possibility of showing the Games exclusively on its own free-to-air channel before entering negotiations with the BBC.
“I’m delighted that through our new partnership with Discovery, the BBC will continue to carry the torch for great sporting coverage right through to the 2024 Games.
