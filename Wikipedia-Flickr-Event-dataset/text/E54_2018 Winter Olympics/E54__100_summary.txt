The North Koreans’ presence at the closing ceremony raises the possibility of a chance encounter between the North’s delegation and Ms. Trump.
He was widely believed to have helped engineer the sinking of a South Korean naval ship in 2010, which killed 46 sailors.
Still, the South Korean government said on Thursday that it would allow Mr. Kim to lead the delegation across the border.
He said he would meet the North Korean leader only if he was assured that their meeting could produce progress in helping end North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs.
In 2014, Mr. Kim, who is also a military general, led a delegation to discuss ending hostilities after North and South Korean soldiers exchanged fire across the border.
