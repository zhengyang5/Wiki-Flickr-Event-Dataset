Gold medalist Laura Dahlmeier, of Germany, skies during the women's 7.5km biathlon sprint at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Saturday, Feb. 10, 2018.
Dahlmeier, the sport's rising star, managed the conditions just fine on Saturday night, taking home gold in the women's 7.5-kilometer sprint after hitting all 10 of her targets.
"There was a lot of wind and the cold temperature, certainly not the easiest conditions," Dahlmeier said.
Silver medalist Marte Olsbu of Norway called the course "difficult" because of the wind on the shooting range.
"It's going to be a challenge," Dahlmeier said of the conditions, "but it's the same for everyone."
