Among the first to experience it will be Korea’s wild boarsThe first to experience the future of wireless technology, well before most humans, will be South Korea’s wild boars.
That’s because 5G, the fifth-generation wireless network, is making its worldwide debut at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
5G is due to be rolled out by South Korea’s wireless carriers next year.
“Wild boars are unbelievably smart animals and you need smarter gear to scare them away,” said Han Taek-sik, a KT network engineer.
The current 4G-powered system currently can’t tell wild boars from deer or humans, Han said, confusing anything approaching as a threat.
