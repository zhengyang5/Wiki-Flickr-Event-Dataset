GettyThe International Olympic Committee recently said that e-sports gaming could be a sanctioned sport for the Games.
The IOC sees allowing e-sports as a promising way to grow viewership with younger audiences.
Competitive e-sports could be part of the Olympic experience as long as it adhered to Olympic values, the International Olympic Committee said on Saturday.
Those stakeholders included international federations, national Olympic committees and athletes' representatives among others.
E-sports include competitive gaming where players square off in lucrative tournaments and draw millions of spectators online.
