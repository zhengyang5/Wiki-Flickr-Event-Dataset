Sasha “Scarlett” Hostyn made history for both women and non-Korean StarCraft pros last night by placing first in a premier tournament, IEM Pyeongchang 2018.
She’s the second North American pro to ever place first at a major StarCraft II tournament in South Korea.
The game has long had a foothold among South Korean esports pros, but clearly, the rest of the world has begun to catch up.
One other significant difference between StarCraft II and most other Olympic sports would be the lack of gender division.
By placing first in an elite tournament, Scarlett has showed the IOC that including esports should mean hosting a mixed-gender medal event.
