IOC awards SBS broadcast rights for 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024 Olympic Games

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) today awarded SBS the exclusive broadcast rights in the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for the XXIII Olympic Winter Games in 2018, the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in 2020, the XXIV Olympic Winter Games in 2022 and the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad to be celebrated in 2024, all of which have yet to be awarded to a host city.

SBS have acquired the broadcast rights across all media platforms, including free-to-air television, subscription television, internet and mobile. The agreement also includes a commitment to broadcast the Youth Olympic Games during the same period.



IOC President Jacques Rogge said, “We are delighted to continue our partnership with SBS through to 2024. SBS have been our broadcast partner in the region for many years and I would like to thank them for their commitment to the Olympic Movement.”



“This is the first broadcast agreement we have reached for the period running to 2024.” said IOC Executive Board member Richard Carrión, who led the negotiations. “This long term agreement is testament to the continuing appeal of the Olympic Games, and we are delighted that SBS will continue to provide fantastic coverage of the Games well into the next decade.”



SBS Chairman Se-Young Yoon expressed his "great pleasure to be the first broadcaster in the world to extend our contractual partnership with the IOC through 2024." He added that "SBS will gladly continue the support for the Olympic Movement overall and young Olympic athletes in particular."
