He was referring to life bans imposed by Olympic officials on four Russian cross-country skiers on Thursday.
US intelligence agencies said earlier this year the Russian government had sought to help Donald Trump win the election.
"In response to our imaginary interference in their election, [the US] wants to create problems in the Russian presidential election," he added.
Mr Putin was speaking shortly after four Russian skiers were found guilty of doping by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and banned for life from the Olympics.
