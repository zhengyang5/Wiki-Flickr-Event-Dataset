PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb. 9 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's skating star Mo Tae-bum represented every athlete in taking the "Olympic Oath" at the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics Friday, vowing fair competition and sportsmanship.

"In the name of the athletes, we promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play. We all commit ourselves to sport without doping and cheating. We do this, for the glory of sport, for the honour of our teams and in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism," he said in Korean.

Mo, who won a gold medal at the men's 500 meter speed skating at 2010 Vancouver, had the honor of representing some 3,000 athletes in their pledge of commitment to the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play.

The Olympic Oath is a solemn promise made by one athlete, judge or official, and one coach at the opening ceremony of the Olympics. Each oath taker is from the host nation and takes the oath on behalf of all athletes, officials and coaches.
