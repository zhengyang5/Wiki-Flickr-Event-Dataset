From sensor-packed ski suits and virtual reality (VR) to “bullet time” and live 4K broadcasts, the 23rd Winter Olympics from February 9 to 25 looks set to be a showcase for the very latest hyped-up tech.
Two Dutch athletes will be receiving feedback on their technique thanks to a fleet of sensors all over their bodies.
Besides, only viewers with Windows Mixed Reality, Samsung Gear VR, Google Cardboard or Google Daydream headsets can watch in VR.
KT and Intel will also be demonstrating a real-time 5G video system on the Alpensia ski slope.
TV images will be captured in 3,840 x 2,160 pixels to fit the specifications of the latest 4K TVs.
