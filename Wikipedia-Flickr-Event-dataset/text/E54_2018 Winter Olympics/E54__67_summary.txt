Comcast subsidiary NBC later confirmed that this means no 4K access through non-ISP sources, particularly NBCOlympics.com.
No matter where you watch your 4K Olympics feed, however, be warned: not every sport will be aired in 4K, and none of the 4K sports will broadcast live.
The other non-Comcast provider, Dish Network, waited until this week to confirm its 4K Olympics participation.
This delivery method, by the way, differs from Comcast's delivery of 4K content for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.
As of press time, Comcast's PR department had not definitively answered whether I had any 4K Olympics options at my current address.
