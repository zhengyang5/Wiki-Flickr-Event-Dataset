Pyeongchang, South Korea (CNN) US Vice President Mike Pence worked to deny North Korea a propaganda victory Friday, contrasting the growing excitement over Pyongyang's participation at the Olympic Games with powerful reminders of what he has called the most "tyrannical regime on the planet."
As South President Moon Jae-in prepared to host the North Korean delegation, including Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong, Pence and his wife Karen met with four North Korean defectors who shared heartbreaking stories of famine, torture and hardship.

Later Friday Pence arrived at the Olympic venue in Pyeongchang where he met with Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
At a leaders' reception ahead of the Opening Ceremony, the Vice President stopped to talk to delegates at several tables but didn't come across the North Korean delegation, according to officials traveling with him.
