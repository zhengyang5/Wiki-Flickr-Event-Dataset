WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Alex Ovechkin released a statement Thursday night through the Washington Capitals acknowledging that the ability to represent Russia in the 2018 Olympics has been taken out of his hands.
NHL players had participated in the past five Olympics, and Ovechkin played for Russia in the past three.
Ever since I was a kid and all the time I have played in the NHL, NHL players have played in the Olympic Games.
In the statement, Ovechkin thanked owner Ted Leonsis for his support.
"Our countries are now not allowed to ask us to play in the Olympics," the six-time NHL goals leader said.
