GB snowboarder Billy Morgan finished seventh in big air at this year's World Championships.
Four events are to be added to the 2018 Winter Olympics, including snowboard big air and curling mixed doubles.
In big air competitors perform a trick off a large jump and snowboarder Lesley McKenna said the addition of the event will "double" Britain's medal chances.
"We have world-class big air athletes and there is strength and depth with lots of youngsters coming through too."
Great Britain won a record-equalling four medals at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.
