Ubisoft’s open-world snowboarding game Steep will receive its first full expansion this winter. Steep: Road to the Olympics will launch Dec. 5 and feature content inspired by the 2018 Winter Olympics.

The expansion will arrive just ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Part of the new experiences available in the game include events like slalom and skicross, further diversifying the basic version of Steep’s gameplay.

Players will get to actually participate in a virtual version of next year’s Winter Olympic Games as part of the upcoming Road to the Olympics expansion. Characters sporting the iconic Olympic rings are shown throughout the trailer.

Steep: Road to the Olympics will be available on PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One when it launches in December. We were fans of the basic version of Steep, which hit those platforms back in December 2016. Check out our review for it from last winter.
