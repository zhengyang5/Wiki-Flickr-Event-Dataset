The demilitarised zone is one of the most heavily guarded areas in the worldNorth Korean athletes will be allowed to travel through the demilitarised no-go zone into South Korea as a symbolic peace gesture before next year's Winter Olympic Games, organisers have promised.
But Pyeongchang 2018 organising committee chief Hee-Beom Lee said athletes from the North would be able to arrive by road.
"Symbolically, to maintain peace in the Korean peninsula, their participation is very important, and for the success of the Olympic Games," he added.
The demilitarised zone (DMZ), established at the end of the Korean War in 1953, will mean support staff and fans will still have to travel from the North by ship.
"With or without qualification we are still talking with the International Olympic Committee and the relevant international federations for North Korea to participate," Lee told BBC Sport's Alex Capstick.
