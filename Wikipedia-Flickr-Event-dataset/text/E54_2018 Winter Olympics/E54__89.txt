In September, North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. Pyongyang tested a total of 23 missiles last year, including 15 that were nuclear-capable. The November launch of which appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, flew farther than any of Kim's previous tests. The North claimed it could reach anywhere in the mainland U.S.

Analysts say that based on the current evidence it's hard to prove or debunk North Korea's claim that it can now hit faraway American targets such as New York or Washington, D.C.

Kim's regime has yet to prove publicly that it’s able to put a small enough warhead on a missile that wouldn’t impede its flight. It’s also unclear whether North Korea has developed a vehicle capable of protecting a warhead from intense heat upon reentering the atmosphere.

However, experts say North Korea’s capabilities shouldn’t be discounted.

"Even though the ICBM technology may be somewhat incomplete, Kim is asserting that because he has a nuclear deterrent, the U.S. should not make military threats but engage with North Korea towards peaceful co-existence," said Dr. Koh Yu Whan, a professor of North Korea studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.

In Kim’s address Monday, overtures for reconciliation were not aimed at the U.S., but South Korea.

After a year in which President Donald Trump and Kim repeatedly traded jabs — largely via Twitter on Trump’s end — the young North Korean leader didn’t mention the U.S. commander in chief by name in his speech.
