Discovery Communications and Eurosport have revealed an all screen editorial strategy for its coverage of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang.

VR and augmented reality will be used to engage with new and younger audiences while the channels also intend to share experiences of South Korean culture.

Coverage will be seen on Eurosport’s pay channels and digital services in 50 markets. Discovery-owned free-to-air channels in Sweden (including Kanal 5), Norway (including TV Norge) and Germany (Eurosport 1 and DMAX) will be the exclusive Home of the Olympic Games through the Eurosport brand.

“We will offer fans something truly different, the chance to follow every local hero, every sport and every moment that matters to them. We are pleased to reveal the editorial strategy that will bring this to life, and allows us to make PyeongChang 2018 the first digital Games across Europe,” said Peter Hutton, CEO, Eurosport. “Offering every moment of the Olympic Games is essential given the expectation of fans and Eurosport’s commitment to live sport. A mark of our ambition is that we will go even further than any previous broadcaster through exclusive on-site access and a content strategy formed around the pillars of Live, Innovation, Human and Atmosphere.”

The announcement was made at the start of the FIS Alpine Ski World Championships, from where Eurosport is providing live coverage.
