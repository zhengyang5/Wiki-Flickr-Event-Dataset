As if it wasn’t already going to be a challenge, NHL participation at the 2018 Olympic Games in Pyeongchang took another blow after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) made a decision not to pay the travel and insurance costs of NHL players.
International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) president Rene Fasel told insidethegames that it’s looking less and less likely that the next Winter Games will include NHL players.
“The IOC took the decision not to pay transportation and insurance costs for NHL and NHL players to come to the next Olympic Games,” said Fasel.
[But the IOC] not covering the cost as they did at the last five Olympic Games puts us in a difficult financial situation,” said Fasel.
But he insists that the timing of the Winter Olympics, which has the NHL take a mid-season break in order to participate, makes hockey, and the NHL, a unique case.
