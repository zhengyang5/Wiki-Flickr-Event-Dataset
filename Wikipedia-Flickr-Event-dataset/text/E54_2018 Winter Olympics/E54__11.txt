The International Olympic Committee (IOC) Coordination Commission for the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games, chaired by IOC Executive Board member Gunilla Lindberg, made its first inspection of PyeongChang 2018 this week, praising the work already undertaken by local organizers.

Following the three-day inspection, Lindberg said Thursday that she found the readiness of many venues pleasing. She told a press conference, "it is a great pleasure to be back in PyeongChang. I am pleased to report that PyeongChang 2018 has made a full start as an organizing committee. We have met a very impressive team led by Kim Jin-sun. We were particularly pleased to see that the Olympic Village has already started construction".

She added, "(we viewed the report and ) it is a good Olympic concept. This is the beginning of a six-year long journey. Of course there are a lot of things to be done. But the legacy plan, venues, they have a fantastic green project; we are very impressed by it and congratulated POCOG".

The commission toured the venues in the Alpensia and Gangneung coastal clusters. Six of the sites already exist and a clear construction schedule has been established for the others, reports sportscampus.com.

The visit is the first of an expected 10 by the commission ahead of the 2018 Winter Games. The second meeting is tentatively scheduled for February 2013. Meetings will be held annually before the Sochi 2014 Winter Games and will be held twice a year until the PyeongChang Games begin.
