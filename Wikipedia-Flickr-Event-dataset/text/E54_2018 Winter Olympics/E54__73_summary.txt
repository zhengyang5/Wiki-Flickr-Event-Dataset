Seoul, South Korea — With a one letter shift from lower to upper case, the South Korean venue for the 2018 Winter Olympics, Pyeongchang, hopes to ensure visitors don’t end up flying to the capital of North Korea by mistake.
Briefing the foreign media in Seoul on Tuesday, the governor of Gangwon province, where the ski resort is located, acknowledged that the venue name was similar enough to Pyongyang to lead some winter sports fans dangerously astray.
“So, in order to avoid further confusion, we have decided to rebrand it as PyeongChang with an upper-case C,” Choi added.
The official website of the 2018 Games organising committee already bears the new PyeongChang spelling, as do a series of TV commercials airing on CNN and Eurosport.
“We hope the games will bring peace and prosperity to the whole world,” Choi said.
