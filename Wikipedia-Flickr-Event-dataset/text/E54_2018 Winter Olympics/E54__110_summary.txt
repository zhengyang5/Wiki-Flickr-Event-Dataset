The NHL will not participate in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, deciding to make the announcement now so it doesn’t overshadow the playoffs, Sportsnet has learned.
And the NHLPA has now publicly confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the Clubs.
The players declined, saying they believe they should not have to give up anything in exchange for Olympic participation.
The second question is what impact, if any, this will have on the NHL’s participation in the 2022 Beijing Games.
The Chinese government, with help from the NHL, is making major investments in hockey infrastructure leading up to the 2022 Games.
