The agreement does not include broadcast rights in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey and Britain.
Added to the earlier deals in Italy and Turkey, the IOC has reached a total of $540 million in European rights fees.
The partnership with Sportfive replaces the IOC's long-lasting rights deal with the EBU, an umbrella body of public broadcasters that had held Olympic rights for more than 50 years.
"The IOC selected Sportfive on its capacity to market the Olympic broadcast rights and its passion and commitment for the Olympic Games and the Olympic values," the IOC said in a statement.
"This agreement marks an exciting new era in the broadcasting of the Olympic Games," IOC president Jacques Rogge said.
