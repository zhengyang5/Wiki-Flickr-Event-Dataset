GB snowboarder Billy Morgan finished seventh in big air at this year's World Championships.

Four events are to be added to the 2018 Winter Olympics, including snowboard big air and curling mixed doubles.

Speed skating mass start and alpine skiing nations team events will also take place in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

The International Olympic Committee hopes the changes will provide "youth appeal" and boost female participation.

In big air competitors perform a trick off a large jump and snowboarder Lesley McKenna said the addition of the event will "double" Britain's medal chances.

"If big air becomes an Olympic sport it would be a very exciting prospect," McKenna, who competed in halfpipe in three Winter Olympics and is now GB Park and Pipe programme manager, told BBC Sport in April.

"We have world-class big air athletes and there is strength and depth with lots of youngsters coming through too."

Great Britain won a record-equalling four medals at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Half of those were provided by curling teams, who will have a chance to help Britain to an improved medal haul in 2018 with the addition of a mixed doubles event.

Lizzy Yarnold's skeleton gold, silver for the men's curlers and bronze for the women's curlers and Jenny Jones in snowboard slopestyle in 2014 matched the four medals won at the inaugural Winter Olympics in Chamonix in 1924.

Speed skating mass start involves up to 20 skaters racing around the oval at the same time.

The alpine skiing nations team event is for both men and women.
