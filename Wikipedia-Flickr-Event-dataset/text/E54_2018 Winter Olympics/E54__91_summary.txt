The games will take place between 9 and 25 February in Pyeongchang in South Korea.
South Korea's hockey coach and conservative newspapers have expressed concern about the prospect of a united hockey team, saying it could damage South Korea's chances of winning a medal.
But the liberal leader told South Korean Olympic athletes on Wednesday that the North's participation in the Games would help improve inter-Korean relations.
However, the Olympic detente does not alter the realities of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome.
