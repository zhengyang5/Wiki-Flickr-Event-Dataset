Russian athletes have been muzzled under orders from the IOC not to be outspoken about the ban, and among the Russian athletes' conditions is to refrain from posting national symbols and messages on social media.

Russian athletes were stripped of more than a dozen medals because of the doping allegations after Sochi, although nine were later reinstated.
