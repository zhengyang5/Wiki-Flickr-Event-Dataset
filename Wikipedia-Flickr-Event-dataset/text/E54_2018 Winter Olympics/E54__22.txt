Ticket sales for next month's Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang have risen slightly to 69.7 per cent with less than three weeks to go until the Opening Ceremony.

This percentage, which was published by the Organising Committee, includes local and international sales and a total of 744,822 tickets.

A much improved total of 70.4 per cent, or 154,952 out of 223,353 available tickets, have been sold for the Paralympics, Pyeongchang 2018 claim.

For the Olympics, 82.3 per cent of tickets have now been sold for Alpine skiing along with 80.3 per cent for bobsleigh and 81.8 per cent for short-track speed skating.

At the other end of the scale, only 59.4 per cent have been sold for biathlon and 52.5 per cent for Nordic combined.

Many tickets also remain available for figure skating, with just 62.4 per cent sold so far.

At the Paralympics, snow events have surprisingly proved most popular in terms of percentages sold.

A total of 95.5 per cent of available tickets have been sold for Alpine skiing along with 94.3 for biathlon and 95.7 per cent for Para Snowboard.

Only 44.1 per cent have been sold for the Opening Ceremony and just 19.5 per cent for the Closing Ceremony.

The Paralympic sales, if correct, nonetheless represent a huge improvement since sales figures of just 0.2 per cent for the Winter Paralympics were recorded in early October.

Sales for both events have risen since the start of the Olympic Torch Relay in November.

The Pyeongchang 2018 Olympics are scheduled to take place from February 9 to 25.

They will be followed by the Paralympics, due to be held from March 8 to 18.
