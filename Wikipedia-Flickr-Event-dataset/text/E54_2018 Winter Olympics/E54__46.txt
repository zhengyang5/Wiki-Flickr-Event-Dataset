It had been done in the summer, by legends such as Michael Phelps and Carl Lewis. It had been done in the pool and on the track. But never on ice. And never in the winter.

Until now.

Ireen Wust, the legendary Dutch speed skater who debuted at the Olympics as a teenager in 2006, took gold in the women’s 1,500-meter on Monday. In doing so, she became the first Winter Olympian to win individual gold medals at four consecutive Games.

Wust, 31, beat out Japan’s Miho Takagi by 0.20 seconds at the Gangneung Oval, 12 years after winning the 3,000m event in Turin as a 19-year-old. She won the 1,500m in Vancouver in 2010, and the 3,000m in Sochi in 2014.

Monday’s gold was Wust’s 10th medal in all, and fifth gold. She was part of the Netherlands team that won the team pursuit final in Sochi in 2014. She won three silvers four years ago as well.

Past Winter Olympians have come close to the record. Norwegian cross-country skier Ole Einar Bjorndalen won golds at four different Games, but not consecutive Games. And his 2010 gold came in a relay.

German speed skater Claudia Pechstein won gold medals in four consecutive Olympics, from 1994-2006, but her final gold, her only one in 2006, came in team pursuit. (Pechstein was also accused of blood doping and banned from skating for two years.)

Wust is now the most successful speed skater ever, and was already the most successful Dutch Olympian of all time. Now she has a unique Winter Olympic record to her name, regardless of sport.

And Wust could still add to her medal ledger. She has the 1,000m event upcoming on Wednesday, and is part of the Netherlands team pursuit lineup that will hit the skating track next week.
