Charles Pic and Daniel Juncadella will both drive during the first practice session of this weekend's Formula 1 Gran Premio d'Italia 2014, for Lotus and Force India respectively.



Juncadella, Force India's reserve driver and a regular for Mercedes in Germany's DTM series, will contest the opening 30 minutes of FP1 in a VJM07 before handing the car back to Sergio Perez for the rest of the weekend.



The Spaniard previously stood in for Nico Hulkenberg in FP1 at Silverstone earlier this season.



Pic, meanwhile, will take over Romain Grosjean's cockpit for the entirety of the first session, before his compatriot takes over the Lotus E22 from FP2 onwards.



The Frenchman has tested twice for Lotus this year, but it will be his first time driving for the team on a Grand Prix weekend.



Pic joined the Enstone-based squad as their third driver at the start of this season, having previously competed for Marussia in 2012 - his debut season - and Caterham last year.



Alongside Pic and Juncadella, Sauber test and reserve driver Giedo van der Garde will contest FP1 in place of Adrian Sutil, while across at Caterham Roberto Merhi will make his Formula One debut in FP1 before handing over to the returning Kamui Kobayashi.
