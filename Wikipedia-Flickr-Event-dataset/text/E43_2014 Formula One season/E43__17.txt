Daniel Juncadella has secured a test and reserve deal with the Force India team for the 2014 Formula 1 season.

The 2012 European Formula 3 champion will dovetail the role, which will include some Friday practice outings at grands prix, with continuing to race in the DTM for Force India's F1 engine supplier Mercedes.

"It's a fantastic opportunity for me to learn and will hopefully take me a step closer to eventually racing in Formula 1," said Juncadella.

Team boss Vijay Mallya said the 22-year-old Spaniard's deal continued Force India's tradition of bringing young drivers into F1.

"Over the last few years we have always tried to support young, talented drivers and we will continue down this path by giving Daniel the opportunity to drive the VJM07 on Friday mornings at selected races," said Mallya.

"Daniel will also play an important role in our simulator programme at the factory, which remains an increasingly important development tool."

Juncadella won the 2011 Macau F3 GP before taking the following year's European title, after which his ties with Mercedes brought him into the DTM.

He already has some F1 testing experience with Ferrari and Williams.
