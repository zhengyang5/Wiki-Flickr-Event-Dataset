Pirelli and the Formula One teams have agreed which days will be given over to testing new tyre developments during the season.
A plan for teams to assist F1’s official tyre supplier with testing during the season was reached following the row last year over Mercedes and Ferrari conducting private tests for Pirelli.
The tyre testing will take place within the existing in-season tests.
At the final in-season test in Abu Dhabi all teams will be given prototype 2015 tyres for testing.
