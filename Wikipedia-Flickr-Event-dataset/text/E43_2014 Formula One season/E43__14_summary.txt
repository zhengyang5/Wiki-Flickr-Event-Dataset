The new deal means Mercedes will supply Force India with power units and KERS under the new regulations that will come into play from next year, when turbo engines will return to F1.
Force India said the expansion of the agreement will include the supply of the gearbox and hydraulic systems.
"Force India was our first genuine customer in F1 back in 2009 and we are delighted to enter an expanded, long-term relationship with them from 2014 onwards.
"This long-term agreement offers excellent value in terms of the balance between price and performance.
"We hope it will mean Mercedes-Benz and Force India working together for the entire life cycle of the new powertrain generation."
