The final 50mm of the nose must be lower than 185mm from the carâ€™s floor (this is called the reference plane).
The high chassis cars mean that front wishbones need to be sloped up to the car, which compromises weight transfer.
The changes to the rear wing are more substantial as the beam wing has been eliminated.
In addition the rear wing is attached to the bodywork with a hoop, again to try to divert airflow over the diffuser.
The rear wing itself is fairly standard although the endplates have gained a couple of vertical slots towards the front.
