Andre Lotterer will make a surprise Formula One debut in this weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix.
The German driver, who scored his third victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours for Audi earlier this year, will drive for Caterham in place of Kamui Kobayashi.
In a statement on Wednesday the team said it “will benefit from having another experienced driver at the wheel of the car throughout the weekend and the German’s feedback will contribute to improve the performance of the car”.
Caterham said the swap is for this race only and Kobayashi “still remains part of the team”.
