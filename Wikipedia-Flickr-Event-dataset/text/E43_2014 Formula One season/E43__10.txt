Caterham's reserve driver Alexander Rossi will get his first taste of the team's 2014 Formula 1 car during first practice runs in the Canadian and United States Grands Prix.

The American has had regular outings for the team since first linking up with it in 2011, but his runs in FP1 in Montreal and Austin will be his first opportunity to try out this year's car.

While Rossi is focusing his efforts on GP2 this season, Caterham is giving him the outings as it continues preparations to try to move him up to a full-time role in F1.

"While his focus this year is firmly on GP2, we are pleased to give him more opportunities to play an active role in the F1 team's race weekends and to have him help us develop our car at two races that are very important for us," said team principal Cyril Abiteboul.

Rossi added: "Each time I step into F1 machinery there is an important job to do.

"Montreal and Austin are important races for me and I want to thank Caterham for the opportunity to continue my development to a full time race seat in F1."
