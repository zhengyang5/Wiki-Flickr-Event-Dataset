Bahrain will celebrate the tenth anniversary of its first Grand Prix this year by becoming the latest Formula One night race.
The 2014 Bahrain race, which takes place on April 6, will start at 1800 hours local time (1500 hours GMT) and, like the Singapore Grand Prix, will be held entirely in floodlit conditions.
The Sakhir circuit, where floodlights were erected last year, becomes the third venue to hold all or part of a Grand Prix in the hours of darkness.
Singapore has hosted a night race since 2008, whilst Abu Dhabi has staged a race starting at twilight since 2009.
