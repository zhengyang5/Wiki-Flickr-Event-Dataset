A visit to AMG Mercedes High Performance Powertrains (HPP) in Brixworth today yielded some fascinating insights into how F1 is set to change and what fans will see next season.
And we got the chance to see one of the new generation V6 turbo engines on the dyne and to hear its sound.
But through the upshifts and downshifts it sounds very much like an F1 engine and there is a sweetness to the sound which is distinctively F1.
Getting on top of that will be important, but so will the efficiency of the power units themselves.
One important aspect of change will be to see the power unit as a whole entity, so that each driver will have 5 power units for the season (currently he has 8 engines).
