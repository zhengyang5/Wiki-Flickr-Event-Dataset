Formula One: Indian Grand Prix under threat due to tax dispute with teamsLAT Photographic - Mercedes' driver Michael Schumacher signs an Indian flag during the Malaysian Grand Prix.
The inaugural Indian Grand Prix could be under threat because of a dispute between the Formula One teams and the country's tax authorities--and the issue is so serious that the teams say they can't go to Delhi for the Oct. 30 event unless the issue is resolved.
The Indian government wants to claim what it believes are its share of the annual incomes of the 12 teams.
“It's a serious issue, and it needs to be resolved,” Formula One Teams Association frontman Martin Whitmarsh told Autoweek.
All of the financial directors within FOTA [Formula One Teams Association] are working together and are very concerned about it.
