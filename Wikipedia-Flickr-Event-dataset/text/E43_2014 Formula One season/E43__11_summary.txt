Ferrari have confirmed their new F1 car will be called the F14 T following a poll on its website.
The name was chosen by 32.9% of the 1.1 million fans who voted in the poll.
The runner-up choice of F166 Turbo attracted 31.2% of the vote, with the rest split between F14 Scuderia, F14 Maranello and F616.
The Ferrari F14 T is set to be launched tomorrow.
It will be the team’s first car powered by a V6 turbo engine since the F1/87-88C used in the 1988 season.
