The Grand Prix of America is due to be held on 3.2 miles of public road in Port Imperial, a district in the New Jersey towns of West New York and Weehawken.
It has been dropped from the provisional F1 calendar twice, has had multiple management changes and has breached its contract, according to Ecclestone.
The F1 Group itself provided a loan of $10m and this gave Ecclestone a good insight into the organizers' finances.
The last grand prix to be held at Magny-Cours, which is located in Nevers, central France, was in 2008.
"The championship is in good shape," Ecclestone said, adding that he is looking forward to this year's new addition which is the inaugural Russian Grand Prix.
