Jules Bianchi will remain with Marussia for a second season in 2014, the team announced on Thursday morning.

The Frenchman made his debut for the outfit at the start of this year but Ferrari, which has supported his career, was considering moving him to Sauber.

However, Marussia's switch to Ferrari engines and its progress on track has ensured it will retain Bianchi for at least another campaign.

"I couldn't have wished for a more supportive environment in which to make my F1 debut and from the very beginning I have always felt completely at home with the team," said Bianchi, whose best finish is 13th in the Malaysian Grand Prix.

"We started the season very well and, while the challenge has increased as the season has developed, we have learned important lessons together that will place us in a much stronger position next year when there are a lot of changes for the sport and the team to get used to.

"I am very excited to be part of the team as we all enter this new era of F1 and I look forward to achieving some rewarding performances together."

Bianchi's decision to remain at Marussia is a huge sign of confidence in the team from both the driver and Ferrari ahead of the challenges posed by new regulations in 2014.

Marussia team principal John Booth welcomed the fact that his team would have stability on the driver front.

"2014 heralds a new era for the sport and continuity and consistency of line-up will be important in helping us to navigate the transition," he said.

Bianchi's team-mate Max Chilton is in negotiations with the team to stay on board as well for 2014, with an announcement about Marussia's second driver plans expected later this season.
