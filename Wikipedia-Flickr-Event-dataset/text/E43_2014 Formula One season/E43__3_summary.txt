PARIS (AFP) - Formula One was in mourning Saturday for Jules Bianchi, the French driver who died from head injuries he suffered in a crash at last season’s Japanese Grand Prix, after spending nine months in a coma.
He is the first Formula One driver to perish from a racing accident since triple world champion Aryton Senna in San Marino in 1994.
“French motorsport has lost one of its greatest hopes,” French President Francois Hollande commented in a statement.
Formula One supremo and the sport’s chief executive Bernie Ecclestone stated: “It was so sad to hear the news about Jules.
His grandfather Mauro had been a well known Formula Three and endurance driver in the 1960s.
