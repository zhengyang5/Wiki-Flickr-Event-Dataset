McLaren have confirmed their title sponsorship arrangement with Vodafone will conclude at the end of this year.
The team said Vodafone “has decided to focus on business priorities away from Formula One sponsorship”.
McLaren added it would not confirm the identity of its new title sponsor but “will make an exciting announcement on 2nd December 2013, following the last Grand Prix of the season”.
“We’re immensely proud that, having been set a number of ambitious challenges by Vodafone back in 2007, together we’ve met or exceeded each and every one,” said team principal Martin Whitmarsh.
“Our focus is on continuing to drive results for all our partners throughout the 2013 season and we look forward to making a major title partnership announcement towards the end of the year.”Vodafone has been McLaren’s title sponsor since 2007 (pictured).
