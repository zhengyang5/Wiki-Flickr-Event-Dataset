Will Stevens will start his first Formula One race this weekend in Abu Dhabi.
The 23-year-old, who won two races in Formula Renault 3.5 this year, will partner Kamui Kobayashi at Caterham.
The team signed Stevens last week but had to wait until today for his super licence to be confirmed.
“I’m absolutely thrilled to be getting this opportunity and am very grateful to everyone involved at Caterham F1 Team for giving it to me,” said Stevens.
Stevens’ most recent race victory came in the penultimate round of the Formula Renault 3.5 championship at Jerez.
