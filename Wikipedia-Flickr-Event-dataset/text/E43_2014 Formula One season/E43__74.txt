The introduction of a penalty points system which could see drivers being excluded from races has moved a step closer.

Team principals have agreed on a structure for the points system according to Auto Motor und Sport. The plan received the support of seven of the eleven team principals and will now be considered for implementation by the FIA.

Under the plan drivers would receive penalty points for a range of misdemeanours. They continue to accrue them until they reach at least 12, at which time they receive a race ban.

The following misdemeanours would incur the following points penalties:

Infraction Points Race ban 5 Exceeded the speed limit (at any time) by more than 20kph 3 Caused a dangerous collision 3 Ignored the black flag 3 Exceeded the speed limit (at any time) by 10-20kph 2 Caused a collision 2 Dangerously impeded another driver 2 Dangerously forced another driver off the track 2 Drove too quickly in a yellow or red flag situation 2 Ignored the blue flag 2 False start 2 Overtook the Safety Car 2 Exceeded the Safety Car delta time 2 Dangerous exit from a pit stop 2 Ignored the weigh station during qualifying 2 Missed the drivers’ briefing or arrived late 1 Exceeded the speed limit (at any time) by up to 10kph 1 Impeded another driver 1 Forced another driver off the track 1 Gained an advantage by leaving the track 1 Crossed the white line at the pit lane exit 1 Ignored the red light at the pit lane exit 1 Overtook another car under the Safety Car 1 Failed to maintain correct distance to the Safety Car 1

Existing penalties will remain in place so a driver who was given a grid drop for impeding a driver would also receive the corresponding penalty points.
