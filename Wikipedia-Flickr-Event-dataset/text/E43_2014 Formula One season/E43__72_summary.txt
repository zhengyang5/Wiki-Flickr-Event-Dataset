Pirelli will continue as the sole tyre supplier to Formula 1 after agreeing a three-year contract extension with the FIA.
In a bid to eradicate the tyre delamination issues which plagued 2013, Formula One has granted Pirelli exclusive test days to evaluate its wet weather tyres ahead of the new season.
The teams will also have to give up one of their eight in season test days for exclusive Pirelli tyre testing to aid the development of its product.
Pirelli returned as the official tyre supplier to Formula One in 2010 and the new deal will see them in the sport until the end of 2016.
The 2014 Formula One season begins with the Australian Grand Prix at Melbourneâ€™s Albert Park from March 14-16.
