FIA stewards will be lenient with regards to cars qualifying outside of the 107 percent rule, ensuring a full 22-car grid is likely to start the Rolex Australian Grand Prix.
Race director Charlie Whiting held his annual press conference to clarify the 2014 rules, where he revealed stewards will be more sympathetic with regards to the 107 percent ruling.
Previously cars that had qualified outside of the ruling were only allowed to start the race if they had shown enough pace in practice.
“What we have out here are 11 teams who we know are capable, but they may be suffering a temporary performance loss.
“I am sure the stewards will look very sympathetically on any team that does not make the 107 percent.
