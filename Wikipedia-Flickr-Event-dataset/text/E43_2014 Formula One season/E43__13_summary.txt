Spanish driver Fernando Alonso has signed a new deal with Ferrari that will keep him with the Italian team until the end of the 2016 season.
In signing such a lengthy deal, Alonso is convinced he will now remain with Ferrari for the rest of his F1 career.
"The intention is to finish my career with Ferrari and I can't imagine a better place to race," added Alonso.
Maybe in 2017 we can do another contract if I'm still quick and Ferrari are still happy with me.
Vettel pipped Alonso to last year's title, in what was an eventful debut Ferrari season for the Spaniard.
