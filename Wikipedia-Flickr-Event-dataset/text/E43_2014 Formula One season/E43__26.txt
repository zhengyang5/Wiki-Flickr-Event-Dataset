McLaren is to unveil its 2014 Formula 1 car with an online launch on January 24, four days before the first test begins at Jerez.

Although a majority of teams are expected to wait until arriving in Spain before launching their cars, McLaren has opted to go public beforehand.

The team announced on Tuesday that it will hold a digital-only launch at midday on Friday January 24 to reveal its new MP4-29.

The Woking-based outfit hopes that the new car will help it return to the front of the grid, following a disappointing 2013 campaign where it failed to secure a podium finish.

Mercedes is the only other team to have announced its launch plans, with the team set to roll out its W05 at Jerez on January 28.
