Bernie Ecclestone has agreed to give Caterham a dispensation to miss the next two rounds of the championship while the administrators who own the team try to find a buyer for it.
This means they are now able to sell Caterham’s F1 racing operation and championship entry as a going concern if a buyer can be found.
Shinners said “Purchasing the assets would give the buyer ready access to F1 racing”.
Caterham can miss next week’s round in the USA and the race which takes place on the following weekend in Brazil.
O’Connell said the arrangement “gives us a much better chance of being able to reach a better conclusion for the racing team and its creditors”.
