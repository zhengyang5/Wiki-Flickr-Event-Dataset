Daniel Ricciardo: Appeal rejectedThe FIA have rejected Red Bull's appeal against the disqualification of Daniel Ricciardo from the Australian GP.
However, in a statement released on Tuesday, Red Bull said they accepted the decision.
"We are frankly concerned that Red Bull have shown such a flagrant and deliberate disregard for the rules," said Harris.
Reinstatement would have propelled Red Bull into second place in the Constructors' Championship, 58 points behind runaway leaders Mercedes, ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai.
