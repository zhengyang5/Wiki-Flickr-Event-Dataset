Pirelli and the Formula One teams have agreed which days will be given over to testing new tyre developments during the season.

A plan for teams to assist F1’s official tyre supplier with testing during the season was reached following the row last year over Mercedes and Ferrari conducting private tests for Pirelli.

The tyre testing will take place within the existing in-season tests. Each team will devote one of its two days at one of the tests to conducting tyre development work for Pirelli:

Date Track Pirelli test teams 8th April Bahrian International Circuit Caterham 9th April Bahrian International Circuit Mercedes and Williams 13th May Circuit de Catalunya Sauber and Toro Rosso 14th May Circuit de Catalunya McLaren and Force India 8th July Silverstone Ferrari and Lotus 9th July Silverstone Red Bull and Marussia 25th November Yas Marina 26th November Yas Marina

The tyres each team will use during its nominated Pirelli tyre test days will not form part of the 135 sets which they are given for testing purposes each year under the rules.

At the final in-season test in Abu Dhabi all teams will be given prototype 2015 tyres for testing.
