Following meetings in Sochi resulting from Jules Bianchiâ€™s horrific accident in Suzuka, the FIA and the F1 teams are to trial a new system for controlling the speed of the cars in yellow flag caution zones during practice at the next race in Austin, Texas.
The approach agreed for this test is the same way that the FIA together with the F1 teams developed the Safety Car delta speed system.
This test will be similar and there will be a delta time to establish through the Yellow Flag sector.
Drivers have been in the habit of lifting as little as possible in yellow flag zones in the past, barely a second of throttle lift.
In Suzuka Bianchi was racing against Marcus Ericsson behind, who had taken on a set of new wet tyres four laps earlier and was lapping 1.2 seconds per lap faster than Bianchi.
