A lot of folk have asked about what manufacturers can and cannot do to improve their engines for 2015.
To achieve this the regulators came up with the idea of dividing the parts of F1 power units into three categories, ranked 1, 2 and 3.
The total ranking for the parts in an F1 power unit is 66.
From this total was derived a system of “tokens” that allow for change.
As a result, over time the engines should become more closely-matched.
