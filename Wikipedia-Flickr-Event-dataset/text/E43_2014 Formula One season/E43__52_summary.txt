Marussia will not compete in this weekend’s United States Grand Prix, administrators representing the team have confirmed.
However the team will continue to operate while Geoff Rowley and Geoff Carton-Kelly, the team’s appointed administrators at FRP Advisory, assess the company’s viability.
The team’s staff, which number almost 200, have been in full up to the end of October and no redundancies have been made since Marussia went into administration, according to FRP.
“The company has ceased trading while the joint administrators assess the longer term viability of the company in its present form.
