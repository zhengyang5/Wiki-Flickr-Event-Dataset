If a driver accumulates more than 12 points he will be banned from the next race.
The amount of points a driver may be given for infringements will vary from one to three depending upon the severity of the offence.
Track testing will now also be permitted in January 2014 in order to allow earlier testing of the new power units.
It is agreed that only five power units may be used by each driver for the whole season.
Any changes of individual elements above the permitted five, such as turbocharger, MGU or Energy Store, will result in a 10 grid place penalty.
