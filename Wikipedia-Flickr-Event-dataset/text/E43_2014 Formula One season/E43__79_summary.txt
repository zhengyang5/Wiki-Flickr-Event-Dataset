The FIA has confirmed further changes to qualifying ahead of the first race of the season.
Updated Sporting Regulations published by the FIA today include a series of changes intended to encourage drivers who reach the final stage of qualifying to set a time.
Any driver who reaches Q3 must now start the race on the set of tyres which he set his fastest time with in Q2.
Those who reach Q3 may only use it in that part of qualifying, and those who do not reach Q3 may only use them during the race.
Q3 has been extended by two minutes to 12 and Q1 shortened by a corresponding amount, in order to give drivers more time to set laps in Q3.
