Sauber: Will continue to run with Ferrari power

Aside from the four years when they were owned by BMW, the Hinwil-based team have run Ferrari engines since 1997, when they were initially badged Petronas, and an extension of that relationship for 2014 had been considered a formality.

Sauber duly announced at the Korean GP on Friday that their relationship with Ferrari would be continuing into next season and beyond with the extended deal including a supply of the Scuderia's complete powertrain, including engine, gearbox and new Energy Recovery Systems (ERS).

"We are pleased to extend our technical partnership with Ferrari taking Sauber into the new era of engines that starts in 2014," Sauber Team Principal Monisha Kaltenborn said.

"Ferrari has been a long standing partner of the team, first from 1997 to 2005 and then again from 2010 onwards. We are proud to extend our relationship with such a prestigious and renowned brand and look forward to entering the 2014 season with a strong and reliable partner like Ferrari."

The announcement means that, alongside their own team and new customers Marussia, Ferrari will build engines for three outfits in 2014.

Third practice and qualifying for the Korean GP is live on Sky Sports F1 on Saturday morning from 2.45am with Sunday's race build-up starting at 5.30am.
