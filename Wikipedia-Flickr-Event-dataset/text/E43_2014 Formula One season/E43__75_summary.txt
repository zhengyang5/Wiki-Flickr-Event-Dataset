The FIA has ratified a plan to introduce a penalty points system in F1 from next year.
Drivers will accrue penalty points for a range of transgressions and if they accumulate at least 12 they will be banned from one race.
Depending on the severity of the offence committed, drivers will be given one, two or three penalty points.
The FIA has introduced two rules changes aimed at improving safety in the pit lane.
Several rules changes have been implemented to account for the forthcoming change in engine regulations.
