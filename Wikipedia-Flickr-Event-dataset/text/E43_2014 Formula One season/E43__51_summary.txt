By Alan BaldwinLONDON (Reuters) - The struggling Caterham and Marussia Formula One teams will both miss next week's U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, the sport's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone told Reuters on Saturday.
Caterham went into administration on Friday while Russian-registered Marussia are also struggling financially and are still reeling from French driver Jules Bianchi's serious accident in Japan three weeks ago.
The air transport for all the teams' cars and freight is organised by Ecclestone's Formula One Management and they were due to be flown out on Saturday.
It will stay in the UK and hopefully if Caterham races in one of the last races we will ship the racing kit from here," he said.
Ecclestone said on Friday that Caterham had been given a dispensation to miss the next two races while they sought a buyer.
