The American has had regular outings for the team since first linking up with it in 2011, but his runs in FP1 in Montreal and Austin will be his first opportunity to try out this year's car.
While Rossi is focusing his efforts on GP2 this season, Caterham is giving him the outings as it continues preparations to try to move him up to a full-time role in F1.
Rossi added: "Each time I step into F1 machinery there is an important job to do.
"Montreal and Austin are important races for me and I want to thank Caterham for the opportunity to continue my development to a full time race seat in F1."
