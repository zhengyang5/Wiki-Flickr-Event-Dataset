Renault have unveiled images and details of their 2014 Formula One engine.
In 2014 the current 2.4-litre V8 engines, which rev to a maximum of 18,000rpm, will be replaced by 1.6-litre V6 turbocharged power units revving to a maximum of 15,000rpm.
Fundamentally the engine noise will still be loud.
The engine noise is just a turbocharged noise rather than a normally-aspirated noise: you can just hear the turbo when the driver lifts off the throttle and the engine speed drops.
