Sauber has revealed that its 2014 chassis has been homologated by the FIA after completing a series of crash tests.

The team revealed on Twitter that the Sauber C33 had "passed all static and dynamic tests of the FIA and is officially homologated". Most teams are expected to complete similar crash tests in the coming weeks, with the new Caterham reportedly passing its over the Brazilian Grand Prix weekend.

Sauber added "the rear crash test, which is not part of the chassis homologation, will take place separately at a later date, as usual".

The first pre-season test of 2014 is set to take place in the last week of January.
