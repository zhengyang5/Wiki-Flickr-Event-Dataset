Lotus will not have their 2014 car ready for the first test of the year at Jerez.
With the first test of 2014 due to being three weeks from tomorrow, Lotus have become the first team to confirm their new contender will not be ready in time.
“We?������re going to keep our car under wraps a little longer than some other teams,” said technical director Nick Chester.
“We?������ve decided that attending the Jerez test isn?������t ideal for our build and development programme.”Chester added the team intends to have the E22 ready for the second test of 2014 which begins on February 19th.
The new car is yet to pass all of the FIA’s mandatory crash tests, Chester added.
