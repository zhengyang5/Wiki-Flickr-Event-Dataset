However, Marussia's switch to Ferrari engines and its progress on track has ensured it will retain Bianchi for at least another campaign.
Bianchi's decision to remain at Marussia is a huge sign of confidence in the team from both the driver and Ferrari ahead of the challenges posed by new regulations in 2014.
Marussia team principal John Booth welcomed the fact that his team would have stability on the driver front.
Bianchi's team-mate Max Chilton is in negotiations with the team to stay on board as well for 2014, with an announcement about Marussia's second driver plans expected later this season.
