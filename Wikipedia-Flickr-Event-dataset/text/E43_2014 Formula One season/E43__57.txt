Formula One: Indian Grand Prix under threat due to tax dispute with teams



LAT Photographic - Mercedes' driver Michael Schumacher signs an Indian flag during the Malaysian Grand Prix.

The inaugural Indian Grand Prix could be under threat because of a dispute between the Formula One teams and the country's tax authorities--and the issue is so serious that the teams say they can't go to Delhi for the Oct. 30 event unless the issue is resolved.

Driver earnings are also under dispute, and while they face issues in a number of countries, the teams as such are not usually involved in tax situations.

The Indian government wants to claim what it believes are its share of the annual incomes of the 12 teams. Team directors will apparently be held personally responsible for ensuring that any requested taxes are paid.

“It's a serious issue, and it needs to be resolved,” Formula One Teams Association frontman Martin Whitmarsh told Autoweek. “And the teams need to receive the appropriate reassurance to be able to go to India.

“There is a significant worry and concern among the teams, and it needs to be resolved. I am sure it will be, but if it weren't to be resolved, then it would threaten the race, wouldn't it?

“It's an issue of withholding tax. It's not an unfamiliar one. There are tax treaties between countries, and it's an extraordinarily complex matter. All of the financial directors within FOTA [Formula One Teams Association] are working together and are very concerned about it. We've employed Ernst & Young as consultants to help find a solution, and hopefully we will.”
