Pirelli will continue as the sole tyre supplier to Formula 1 after agreeing a three-year contract extension with the FIA.

The Italian tyre manufacturer endured a turbulent season last year, highlighted by a significant number of high profile failures, which forced the firm to make radical changes to its tyres.

Despite a difficult 2013 campaign a new three-year contract extension has been agreed.

The new arrangement, however, hinged on changes being made to F1’s sporting regulations regarding the sport’s strict testing limitations.

In a bid to eradicate the tyre delamination issues which plagued 2013, Formula One has granted Pirelli exclusive test days to evaluate its wet weather tyres ahead of the new season.

The teams will also have to give up one of their eight in season test days for exclusive Pirelli tyre testing to aid the development of its product.

“Pirelli will continue to determine the specification of the tyres and to manage all aspects of their development, in close consultation with the FIA and the teams, and within the parameters set out in the FIA Formula One Sporting and Technical Regulations,” the tyre company said in a statement.

Pirelli returned as the official tyre supplier to Formula One in 2010 and the new deal will see them in the sport until the end of 2016.

The 2014 Formula One season begins with the Australian Grand Prix at Melbourne’s Albert Park from March 14-16.
