Sergio Perez will race for Force India during the 2014 Formula 1 season, with the team unveiling the Mexican in London on Thursday.
Despite the late nature of that call, Perez was confident he would be on the grid next year and has been regularly linked to the vacant second Force India seat.
AUTOSPORT understands Perez brings a commercial package believed to be worth around 15 million euro.
"It's great to announce my new team as Force India," said Perez.
2013 Force India drivers Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta will therefore both need to move on if they are to stay in F1.
