Newey reveals that 2014 Red Bull RB10 is uglyRed Bull designer Adrian Newey has admitted the new RB10 he is penning for the 2014 season is ugly.
“The new Red Bull is ugly.
He said he is working on the RB10 for “four of the five days” of the working week.
He said the reason for the ‘ugly’ 2014 car is because of the new aerodynamic rules, sending designers down the path of penning a “hook nose”.
But the bigger concern for Formula 1’s technical boffins is the new powertrain rules, which Newey said are “more complex than ever before”.
