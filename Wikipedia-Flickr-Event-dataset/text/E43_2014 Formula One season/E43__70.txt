Formula One teams will be allowed to test during the F1 season once more from next year, the FIA has confirmed.

The World Motor Sport Council approved plans for teams to conduct four tests during the 2014 season.

“Four two-day track tests will be allowed in season in place of the current eight one-day promotional days and the three-day young driver test,” said a statement from the FIA.

“These will take place at tracks in Europe on the Tuesday and Wednesday after a race in order to ensure minimal additional resources are necessary.”

Teams will also be allowed to begin pre-season testing earlier, in January, to give them more time to develop the new 1.6-litre V6 engines which are being introduced next year.

The FIA also announced “a significant reduction in the amount of wind tunnel testing and CFD work has been imposed to help reduce costs and potentially allow two teams to share one wind tunnel”.
