The deal is part of a wider technical partnership, which includes the team being supplied with gearboxes and related systems.
Marussia has used Cosworth engines since joining the F1 grid at the start of the 2010 season.
Despite this new technical partnership with Ferrari, Marussia will continue to have a similar deal with McLaren.
The McLaren technical partnership involves the use of aerodynamic facilities such as the windtunnel, so will not conflict with the Ferrari powertrain deal.
Allied to the ongoing McLaren technical partnership, which is particularly helpful in terms of aerodynamic development tools, Marussia is a well-run, compact and efficient F1 team.
