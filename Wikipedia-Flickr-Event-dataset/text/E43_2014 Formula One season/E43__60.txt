The 2014 Bahrain Grand Prix will be staged under floodlights

The previous nine incarnations of the race have been run at 3pm local time, meaning the midday sun is avoided and allowing a traditional European timeslot of 1pm UK time.

However, for the 2014, the race on 6th April will be pushed back to the twilight hours - similar to event in neighbouring Abu Dhabi.

"I think they are going to call it a twilight race," McLaren Team Principal Martin Whitmarsh commented.

"I've seen pictures of all the floodlights on it, so for their 10th anniversary they've got floodlights."

The news comes after confirmation that two of next seasons pre-season tests will be staged at the Bahrain International Circuit.
