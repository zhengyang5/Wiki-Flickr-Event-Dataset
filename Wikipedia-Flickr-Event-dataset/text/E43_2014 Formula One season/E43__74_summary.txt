The introduction of a penalty points system which could see drivers being excluded from races has moved a step closer.
Team principals have agreed on a structure for the points system according to Auto Motor und Sport.
The plan received the support of seven of the eleven team principals and will now be considered for implementation by the FIA.
Under the plan drivers would receive penalty points for a range of misdemeanours.
They continue to accrue them until they reach at least 12, at which time they receive a race ban.
