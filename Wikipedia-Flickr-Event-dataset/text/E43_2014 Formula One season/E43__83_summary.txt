Red Bull Racing has been disqualified from the Australian Grand Prix after it was found in post race inspection that the RB10 driven to second place by Daniel Ricciardo broke the new fuel flow rate rule.
It is this second part the, flow rate which Red Bull exceeded.
After qualifying the FIAâ€™s technical representative in charge of the flow meters instructed Red Bull to apply an offset to their fuel flow such that the fuel flow would have been legal.
Red Bull then told the stewards that based on the difference observed between the two readings in FP1, they considered the fuel flow sensor to be unreliable.
Inconsistencies with the FIA fuel flow meter have been prevalent all weekend up and down the pit lane.
