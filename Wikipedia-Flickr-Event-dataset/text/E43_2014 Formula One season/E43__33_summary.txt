The world champion's Red Bull deal had been set to expire at the end of this year, though he had an option for 2012.
"It's good to have it done and tidied up prior to the beginning of the season - rumours had already started about other teams," Horner told the BBC.
Vettel has been with Red Bull Racing since 2009, but was supported by the team's partner drinks company's young driver programme for over a decade before then.
"He's been with Red Bull since 1998, so it was a logical thing to do," Horner said.
