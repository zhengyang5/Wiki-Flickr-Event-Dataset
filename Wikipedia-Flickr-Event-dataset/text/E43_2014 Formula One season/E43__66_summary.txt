Having been discussed amongst the Technical working group for some time, the 2013 Technical regulations have now been published, with a just couple of small updates.
This would have looked similar to the step nose and fairing, but would have been less safe in a side impact.
In Mercedes case this effect is to blow through a duct and stall the front wing when DRS is open.
With the new DRS rules preventing part of the 2012 DDRS effect, teams could still exploit a stalling front wing.
A technical directive was sent out about the practice and now that has made it into the rule book.
