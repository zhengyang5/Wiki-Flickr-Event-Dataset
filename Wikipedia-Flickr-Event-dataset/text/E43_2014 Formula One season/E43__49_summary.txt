Alexander Rossi will make his Formula One debut in this weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix in place of Max Chilton.
Marussia say the change is being made due to “contractual issues” with Chilton.
It is also exciting to be given this opportunity at such a fantastic and historical circuit as Spa-Francorchamps.
I can’t wait to drive the MR03 from tomorrow and I hope to reward the team with a solid race weekend.”Rossi will be the first American driver to compete in a Formula One race since Scott Speed in the 2007 European Grand Prix.
