Protesters jammed Union Square and clashed with NYPD officers as they marched through the streets of New York City in solidarity with Baltimore activists Wednesday night, briefly shutting down the Holland Tunnel and snarling traffic along the West Side Highway - resulting in at least 100 arrests.

What began as a small gathering at Union Square around 6 p.m. swelled to more than 1,000 people, many holding "Justice 4 Freddie Gray" placards while chanting "Black Lives Matter" and continued into the early hours Thursday.

"Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, shut the whole system down!" the crowd shouted and then broke into several smaller protests, moving on to Herald Square, Times Square, Columbus Circle and everywhere in between.

NYPD officers, many wearing riot helmets and carrying handfuls of plastic cuffs, were seen loading several activists into police vans.

"We walked to West Side Highway and the cops cornered people so people were fighting back," Chris Carmack, 18, a political science major at Hunter who lives in Flatbush, told the Daily News.

He came to the protest with his roommate.

"I got a baton to the temple and my roommate got a baton to the stomach," said Carmack, who claims cops retaliated when a protester hurled a water bottle at them.

"Get in there and pick somebody out. Not the press." an unidentified NYPD captain said as he pushed a fellow cop toward the crowd.

One officer was seen manhandling an older woman and tossing her to the pavement as she shrieked.

Another marcher was put in what appeared to be a headlock by an NYPD officer near Madison Square Garden.

Police reported more than 100 people in custody waiting to be processed at 10:30 p.m., many of them detained along the West Side Highway near the tunnel.

Marchers were warned to stay off the street and not to block traffic or risk getting arrested. The NYPD handed out flyers and announced their rules of engagement with an audio recording.

It didn't deter the likes of Nes Roberts, 40, from Flatbush.

"I couldn't be in my bed knowing that people from all walks of life are out here and black youths are getting killed," Roberts told The News. "I couldn't see not coming out here when people like myself are getting killed."

At least one officer was hurt. NYPD Capt. Brendan Timoney was struck on the chin by a flying object at Fifth Ave. and 17th St., cops said.

There was no word on other injuries.

Freddie Gray, 25, died more than two weeks ago after his spine was nearly severed while in Baltimore police custody.

His death sparked fiery riots in Baltimore and the latest in a series of rallies that have gripped NYC since a violent summer that saw the deaths of Eric Garner in Staten Island and Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson, Mo., at the hands of cops.

Several more high-profile incidents have happened since then from Cleveland to South Carolina, casting a light on racial justice and police use of force.
