BALTIMORE (Reuters) - As night falls on Baltimore on Tuesday, thousands of police and National Guard troops fanned out to enforce a new curfew and prevent further violence as the mayor fended off criticism that she responded sluggishly to a night of rioting, looting and fires.
“The mayor of Baltimore had the city of Baltimore police on the ground.
All the rest of the (boots) on the ground came from us,” the Republican governor said the day after declaring a state of emergency in the largely black city.
Rawlings-Blake imposed a one-week curfew but stressed the need to respond in a way that did not incite more violence.
