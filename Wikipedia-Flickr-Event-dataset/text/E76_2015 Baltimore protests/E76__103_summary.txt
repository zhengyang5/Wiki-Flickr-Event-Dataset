In solidarity with protesters in Baltimore, a group of roughly 60 people demonstrated in downtown Seattle on Wednesday evening.
The objective was not only to show solidarity with the protesters in Baltimore but to protest police brutality in general, organizers said.
After assembling at Westlake Park, the demonstrators moved through downtown Seattle, chanting: “If you’re not furious you’re not paying attention,” and “Say no more, this must stop.” They held up signs such as, “Get organized for an actual revolution.”Two dozen Seattle police officers followed the march.
“It’s really too bad.”Lane talked about the images she’s been seeing from Baltimore, and other parts of the country.
