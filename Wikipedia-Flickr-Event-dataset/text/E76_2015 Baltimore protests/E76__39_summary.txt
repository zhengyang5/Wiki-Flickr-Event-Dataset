As Baltimore erupts in riots on Monday, police are saying that some of the violence may come from a flyer calling for “The Purge” in the city.
In the movie, the 24-hour-long purge leads to widespread violence and looting, just as the city of Baltimore has experienced on Monday.
The Baltimore purge flyers called for students to gather at Mondawmin Mall starting at 3 p.m. and for them to then move toward downtown.
It appears the Baltimore purge flyers have played a large part in the escalation of violence there.
The Windsor school district stepped in to squash the plans for vandalism.
