Between 40 and 45 Montgomery County police officers have been deployed to work in Baltimore since fires and looting broke out in the city following the Monday funeral of Freddie Gray, a city resident who died in police custody eight days earlier.

Montgomery County is one of several jurisdictions that sent officers to Baltimore per the terms of a mutual aid agreement with the city, said Capt. Paul Starks, who heads the county police department’s Public Information Office.

“[Members] can request mutual aid and assistance, personnel or other resources,” Starks said on Friday.

As of Friday, National Guard troops are stationed in parts of the city, and residents remain under a nighttime curfew ordered by city Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.

On Friday the city’s State’s Attorney’s office announced that six Baltimore City officers are facing involuntary manslaughter, misconduct and other charges related to Gray’s death from a neck injury.

The Montgomery County officers, who are working in Baltimore on 12-hour shifts, are members of the county’s Special Event Response Team, Starks said.

“They’ve been trained and equipped to respond to keep the peace and prevent injuries and vandalism when there are large protests,” Starks said.

The Montgomery County officers are expected to work through the weekend and possibly beyond, depending on Baltimore’s needs.

“Our coverage [in Baltimore] is fluid,” said Starks, adding that the deployment has not negatively affected police coverage in Montgomery County, which employs about 1,200 officers.

“Our staffing is adequate to maintain the safety [of the county],” Starks said.
