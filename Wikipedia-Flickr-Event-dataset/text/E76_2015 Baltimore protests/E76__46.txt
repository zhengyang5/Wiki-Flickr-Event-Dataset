The American Visionary Art Museum's Kinetic Sculpture Race, postponed earlier this month because of unrest in the wake of Freddie Gray's death, has been rescheduled for June 14.

The distinctive event features human-powered machines traveling by land and by sea through the city's parks and neighborhoods. It was originally scheduled for May 2. According to a press release issued today, organizers "hope to attract even more crowds to the race's many stops" for the 17th annual event.

“The race has always been dedicated to the delight, communal participation, peace and love of our City," said Rebecca Alban Hoffberge, AVAM's founder and director, via the press release. "This is a race that Baltimore loves, the world watches, and one that affirms grassroots community at its best! Mega thanks to our Maryland State Delegates, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and her staff, Baltimore City Police, Baltimore Office of Promotions and the Arts, Baltimore’s Department of Recreation and Parks, Kinetic racers & volunteers, AVAM’s staff, and all who worked diligently to help us declare: The RACE is ON!”

According to the release, this year's event will have an "Out of the World" theme in honor of the Hubble Space Telescope, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary.

The race's route and schedule are still pending, according to the release. For more information, go to kineticbaltimore.com.
