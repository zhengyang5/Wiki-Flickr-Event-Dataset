Instead, an unlikely coalition of gang members, pastors and community activists successfully turned away would-be trouble-makers before they even crossed the street.
Gang members, including Orlando "Magic" Gilyard, a Bloods gang member dressed in red, were among the first to arrive at the mall this afternoon.

Side by side with the gang members were pastors from several different churches, as well as unaffiliated community activists and leaders.
