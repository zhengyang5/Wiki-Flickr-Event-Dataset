Freddie Gray, a Baltimore man injured during an arrest by Baltimore police last week, died Sunday at Shock Trauma, prompting protests by city residents and out-of-town activists and promises from city officials for a thorough investigation.
Gray, 25, died a week after he suffered a broken vertabra after being arrested near Gilmor Homes in Sandtown-Winchester.
As a family attorney raised questions about the circumstances surrounding Gray's death, his stepfather, Richard Shipley, said relatives were too distraught to talk.
A Shock Trauma spokeswoman confirmed Gray's death but provided no further details.
Baltimore residents protest and officials respond after the death of Freddie Gray, 27, who was injured while he was being arrested on April 12.
