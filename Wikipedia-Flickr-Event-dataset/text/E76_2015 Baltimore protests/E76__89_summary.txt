Prosecutors gave notice this week that they intend to file an appeal in an attempt to force Officer William G. Porter to testify in the trials of three of his fellow officers.
Porter's attorneys had appealed a decision by Circuit Judge Barry G. Williams to force Porter to testify in those trials.
Williams rejected a request Jan. 20 by the prosecutors to call Porter to the witness stand in the trials of Nero, Miller and Rice.
Then, at the Jan. 20 hearing, prosecutors argued that Porter was a witness in those officers' trials as well.
Williams sided with the defense attorneys, denying the prosecution's requests to compel Porter to the stand in those three officers' trials.
