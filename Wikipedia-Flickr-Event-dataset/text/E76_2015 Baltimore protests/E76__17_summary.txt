At one point, she said, when officers tried to check on him, Mr. Gray was unresponsive, yet no action was taken.
A short time later, Officer Goodson “proceeded to the back of the wagon in order to observe Mr. Gray,” she said.
“At no point did he seek, nor did he render, any medical help for Mr. Gray,” Ms. Mosby said.
Opening the van once again, they “observed Mr. Gray unresponsive on the floor of the wagon,” Ms. Mosby said.
A medic was summoned and found Mr. Gray in cardiac arrest.
