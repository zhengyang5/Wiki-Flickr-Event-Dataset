The unemployed mother of six said she didn't want her only son to end up like Freddie Gray, the young man whose unexplained death in police custody ignited the violence in the city.
The judgment of the public seems to be that we need more mothers like Toya Graham, mothers who are ferocious about keeping their children in line.
My husband used to say that the only reason he didn't beat our son was because the boy would never give him a reason to stop.
If we put her technique aside for a moment, we can see clearly why Toya Graham deserves our praise.
But we saw something else in this mother, and it wasn't just her determination to keep her boy safe.
