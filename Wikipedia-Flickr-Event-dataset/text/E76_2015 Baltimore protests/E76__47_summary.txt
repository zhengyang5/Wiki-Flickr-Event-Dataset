The Orioles and White Sox will play Wednesday at Camden Yards in a game that will be closed to the public.
The White Sox were in Baltimore for a three-game series that had been slated to start Monday, and it was their only planned visit on the schedule.
Since 1987, the lowest attendance has been 746 when the White Sox hosted Toronto at Comiskey Park on April 9, 1997, according to Stats LLC.
The New York Yankees' home game against the White Sox on Sept. 22, 1966, had a listed attendance of 413.
Now the White Sox are on the verge of performing in front of no one.
