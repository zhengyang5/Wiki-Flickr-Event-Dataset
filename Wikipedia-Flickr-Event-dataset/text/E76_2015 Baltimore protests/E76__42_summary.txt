Douglass Students Say They Got A Bad RapStudents at Frederick Douglass High School bristled Wednesday at suggestions that they were involved in the riots that erupted near their school Monday after the funeral of 25-year-old Freddie Gray.
For one thing, they said, the rioting at Mondawmin Mall began around 3:00 p.m., an hour before they get out of school.
In addition, the Mondawmin Metro Station is a major transportation hub where students from many schools meet on their way to and from classes every day.
The students expressed their concerns in front of Hip Hop artist and Maryland native Wale, who visited the school at the request of the Rev.
Deputy Mayor Dawn Kirstaetter, who was at the school as well, apologized on behalf of the mayor.
