More than 2,500 people had joined a Baltimore cleanup effort Facebook event as of Tuesday afternoon, and the numbers continue to grow.
"I thought it was my civic duty to come out to restore my neighborhood," Baltimore resident Myra Keane told CBS Baltimore.
Repair and cleanup efforts began on a micro scale, as individuals took to the streets with supplies to sweep up broken glass and debris.
