On Wednesday night as the 10 p.m curfew passed in Baltimore, hundreds of police officers in riot gear stood with nothing to do at the scene of Monday's civil unrest.
Baltimore police released many of those arrested during this week's unrest, according to the Baltimore Sun.
John Kowalczyk of the Baltimore City Police Department said on Wednesday.
Kowalczyk said police arrested 35 people — 34 adults and 1 juvenile — since the beginning of curfew on Tuesday night.
Also on Wednesday, rush-hour traffic resumed and public schools reopened in Baltimore after city streets were largely quiet overnight.
