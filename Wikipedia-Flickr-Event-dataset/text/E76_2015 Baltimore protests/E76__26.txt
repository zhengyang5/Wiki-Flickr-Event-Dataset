BALTIMORE (AP) — Fans at the Baltimore Orioles-Boston Red Sox baseball game were briefly asked to stay inside the stadium toward the end of the game after a small group of Freddie Gray protesters became violent.

The protesters blocked an intersection near Oriole Park at Camden Yards for several hours and had a tense standoff with police Saturday night. The protesters were eventually cleared.

In the middle of the ninth inning, the public address announcer told fans that city officials requested no one leave because of "ongoing public safety issues." They were later allowed to leave but advised to avoid certain areas of the city. The Orioles won 5-4 in 10 innings.

The attendance was 36,757.
