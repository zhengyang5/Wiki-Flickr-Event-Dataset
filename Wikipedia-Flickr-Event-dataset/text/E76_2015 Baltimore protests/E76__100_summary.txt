Protesters crossed into northeast Minneapolis just after 8 p.m., with the marchers gathering near 2nd Street for a concert by rapper Brother Ali.
They shouted “no justice, no peace, prosecute the police” and demanded justice for ‪Gray and for black lives everywhere.
The march lasted for about three hours and had a clear message: Black Lives — and all lives — matter.
Earlier in December, “Black Lives Matter” caused a closure of Interstate 35W just outside of downtown Minneapolis.
