The funeral was not explicitly mentioned in the announcement of the credible threat, but the threat was revealed minutes before the service was set to begin.
Gray's funeral service was held at Baltimore's New Shiloh Baptist Church at 11 a.m. with a public viewing hour beforehand.
"Most of us are not here because we knew Freddie Gray, but we're all here because we knew lots of Freddie Grays," family attorney Billy Murphy said at the service.
Gray's wake was held on Sunday and protests were held during that time, as well.
The lawyer representing the Gray family said that more video of Gray's interactions with police may exist.
