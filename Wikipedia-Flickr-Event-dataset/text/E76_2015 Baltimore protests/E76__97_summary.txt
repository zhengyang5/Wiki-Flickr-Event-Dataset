ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) - While Albuquerque protesters marched in solidarity with Baltimore Wednesday afternoon, Albuquerque's streets were a far cry from the chaos seen in Baltimore over the past few days.
Many held signs reading "Black Lives Matter" while others marched with signs decrying police violence.
While police had a heavy presence nearby in case things took an ugly turn, the protests remained peaceful.
"Albuquerque is one police incident away from it turning into Baltimore or Ferguson or New York," McClelland said.
Protests over the police shooting of homeless camper James Boyd turned ugly.
