OAKLAND — A dwindling group of protesters marching in Oakland in the vicinity of Telegraph Avenue and 27th Street were ordered to leave the area late Monday, according to police.

Earlier in the evening roughly 100 people gathered at Broadway and 14th Street to show solidarity with demonstrators in Baltimore, carrying signs that said “Rest in Power Freddie Gray.”

As the group moved from the downtown area to West Oakland, around 7:10 p.m., CHP officers blocked an on-ramp in the vicinity of Interstate 980 and the interchange with Interstate 880 in an effort to prevent demonstrators from walking onto the freeway.

Monday’s action in Baltimore over the in-custody death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, a black man who died of a spinal injury, prompted Oakland police to increase staffing levels in anticipation of solidarity protests, Oakland city officials announced Monday afternoon.

Throughout the day, police in Baltimore reported that officers were being pelted with rocks and bottles.

Cars were set on fire, businesses were looted and police officers were injured, according to authorities.

Baltimore police responded with tear gas and pepper balls, according to media reports. The city of Baltimore declared a 10 p.m. curfew and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency.

Fearing a repeat of near-constant protests late last year over the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the death of Eric Garner in New York by a police chokehold, city of Oakland officials say they have directed police resources to areas where “there may be protest activity.”
