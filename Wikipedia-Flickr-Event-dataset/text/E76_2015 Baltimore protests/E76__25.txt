The Baltimore Mayor's Office and city police department asked fans at Camden Yards for Saturday's Orioles vs. Boston Red Sox game to remain in the park until further notice due to protests in the area that turned violent earlier in the day.

Two people were hurt and at least a dozen were arrested Saturday in the largest Freddie Gray rally to date. Thousands of protestors took to the streets and the demonstrations grew violent later in the afternoon when police car windows and storefronts were smashed.

The Baltimore Sun's Eduardo A. Encina and MASN's Roch Kubatko later reported the Camden Yards gates reopened for fans to exit after the Orioles won 5–4 in 10 innings on a walkoff home run by David Lough.

Fans now allowed to leave ballpark. Told safest routes. Avoid Howard St. going North and especially harborplace — Roch Kubatko (@masnRoch) April 26, 2015

From TIME:

The problems happened near Camden Yards, where the Baltimore Orioles game against the Boston Red Sox went on as scheduled. Before the game, demonstrators fought with fans at a bar. Gray died April 19 after suffering a fatal spinal injury while in custody. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray’s spine was injured. Video showed him being dragged into a police van and police have said he rode in the wagon for about 30 minutes before paramedics were called. Police have said Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the department’s policy.

Due to events outside Oriole Park at Camden Yards, spectators are asked to stay inside the stadium til further notice @Orioles @RedSox @MLB — Baltimore OEM (@BaltimoreOEM) April 26, 2015
