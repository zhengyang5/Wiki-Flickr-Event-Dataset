Members of the group Ann Arbor to Ferguson organized the event to commemorate the Haymarket Affair in 1886, where workers who were peacefully protesting job conditions were beaten and killed by the police in Chicago.
Rackham students Maryam Aziz and Austin McCoy said holding the protest on International Workers' Day ties together broader labor issues that impact both workers and Black Americans.
He mentioned specifically the killing of Aura Rosser by the Ann Arbor Police Department in November.
McCoy and Ann Arbor to Ferguson have been protesting and raising awareness about the issue, while also helping Rosser’s family, since her death.
He said he has been following Ann Arbor to Ferguson’s movement since its beginning, and finds it important to teach younger generations about social justice and community activism.
