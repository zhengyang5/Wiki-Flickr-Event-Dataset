The Nation of Islam has been actively working with the police to quell the riots.
On Monday the Baltimore Police Department reported receiving a "credible threat" that several gangs were planning to try to "take out" law enforcement officers.
On Monday night, CNN's Marc Lamont Hill said he was "in contact" with street gangs.
Hill further credited the Nation of Islam for helping violent gangs finding the middle, nonviolent ground.
"When police were not there protecting the property of poor people the Nation of Islam was there," Hill said.
