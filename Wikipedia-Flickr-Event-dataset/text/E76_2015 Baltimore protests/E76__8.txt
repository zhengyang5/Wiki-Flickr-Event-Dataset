State fire marshals have charged a man they believe punctured a fire hose at the scene of a fire in Baltimore on Monday night.

Greg Bailey, 22, was charged with obstructing firefighting operations, malicious destruction of property and reckless endangerment, the State Fire Marshal's office announced Friday night.

Bailey was already being held at the Baltimore City Detention Center on unrelated charges.

The fire marshals credited social media with helping identify Bailey as the suspect in the crime. A Baltimore police officers recognized pictures of the suspect that were circulated online and on social media, and contacted fire marshals.

Since Monday, investigators have been searching for the person responsible for puncturing fire hoses as firefighters tried to extinguish a fire at the CVS pharmacy at the intersection of North and Pennsylvania avenues during the height of Monday's violence and rioting.

The suspect — who wore a distinctive gray and red hooded sweatshirt and a gas mask — was captured on video puncturing the fire hoses.

Online court records indicate that a 22-year-old man named Greg Bailey from the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello neighborhood was charged Tuesday with second-degree escape, possession of a dangerous weapon with intent to injure and attempted theft of less than $100. The circumstances surrounding that arrest were not immediately available.
