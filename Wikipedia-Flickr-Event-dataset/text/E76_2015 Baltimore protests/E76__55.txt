One of the most powerful images from one year ago was a senior center in east Baltimore burning to the ground.

The Mary Harvin Senior Center was under construction -- about 45 percent complete -- when it was destroyed.

The badly needed project was five years in the making.



A week after it burned, city leaders announced a plan to rebuild, and on Wednesday, Gov. Larry Hogan and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake celebrated its opening.



"This is a celebration of the city Baltimore, a city that has endured a national stigma from 'The Wire' to the fire," said Pastor Donte Hickman, with the Southern Baptist Church.

"It was terrible, terrible. You couldn't hardly see the building, because there's so much smoke and then the flames," said Adline Allen, who lives across the street.

"It was really devastating that night, and we did a lot of heavy praying and everything from the Lord," said Vanessa Bizzelle, a church member.

The Mary Harvin Senior Center, in conjunction with Southern Baptist Church, which has programs in the building, vowed to rebuild. Wednesday's reopening comes more than two months ahead of schedule.

Officials said its completion moves the community and its partners one step closer to the shared goal of neighborhood renewal and community transformation.

"It's awesome to know that we're moving in the right direction. We're taking steps toward rebuilding the community," Bizzelle said.

The $15 million housing development has replaced a blighted block with 61 units of affordable senior housing and services, as well as counseling and job training space. But to those in the neighborhood, it's much more than that.

"What was once a symbol of violence and destruction is now a beacon of hope and an example of the resilience that truly defines the amazing people of this great city," Hogan said.

The senior center is already full to capacity with residents.
