A protest in downtown Denver on Wednesday evening turned violent and police used force and pepper spray on demonstrators.
A line of police officers on motorcycles shadowed the protesters as they neared Broadway.
“The next thing I knew pepper spray was being sprayed into the audience.
“Then the guys in green, about five of them, jumped on him…“That’s when they started hitting everyone in the face with pepper spray.
“There was no violence on the part of the protestors,” Comfort said, his clothes still stinking of pepper spray.
