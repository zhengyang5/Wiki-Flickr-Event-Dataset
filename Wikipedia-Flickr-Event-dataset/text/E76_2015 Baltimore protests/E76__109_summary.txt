Since then, the city has announced a 10 p.m. curfew for all residents and businesses in an effort to calm the unrest.
Some area restaurants have already closed their doors for the sake of safety or because they have been vandalized.
While the need for the curfew is clear, area restaurants and bars in Baltimore's otherwise unaffected neighborhoods will probably feel a pinch in business.
This includes restaurants, entertainment venues and bars, which should be closed during these times.
De Kleine Duivel is open until curfew until further notice, and La Garage will be open for dinner as usual.
