Destruction is estimated at $9 million for about 285 businesses damaged during the recent unrest in Baltimore — which officials say is only a fraction of what the total will be for the damage and economic impact.
The federal agency estimated the damage at $8.9 million to about 285 businesses and $60,000 to two houses — with at least 30 sustaining major damage, officials told the Baltimore Sun.
The city’s economic development arm, the Baltimore Development Corp. (BDC), has released a higher estimate of damaged businesses: 350.
Along with the damaged businesses, officials reported nearly 150 vehicle fires and more than 60 structure fires.
Some of the most severely damaged businesses remain closed, and some of the owners have no source of income.
