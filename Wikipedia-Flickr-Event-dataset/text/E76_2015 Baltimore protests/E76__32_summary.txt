Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is in damage control mode following widespread criticism stemming from her comments Saturday addressing rioting and protests over the death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a spinal cord injury, and died a week later, while being transported in a police van.
"When the people know that the police have been told to stand down anarchy is sure to follow.
"After the violence snowballed, Rawlings-Blake reappeared before news cameras to clarify her earlier statement, saying she had been referring to "protesters, not thugs who want to incite violence and destroy our city," according to the Daily Beast's Michael Daly , who wrote an article headlined "Baltimore Mayor Gave Permission to Riot.
"The police sought to balance the rights of the peaceful demonstrators against the need to step in against those who were seeking to create violence.
The mayor is not saying that she asked police to give space to people who sought to create violence.
