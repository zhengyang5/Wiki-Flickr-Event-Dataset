APThe Ravens have announced that they are canceling their Thursday night draft party as a result of the riots that have engulfed Baltimore.
Authorities have imposed a citywide curfew of 10 p.m. every night this week, and the Ravens have announced that they will call off their party to ensure that no one attending is in violation.
“Out of respect to the curfew in Baltimore, the Ravens have cancelled their Draft Party, which was scheduled for this Thursday (4/30) night (7-11 p.m.) at M&T Bank Stadium,” the team said in a statement.
The Baltimore Orioles also canceled their Monday and Tuesday night home games at the request of local authorities.
