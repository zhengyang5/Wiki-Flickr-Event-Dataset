Support for Baltimore runs strong in the Nation's Capital.
(Published Wednesday, April 29, 2015)A large group of demonstrators took to the streets in Washington to support Baltimore protesters seeking solutions in the police custody death of Freddie Gray.
They said commuters should use New York Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, 10th Street and 5th Street Northwest as alternate routes.
Bensen said the protesters chanted, “All DC cops out of Baltimore.” Gwen Crump, with MPD, told News4 that there are currently no MPD officers in Baltimore.
Bensen described the protest as “peaceful, impassioned and coordinated.”The demonstration in D.C. mirrors efforts in other cities around the country.
