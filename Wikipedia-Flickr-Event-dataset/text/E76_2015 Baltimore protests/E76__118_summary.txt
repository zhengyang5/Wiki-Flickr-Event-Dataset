Baltimore Police say they have received a "credible threat" that rival gangs have teamed up to "take out" law enforcement officers.
Police said in a statement that they have received information that members of "various gangs" — including the Black Guerrilla Family, the Bloods and the Crips — have "entered into a partnership" to harm police.
"Law enforcement agencies should take appropriate precautions to ensure the safety of their officers," police said.
He would not say whether it was believed connected to the ongoing demonstrations regarding the death of Freddie Gray.
In December, the Baltimore FBI office issued a memo that the Black Guerrilla Family gang was targeting "white cops" in Maryland, an agency spokeswoman confirmed.
