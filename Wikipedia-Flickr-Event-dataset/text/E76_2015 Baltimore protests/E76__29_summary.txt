Giordano was tackled and beaten by Baltimore City police outside of Western District headquarters last night while covering protests over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody.
In a video shot by City Paper Managing Editor Baynard Woods you can see Giordano, wearing a green jacket, and a protester, both of whom had just been knocked to the ground by police, being beaten as Woods yells, "He's a photographer!
Five or six police officers in riot gear hit Giordano and the other protester with their shields, knocking them to the ground.
Giordano suffered minor injuries on his arm, but will continue documenting the protests.
