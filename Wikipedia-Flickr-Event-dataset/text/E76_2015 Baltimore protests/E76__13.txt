David Simon to rioters: 'You risk losing this moment for all of us in Baltimore'

The "anger and the selfishness and the brutality" of the rioters in Baltimore disrespects the memory of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old man who died in police custody more than a week ago, writer David Simon said Monday night in a short blog post .

Simon is the creator of the hit HBO series "The Wire," and the author of two books about crime and police in Baltimore.

"First things first," Simon wrote . "Yes, there is a lot to be argued, debated, addressed. And this moment, as inevitable as it has sometimes seemed, can still, in the end, prove transformational, if not redemptive for our city. Changes are necessary and voices need to be heard. All of that is true and all of that is still possible, despite what is now loose in the streets.

"But now in this moment the anger and the selfishness and the brutality of those claiming the right to violence in Freddie Gray's name needs to cease. There was real power and potential in the peaceful protests that spoke in Mr. Gray's name initially, and there was real unity at his homegoing today. But this, now, in the streets, is an affront to that man's memory and a dimunition of the absolute moral lesson that underlies his unnecessary death.

"If you can't seek redress and demand reform without a brick in your hand, you risk losing this moment for all of us in Baltimore. Turn around. Go home. Please."
