The Baltimore Mayor's Office and city police department asked fans at Camden Yards for Saturday's Orioles vs. Boston Red Sox game to remain in the park until further notice due to protests in the area that turned violent earlier in the day.
The Baltimore Sun's Eduardo A. Encina and MASN's Roch Kubatko later reported the Camden Yards gates reopened for fans to exit after the Orioles won 5–4 in 10 innings on a walkoff home run by David Lough.
