An individual in Baltimore punctured holes into a fire hose Monday evening as firefighters attempted to put out a blaze that had engulfed a CVS store previously targeted by looters.
The city of Baltimore descended into chaos on Monday as rioters reportedly hurled rocks, bricks and other items at police officers.
The so-called demonstration was apparently intended to be a march to protest the death of Freddie Gray, who died of a spine injury while in police custody.
The CVS was targeted by looters before it was set on fire.
