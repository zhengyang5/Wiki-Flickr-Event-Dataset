WASHINGTON — Like many area police agencies, the Montgomery County Police Department sent a contingent of officers to Baltimore on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday nights.
Montgomery County is planning a pilot program to equip police with body cameras, and Manger says he’ll be among those to wear one.
As to best practices for policing, Manger says there’s a difference between being effective and being aggressive.
“Obviously, we want to keep our neighborhoods safe, but you can’t do it at the expense of your relationship with a particular neighborhood or community,” he says.
