BALTIMORE (AP) â€” Six days after riots sparked by Freddie Gray's death, Baltimore's mayor lifted a citywide curfew Sunday and faith leaders called for continued activism until justice is achieved.
Sunday's peaceful gathering came two days after the city's top prosecutor announced criminal charges against six officers involved in Gray's arrest.
Police said Sunday that 486 people had been arrested since April 23, and that 113 officers had been injured at riots and protests.
"My number one priority in instituting a curfew was to ensure the public peace, safety, health and welfare of Baltimore citizens," the Democratic mayor said.
More than 200 people were arrested during Monday's riots, and more than half of those were released without charges.
