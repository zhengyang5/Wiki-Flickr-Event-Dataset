Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams rejected the state's case Monday against Officer Edward Nero, acquitting him on all counts for his role in the arrest of Freddie Gray.
Like Officer Nero, these officers have done nothing wrong."
The state's theory for the assault charge had been described by legal observers as novel or even "radical."
Another officer, Lt. Brian Rice, had initially begun chasing Gray, and Miller and Nero had responded to his call for help.
Miller, who faces the same charges as Nero, was given limited immunity and forced to testify by prosecutors.
