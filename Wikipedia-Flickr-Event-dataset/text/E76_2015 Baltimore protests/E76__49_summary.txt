Protesters clash with police near Mondawmin Mall after Freddie Gray's funeral in Baltimore April 27, 2015.
REUTERS/Sait Serkan Gurbuz On Monday afternoon, before Baltimore's worst riots in over 45 years, police officers convened outside the Mondawmin Mall, the city's police commissioner told reporters late Monday night.
Somewhere between 75 and 100 people who "appeared to be high school students" began hurling bricks and stones at the officers, Commissioner Anthony Batts said.
That "purge" was to start at the 3 p.m. at the mall, which is a gathering place for area teens.
The students started pelting the cops, and the officers threw rocks back and sprayed tear gas, according to the Sun.
