With violence against police and looting spiraling out of control in Baltimore, a lot of attention is being given to comments made by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake over the weekend.
Here is video of the controversial part of what the Mayor said:The Mayor’s statement that “we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that” is being taken by some as a statement of intent.
In fact, when you look at the full context, it’s clear the Mayor meant something different (though it’s also true she didn’t say it very clearly).
It’s a very delicate balancing act, because, while we tried to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.
Even reading the Mayor’s statement in the context she desires does not excuse her from responsibility for the decisions she made.
