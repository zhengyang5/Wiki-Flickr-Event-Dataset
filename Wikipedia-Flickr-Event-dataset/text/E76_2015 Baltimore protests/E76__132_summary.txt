Thursday’s deaths continue a grisly and dramatic uptick in murders across Baltimore that has so far claimed the lives of 38 people.
Meanwhile, arrests have plunged: Police are booking fewer than half the number of people they pulled off the streets last year.
The fallout from Gray’s death prompted the mayor to ramp that up, and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch agreed to a more intensive probe into whether the department employs discriminatory policing, excessive force and unconstitutional searches and arrests.
Baltimore was seeing a slight rise in homicides this year even before Gray’s death April 19.
Even before Gray’s death, police were making between 25 and 28 percent fewer arrests each month than they made in the same month last year.
