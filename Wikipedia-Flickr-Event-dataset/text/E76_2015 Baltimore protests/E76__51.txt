UPDATE: 9:53 PM: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan sharply criticized the mayor of Baltimore for refusing to contact him while riots raged. Watch his full statement:

‚ÄúWe declared the state of emergency and I issued the executive order less than 30 seconds after requested by the City of Baltimore. So, it didn‚Äôt take us very long at all. I ‚Äî signed an executive order almost immediately as soon as we received the call and then called the president, there was no delay whatsoever. We‚Äôve had this emergency operation center activated since Saturday. We‚Äôve had hundreds of state police on the ground. We‚Äôve had every single state agency and local agency coordinated out of this operation already for the entire week. I‚Äôve been in daily communication with the mayor, and others in the city, and our entire team has been involved from day one. But frankly, this is a Baltimore city situation. Baltimore city was in charge. When the mayor called me, which quite frankly, we were glad that she finally did, instantly we signed the executive order. We already had our entire team prepared, and in fact I already called General Singh earlier in the day and asked her to get prepared to be called up. We were all in a command center in the second floor of the State House in constant communication and we were trying to get in touch with the mayor for quite some time. She finally made that call, and we immediately took action.‚Äù

UPDATE: 9:44 PM: Rioters shut down Baltimore‚Äôs public schools for Tuesday. Reminder: It was high schoolers passing around flyers calling to anarchy and ‚ÄúThe Purge‚Äù who began to attack cops with bricks.

UPDATE: 8:27 PM: Memos obtained by the Washington Times show that a widely-circulated text reading, ‚ÄúKill all white police officers!! As many as you can!! Bunch of thugs with badges!!‚Äù has alarmed law enforcement:

Law enforcement intelligence officials have put out a warning that someone has sent a text calling on people to kill ‚Äúall white police officers‚Äù in reaction to the death of Freddie Gray while in Baltimore police custody, raising fears violence could spread nationally, according to safety memos obtained by The Washington Times. Officers are being warned of possible ambushes and urged to change travel patterns and to tone down clothes or emblems that identify them as police. The Baltimore police department separately put out a press release on Monday saying various gangs, including the Black Guerilla Family, Bloods and Crips ‚Äúhaver entered into a partnership to ‚Äòtake out‚Äô law enforcement.‚Äù

The Black Guerilla Family allegedly had ties to Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who shot two NYPD cops execution-style in Brooklyn in December, although federal agents denied connections between the two. The gang told members to target white cops to ‚Äúsend a message.‚Äù

There is a significant difference between protesting and violence and those committing these acts will be prosecuted under the fullest extent of the law. ‚ÄúMy thoughts and prayers go out to the men and women in uniform who are actively working to stem this violence and several who been injured in the line of duty.

UPDATE: 5:35 PM: Under intense outrage and scrutiny, Mayor Rawlings-Blake backtracked from her initial comments of ‚Äúwe gave those who wished to destroy space to do that, as well‚Äù after riots broke out Saturday night. Here‚Äôs the full letter:

BALTIMORE, Md. (April 27, 2015)‚ÄîToday, Howard Libit, Director of Strategic Planning and Policy, issued the following statement regarding Mayor Rawlings-Blake‚Äôs comments on the rights of protesters: ‚ÄúWhat she is saying within this statement was that there was an effort to give the peaceful demonstrators room to conduct their peaceful protests on Saturday. Unfortunately, as a result of providing the peaceful demonstrators with the space to share their message, that also meant that those seeking to incite violence also had the space to operate. The police sought to balance the rights of the peaceful demonstrators against the need to step in against those who were seeking to create violence. The mayor is not saying that she asked police to give space to people who sought to create violence. Any suggestion otherwise would be a misinterpretation of her statement.‚Äù This clarification is regarding comments made by Mayor Rawlings-Blake during a recent press conference. The mayor‚Äôs original quote follows (emphasis and clarification added): ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made it very clear that I work with the police and instructed them to do everything that they could to make sure that the protesters were able to exercise their right to free speech. It‚Äôs a very delicate balancing act, because, while we tried to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on, we also [as a result] gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well. And we worked very hard to keep that balance and to put ourselves in the best position to deescalate, and that‚Äôs what you saw.‚Äù

UPDATE: 4:30 PM: The niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. blasted Mayor Rawlings-Blake for ‚Äúinviting violence‚Äù into Baltimore in a letter obtained by Breitbart News.

Your invitation to ‚Äúgive space for those who want to destroy‚Äù is unbelievable. This interpretation of rights to free speech is dangerous Ma‚Äôam. In 1963, my father Rev. AD King, after the firebombing of our home in Birmingham, Alabama, urged hostile protestors to abandon violence and turn to God in prayer instead. Thank God they listened to him, and the even greater voice of his brother, my Uncle MLK, during those turbulent days. Now, you are inviting violence to your city? Who, Ma‚Äôam, will incur the moral and economic costs of picking up the pieces? The innocent taxpayers? We at www.restorethedream2015.com are very concerned. Ma‚Äôam, people are not entitled to pillage and destroy. That is just plain wrong. Our affiliates on the ground in Baltimore are willing to help quell the violent tide. And make no mistake about it; something must be done to save our cities. How did we get here? Where do we go now? Think about this: Baltimore 1965 vs. Baltimore 2015, compare and contrast: 1. Money spent on public schools then vs. now. 2. Amount spent on social welfare payments then vs. now. 3. The size of Government Bureaucracy then vs. now. 4. The number of black elected officials then vs. now. 5. Number of black children born in Baltimore to an intact nuclear family. 6. Number of Black lives MIA by abortion and incarceration. If you look at all six questions/comparisons what you will see is the only statistics to have decreased (1965 to 2015) is the number of black children born in intact nuclear families. Something is wrong. We must stop the killing and advance the healing now!

Several Baltimore police officers sustained injuries after black rioters, angry at the death of long-time drug dealer Freddie Gray, hurled bricks and other objects at them Monday afternoon.

The Mondawmin Mall and the University of Maryland closed down after fliers calling for ‚ÄúThe Purge‚Äù circulated ‚Äî while Baltimore high school students often circulate leaflets calling for the total suspension of law as a part of a gang initiation, businesses frightened by the latest plea for violent mayhem shut down hours ahead of the 3 p.m. riot.

The University of Maryland, Baltimore, posted a warning on its site, according to the Baltimore Sun:

‚ÄúDue to reports from the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) concerning scheduled activities today beginning at 3 p.m., UMB will close today at 2 p.m. at the recommendation of the BPD. These activities may be potentially violent and UMB could be in the path of any violence. The safety of our students and employees is of paramount importance please vacate the campus as soon as possible.‚Äù

Several cops were injured by juvenile and adult rioters who hurled bricks at them.

During a Saturday briefing, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told the city her government allowed black rioters to smash police cars and terrorize residents.

‚ÄúWhile we tried to make sure they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on, we gave those who wished to destroy space to do that, as well,‚Äù she said.
