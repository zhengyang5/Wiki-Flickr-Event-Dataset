Area business owners are seeing the effects of unrest in Baltimore following the funeral of Freddie Gray this week.

According to Korean American Grocers Association International and the Korean Society of Maryland, the count of Korean-owned businesses damaged in the riots had gone up to 40 as of Wednesday.

The city remains under distress, with arrests of protestors after the citywide 10 p.m. curfew that started Tuesday and with looters further damaging properties.

On Tuesday, several Korean-owned businesses were set on fire. Kang Sung-ku, 49, owner of Oxford Tavern, saw his ATM torn out by rioters, while liquor store owner Cho Chang-hyun said he suffered attempts from protestors wanting to break into his store through the wall of an adjacent building.

Baltimore saw some 250 arrests and about 20 injuries during two days of riots.
