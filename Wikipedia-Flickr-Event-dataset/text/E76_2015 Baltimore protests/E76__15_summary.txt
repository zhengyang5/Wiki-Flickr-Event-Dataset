Maryland Governor Lifts State Of Emergency In BaltimoreMaryland Gov.
Larry Hogan has ended a state of emergency in Baltimore imposed after the riots and looting that followed the funeral of Freddie Gray, the black man who, after his arrest, suffered a spine injury and died a week later.
Hogan said Wednesday that all of the National Guard troops and state police called in April 27 to restore order in Baltimore have been withdrawn.
His announcement came the same day Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked the U.S. Justice Department to begin a civil rights investigation into the city's police department.
On May 3, two days later, Rawlings-Blake lifted a 10 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew in the city.
