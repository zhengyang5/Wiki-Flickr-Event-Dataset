In the next morning’s edition of The Baltimore Sun, the Kent State story ran under the picture.
My story was about policing and racial tension in the City of Baltimore.
The fact that the city police were refusing response to portions of Baltimore out of fear of provoking racial unrest was stunning enough to make it the top front-page story in Baltimore the next morning.
You don’t hear the term “black militant groups” in Baltimore these days.
In 1970, Baltimore was a powder keg of racial tension.
