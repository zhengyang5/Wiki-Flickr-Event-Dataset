Support for Baltimore runs strong in the Nation's Capital. News4's Jackie Bensen explains. (Published Wednesday, April 29, 2015)

A large group of demonstrators took to the streets in Washington to support Baltimore protesters seeking solutions in the police custody death of Freddie Gray.

News4’s Jackie Bensen said people began gathering at the Gallery Place Metro location around 7 p.m. Wednesday. The group began moving on foot from Gallery Place toward the Wilson Building.

Metropolitan police are advising people to avoid the area near 7th Street Northwest at H Street. They said commuters should use New York Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, 10th Street and 5th Street Northwest as alternate routes.

More demonstrators began at Dupont Circle, heading east along Massachusetts Avenue. Police are using a rolling road closure to divert traffic.

Bensen said the protesters chanted, “All DC cops out of Baltimore.” Gwen Crump, with MPD, told News4 that there are currently no MPD officers in Baltimore.

Bensen described the protest as “peaceful, impassioned and coordinated.”

The demonstration in D.C. mirrors efforts in other cities around the country. Arrests have been made during protests in New York and Indianapolis.

In Boston, police are expecting 1,000 to 2,000 people to gather in front of Boston police headquarters. They say the protests should be peaceful.
