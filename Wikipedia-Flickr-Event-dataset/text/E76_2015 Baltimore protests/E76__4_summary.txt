Montgomery County is one of several jurisdictions that sent officers to Baltimore per the terms of a mutual aid agreement with the city, said Capt.
On Friday the city’s State’s Attorney’s office announced that six Baltimore City officers are facing involuntary manslaughter, misconduct and other charges related to Gray’s death from a neck injury.
The Montgomery County officers, who are working in Baltimore on 12-hour shifts, are members of the county’s Special Event Response Team, Starks said.
The Montgomery County officers are expected to work through the weekend and possibly beyond, depending on Baltimore’s needs.
“Our staffing is adequate to maintain the safety [of the county],” Starks said.
