David Cowling, Editor BBC Political Research has been digesting five polls - four GB-wide and one Scottish. He says:

"The four GB polls divide, on this occasion, between telephone and internet samples. YouGov gave a one point Labour lead and Populus a three point Labour lead. The two telephone polls suggested Conservative leads – Ashcroft six points and ICM three points. Each of them was sampled over the same period. If we include recent ComRes telephone polls there do appear to be more pronounced Conservative leads under this method. But then nothing is clear-cut in this election. Survation’s last three online polls gave Conservative leads and the last MORI telephone poll gave a two point Labour lead. Damn.

"The TNS Scottish poll was conducted face to face over a two week period. It gave the SNP 54% - the party’s highest rating since the 2014 referendum, with Labour on 22% - its lowest. Intriguingly, the poll found that 29% of those certain to vote 'remain undecided'.
