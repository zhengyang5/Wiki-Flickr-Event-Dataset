The defining feature of voting intention in this election is how little it has moved.
The graph below shows the UK Polling Report polling average for each week so far of 2015.
The broad picture though, especially over the short campaign, is one of no movement.
This is not necessarily unusual – the huge ups and downs of “Cleggmania” in the 2010 election were not typical.
Somewhere between one-in-six and in one-in-five people have postal votes, and many will already have voted, so they cannot change their mind any longer.
