Final results add to signs of last-minute move to Labour but all polls point to hung parliament as London shares slide in pre-election fearsLabour has moved into a wafer-thin one-point lead in the final pre-election Guardian/ICM poll, leaving the country on a knife-edge with the markets starting to jitter.
The difference is still within the margin of error, but every poll is now indicating a hung parliament and the tightest election in decades.
The Guardian’s final poll projection, which takes the full range of recent data into account, suggests that Labour and the Tories could be perfectly balanced in the new House of Commons, with 273 seats each.
ICM’s final “wisdom of crowds index” – respondents’ averaged best guess of how each party will score – continues to put the Tories ahead on 35%, compared to 32% Labour.
But the poll suggests that Labour is now well in front here, by 46% to 35%.
