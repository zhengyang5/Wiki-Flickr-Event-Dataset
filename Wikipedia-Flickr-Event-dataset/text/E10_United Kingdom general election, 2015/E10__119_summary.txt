Meanwhile, the Lib Dems are suffering more and Labour gaining more in LD/Lab seats, so there’s little net change for the Lib Dems.
The overall effect is to move our seats forecast slightly away from the Tories and towards Labour.
Our central forecast is now for the Tories to win 285 seats, leaving them 38 short of a majority.
Labour are 23 behind, on 262, while the SNP get 53 and the Lib Dems 25.
