Sir Stuart said all inquiries were dealt with 'promptly', adding: 'We've three full-time staff who answer telephone inquiries.
Emma Boon, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers write Sir Stuart Bell a whopping pay cheque for working as an MP, it's part of his role to meet local residents and represent them in Parliament.
