Well, it’s getting close now. There are just ten days to go to the general election. (And yes, I know what you are all thinking: if only campaigns could last longer).

While there will continue to be a plethora of GB-wide opinion polls right up until the eve of poll, here in Wales we are unlikely to have any further ones until the next Welsh Political Barometer poll, which should be published on the evening of 6th May.

You can find substantial detail about the various polls that have been conducted in Wales in recent times in the Opinion Polls section of the Blog; I have also discussed them in numerous posts. But I thought that it might be useful to some blog readers – never say I don’t think of you – to provide some summary information on what the Welsh polls have been saying in relatively accessible and concise form.

So here, first of all, are the average general election poll ratings of the main five parties in Wales between 2012-2014. As we can see, the only substantial trend during those years was the decline in Labour support and the rise of UKIP:

Average Poll Ratings for Westminster General Election, Wales

Party 2012 2013 2014 Labour 51.0 48.3 40.5 Conservative 23.5 22.0 23.5 LibDems 6.0 8.3 6.1 Plaid Cymru 10.5 10.3 12.0 UKIP 5.7 8.3 13.4

These are the polls conducted before the start of the campaign in 2015:

And these are the polls that have been conducted during the official campaign itself:

Finally, here is a summary of the main findings from the Ashcroft constituency polls for the five Welsh constituencies that he has looked at. (In the case of Cardiff North he actually polled it twice; I’ve reported the more recent set of figures). Numbers here are for the question asked in these polls that asked people how they would vote in their specific constituency:
