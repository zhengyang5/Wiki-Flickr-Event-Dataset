Good morning! As the first votes are cast, our final forecast makes Ed Miliband the slight favourite to lead the next government, with a 58% chance to David Cameron’s 42%.

There’s no change in our polling forecast: the Tories still lead by 1 point, 34%–33%, and we make them clear favourites to win the most votes, with a 77% chance.

However, we’ve identified more constituency-level effects that change how our model expects those votes to translate into seats. In particular, the Tories are doing less well to UKIP on the east coast, and to the Lib Dems in LD/Con incumbent seats. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems are suffering more and Labour gaining more in LD/Lab seats, so there’s little net change for the Lib Dems. The overall effect is to move our seats forecast slightly away from the Tories and towards Labour.

As a result, the Tories’ chances of winning the most seats are down to 68%, and their chances of a majority have fallen to just 6%. (Labour’s haven’t improved much though. They’re still less than 0.5%.) A hung parliament looks more likely than ever, with a 94% chance.

Our central forecast is now for the Tories to win 285 seats, leaving them 38 short of a majority. Labour are 23 behind, on 262, while the SNP get 53 and the Lib Dems 25. That would leave the Tories unable to form a majority grouping (even Con+LD+DUP+UKIP would be one short, on 322), and Labour reliant on the SNP and either the Lib Dems or all the other left-wing MPs.

We’ll find out soon!
