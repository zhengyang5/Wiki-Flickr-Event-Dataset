Ronnie Carroll, a former UK Eurovision contestant who was due to stand in the 2015 general election, has died at the age of 80.

Born in Belfast in 1934, his biggest hit was Roses are Red.

He represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1962 and 1963 with Ring-A-Ding Girl and Say Wonderful Things, finishing fourth both times.

Mr Carroll was due to stand as an independent in the election in the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency.

He had previously stood unsuccessfully in elections under the banner of parties such as Make Politicians History.

In the Haltemprice and Howden by-election in 2008, he failed in his mission to get no votes, gaining an almost respectable 29.

Born Ronald Cleghorn, he was married at one stage to That Was The Week That Was star Millicent Martin.

Mr Carroll died on Monday following a short illness.
