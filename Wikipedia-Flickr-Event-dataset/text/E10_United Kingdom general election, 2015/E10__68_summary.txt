Labour leader Ed Miliband is to seek the support of union leaders to form a minority government after the election on Thursday, it has emerged.
Miliband will hold talks with union bosses at an emergency meeting of Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC), according to the Times.
A member of the NEC told the newspaper Miliband will seek union backing in forming a government without a majority of seats in the House of Commons.
Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in Northern Ireland have all signaled they will vote down a Conservative Queen’s Speech.
Under internal party rules, Miliband must consult Labour MPs before attempting to form a government without an overall majority in the Commons.
