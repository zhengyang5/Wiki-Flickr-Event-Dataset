The SNP is on course to win an unprecedented clean sweep of all 59 Scottish seats in next week’s general election, according to an astonishing opinion poll predicting Labour is facing extinction in its former fiefdom.
Reacting to the poll’s prediction of a clean sweep, Ms Sturgeon urged her supporters not to be complacent about victory.
The more seats the SNP win, the stronger Scotland will be.
“If people want a strong Unionist party that can take on the SNP, they have to vote for it.
They have to vote Scottish Conservative.
