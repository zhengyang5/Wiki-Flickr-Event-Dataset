The Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), Northern Ireland’s only nationalist party represented at Westminster, has ruled out a general election pact with Sinn Féin.
The party, which will defend three seats in the House of Commons, described electoral pacts as based on “sectarian, selfish interests”.
The SDLP leader and South Belfast MP Alasdair McDonnell told his party’s annual conference on Saturday that it would contest all 18 Northern Ireland’s constituencies in May.
“We will not get distracted by the advances of either [the Sinn Féin deputy first minister] Martin McGuinness or [the Ulster Unionist party leader] Mike Nesbitt seeking pacts.
Either way, the votes cast in the 18 Northern Ireland constituencies may turn out to be crucial.
