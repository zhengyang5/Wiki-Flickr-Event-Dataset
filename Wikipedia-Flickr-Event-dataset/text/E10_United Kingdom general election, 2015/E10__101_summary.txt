Some races were very close and Labour had taken the lead in one constituency where the Tories had been ahead in December.
I have therefore looked at the “next” seven seats by marginality: Milton Keynes South, Rossendale & Darwen, Cleethorpes, North East Somerset, Dudley South, Dover, and South Ribble.
However, I found ties in Rossendale & Darwen (where the Tory vote was unchanged since 2010 at 42%, but Labour were up ten points) and South Ribble.
I found Labour leads in three seats, albeit well within the margin of error: Crewe & Nantwich (by three points), Finchley & Golders Green (by two points) and Milton Keynes South (by two points).
As in the previous round, Labour seem to be having the better of the ground war in all ten of these seats.
