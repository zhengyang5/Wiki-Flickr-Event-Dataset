It has been assumed the the experiment of holding debates in 2010 is here to stay.
According to The Guardian “senior cabinet members” want to cut the number of election debates to from three to just one.
Many Tory MPs blame the David Cameron's failure to secure a majority on his decision to agree to the debates in 2010.
“Now, next week, next year, any time from now until the autumn of 2014.”Even if Salmond fails to win Scottish independence, it is likely the SNP would petition heavily to get their leader into the UK general election debates in 2015.
It will be next to impossible for the deputy prime minister to repeat the feat in 2015 having spent five years in coalition with Cameron, as he has previously admitted.
