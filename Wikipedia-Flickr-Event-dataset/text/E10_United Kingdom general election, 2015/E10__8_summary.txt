Closure of 2013 ReviewAs a result of the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 receiving Royal Assent on 31 January 2013, the date of the next boundary review has been postponed until 2018.
In January 2013, Parliament voted to end work on the 2013 Review, postponing the report of a first Review under the new statutory rules until 2018.
As at the end of December 2012, the 2013 Review had cost the Boundary Commission for England Â£4.7 million.
Will the views I have submitted during this Review be taken into account in the next Review?
Will the representations submitted during this Review be available to the public, even though work on this Review has ended?
