What is a guarantor loan?
A guarantor loan is a loan, which needs a third party to ensure the loan is accepted.
Guarantor loans are designed for those who either have a bad credit history, or none at all.
Once all checks have gone through the money will be deposited in the bank account of the guarantor in a timely fashion.
