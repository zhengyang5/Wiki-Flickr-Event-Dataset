Our final combined forecast is for a Conservative majority 66.
The markets and models predict that the polls are over estimating Labour and under estimating the Conservatives again.
Note that the markets imply fewer seats forecast than there are actually are in the House of Commons.
For the probability of a Conservative majority we give an average of the implied probability from sites offering this market.
We use the proportion of poll respondents who think the Conservatives will win/there will be a Conservative majority, excluding donâ€™t knows and re-percentaging, as the pseudo-probability of a Conservative majority.
