Image caption The 2010 exit poll result was a shock to broadcasters, but an accurate pictureNational exit polls have been used to predict the results of British general elections for 40 years, with mixed results.
The 2010 exit poll result was as near perfection as one is likely to reach - but was greeted by fifty shades of disbelief as soon as it was published.
It may be that the 2015 exit poll will face the same scepticism: the political landscape it will be measuring is certainly more challenging than five years ago.
In 2010, Sky News joined the other two broadcasters in sponsoring the exit poll and this triumvirate continues for the 2015 general election exit poll, which will also be conducted by MORI and NOP.
Analysis polls were abandoned after the 1992 general election and since then there have only been seat prediction exit polls.
