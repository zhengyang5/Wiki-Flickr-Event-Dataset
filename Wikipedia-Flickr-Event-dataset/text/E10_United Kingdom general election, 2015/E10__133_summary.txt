Their main finding agrees with our own research: unrepresentative samples are to blame for the 2015 polling miss.
As the inquiry makes clear, it is important to put the 2015 polling miss into context.
Since turnout is often as much as thirty percentage points too high in polling samples, even demographic groups with low turnout often have high turnout percentages in the samples.
Non-voters from low turnout demographic groups are replaced by voters from these demographic groups, skewing the voter sample.
This is precisely what we think is to blame for the 2015 polling miss.
