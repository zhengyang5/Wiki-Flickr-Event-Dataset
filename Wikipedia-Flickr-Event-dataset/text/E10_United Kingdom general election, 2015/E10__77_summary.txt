The Tories had "made up a £5bn number, the Liberal Democrats a £7bn number and the Labour Party a £7.5bn number".

When it was put to him that he didn't sound impressed, he laughed, saying: "I'm not terribly impressed, particularly with some of the things on the tax side.
He wasn't impressed with spending promises either, complaining that the parties had not provided enough detail on the cuts required.
