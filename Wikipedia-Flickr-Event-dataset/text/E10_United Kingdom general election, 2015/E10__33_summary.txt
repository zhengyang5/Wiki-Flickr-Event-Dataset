The Labour leader Ed Miliband said there would be no SNP ministers in his Cabinet.
Commentators say the two parties could still come to a different arrangement short of a coalition, such as a "vote by vote" deal.
The SNP isn't just any old party, they're a party that thinks that the United Kingdom - our country - shouldn't exist.
And so I think it is pretty despicable, frankly, not to say 'look there's no dealing with them we're going to do'.
