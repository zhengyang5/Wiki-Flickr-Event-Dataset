Former party leader Dafydd Wigley said: “Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the Greens are separate, distinct parties with their own objectives and policies.
“Plaid Cymru MP Cynog Dafis was, in fact, elected in 1992 as MP for Ceredigion on a joint Plaid-Green ticket.
Plaid Cymru and the Greens also have a strong and effective relationship in Brussels, with both parties working together in the Greens/European Free Alliance group.
However, in Wales, where Green candidates may be standing in constituencies where Plaid Cymru either hold or have a realistic chance of winning the sear, voters who support the Green agenda should consider voting Plaid Cymru – in order to strengthen the joint team in the new parliament.
