However, one polling company says that its final poll hit the final result almost perfectly but it was so outlandish a forecast that they decided not to publish it.
The CEO of Survation claims that the final poll conducted by his company on the eve of the election got the final result almost bang on.
It certainly looks like the final Survation poll captured a late swing that only the exit poll seems to have picked up on.
Lyons Lowe says the poll demonstrates that there needs to be "no internal review of polling methodology for Survation post this General Election result."
Fundamentally, Lyon Lowe is saying late polls can measure last minute shifts as demonstrated by his company's final poll.
