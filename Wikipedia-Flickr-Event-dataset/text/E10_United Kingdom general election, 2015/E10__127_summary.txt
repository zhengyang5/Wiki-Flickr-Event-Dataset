From January 2011 to Spring 2013, Labour’s average vote share in the public polls rarely dropped out of the low 40s.
While the public polls had Labour ahead until early spring of this year, in the party's internal polls cross-over came right after conference season in 2014.
Labour's relative inability to reach into the Tory vote proved even more costly than expected.
This technique delivers a much lower don’t know number – generally half the level found in the public polls.
