Expense claims and a Westminster sex scandal were deleted from MPs' Wikipedia pages by computers inside Parliament before the election, The Telegraph has found.
Tory MP Craig Whittaker’s arrest for alleged assault on his son in 2012 was deleted from his Wikipedia page by someone inside the Commons.
However it is unclear why people unconnected to the politician or party would gloss up the Wikipedia biographies from inside Parliament.
In February 2010, based on an audit report looking into the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, Ryan was asked to repay £5,121 mortgage interest.
The sustained effort has proved successful and there is now no mention of Ms Ryan's Parliamentary expenses on her Wikipedia page."
