A Conservative MP has appeared in court to face charges over his 2015 General Election expenses.
Craig Mackinlay is accused of offences under the Representation of the People Act 1983 - along with Marion Little, 62, and Nathan Gray, 28.
In 2015 Mackinlay beat then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, entering parliament with a majority of almost 3,000.
He faces two counts of making a false election expenses declaration while his election agent Gray, of Red Oak, in Hawkhurst, Kent, faces one.
