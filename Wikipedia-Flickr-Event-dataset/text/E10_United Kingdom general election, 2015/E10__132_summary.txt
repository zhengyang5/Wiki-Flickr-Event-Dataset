It follows widespread shock on Thursday at a BBC exit poll, which showed the Tories comfortably ahead of their opponents.
Labour took 232 seats, the SNP have 56, the Liberal Democrats finished on eight, Plaid Cymru won three and UKIP and the Greens took one seat each.
In the run up to the election, almost every major national poll had predicted the race was neck and neck between the two main parties.
It announced Professor Patrick Sturgis, director of the Economic and Social Research Council's National Centre for Research Methods, would chair the inquiry.
