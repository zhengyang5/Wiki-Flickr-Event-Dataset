The Ulster Unionist Party in North Down is to back sitting MP Lady Sylvia Hermon in this year’s General Election.
Explaining the decision, Party Leader, Mike Nesbitt MLA, said:“It is now clear that Lady Sylvia Hermon is to contest the seat again this year.
In our view, she is not only a suitable choice for Ulster Unionists, she is still an Ulster Unionist in spirit, and on that basis it makes no sense to stand a candidate against her.
I believe he is one of several Ulster Unionists in the North Down constituency who has a career in politics ahead of them, and I look forward to him contesting for votes again in the near future.”Councillor McClean said:“In the Ulster Unionist Party, we don’t just say we will do the right thing for Northern Ireland; we walk the walk as well.
I invite all unionists to join us in the Ulster Unionist Party in endorsing and supporting her campaign.
