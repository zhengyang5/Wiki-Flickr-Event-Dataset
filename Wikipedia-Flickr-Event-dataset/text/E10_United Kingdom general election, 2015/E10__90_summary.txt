1) The Labour lead narrowedLabour’s lead has gradually eroded over 2013.
We started the new year showing a Labour lead of around about ten points.
2) People got more optimistic about the economyThere has been a sharp increase in people’s view of where the economy is growing.
That reversed in September and now finds more people think that the cuts are good for the country’s economy, than think they are damaging.
Note also the increase in the number of people mentioning issues of inflation from Autumn, as Labour started to try and shift the agenda more towards cost of living.
