Keeping up with the polls is tiring. Every day creates a new headline. Who’s up and who’s down? Our Poll of Polls keeps track of every poll being published by the UK’s major pollsters – and averages them over time, weighing them by everything from time to track record.

Our data includes nearly 4,500 polls, going all the way back to 16 August 1970. Ted Heath was Prime Minister, the first email hadn't yet been sent and Butler and McKenzie were manning BBC election nights.

What is a guarantor loan?

A guarantor loan is a loan, which needs a third party to ensure the loan is accepted. The lender loan the borrower a certain amount of money, based on the agreement that if the borrower forgoes on a payment the guarantor will step in pay whatever is owed

So who would need a guarantor loan?

Guarantor loans are designed for those who either have a bad credit history, or none at all. So essentially people who have struggled paying back loans, debts or bills in the past, or those who haven’t ever taken one out, such as young people. The guarantor is there, as a safeguard to make sure the lender will receive their money.

Apart from that, how do they differ from a normal loan?

Despite the difference of a third party, they aren’t very different to your standard payday loan. Once all checks have gone through the money will be deposited in the bank account of the guarantor in a timely fashion. The one main difference is the higher rate of interest, generally ranging between 25-50% typical APR.
