Last month, BBC director general Tony Hall rejected the DUP's request to be included in the TV debates.
In the legal letter to the BBC, the DUP says it recognises it would be "proper" to include the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in the debates.
The DUP argues it has no objection "in principle" to the SDLP, UUP, Sinn FÃ©in and Alliance taking part in the debates.
The DUP had written to the BBC and ITV asking for an explanation as to why the party had not been invited to take part in the live televised election debates.
