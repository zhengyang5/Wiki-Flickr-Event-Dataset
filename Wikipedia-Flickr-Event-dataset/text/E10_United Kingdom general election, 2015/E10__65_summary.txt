David Cameron said it was "despicable" that Mr Miliband had not ruled out a post-election deal with the SNP.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said all the Labour leader had done was "rule out something no-one was proposing".
Such is certainly the case with the declaration delivered by Ed Miliband that his Labour party will not enter a coalition with the SNP in the event of a hung Parliament at Westminster after May's election.
Mr Miliband said the "real danger" was a Conservative government propped up by the UK Independence Party.
