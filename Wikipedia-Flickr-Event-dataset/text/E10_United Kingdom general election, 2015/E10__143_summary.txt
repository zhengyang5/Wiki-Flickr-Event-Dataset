The field was so divided that it seemed entirely possible that the winning candidate would be elected on the lowest ever share of the vote by a successful MP anywhere in the UK.
Alasdair McDonnell won re-election to Westminster despite more than 75 per cent of the constituency voting against him.
His 24.5 per cent share of the vote smashed the record for lowest ever winning proportion, held by Russell Johnston who won Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber in 1992 for the Liberal Democrats with 26.0 per cent of the vote.
A former member of the UUP Bob Stoker split the competition for unionist votes by entering the contest for Ukip.
Mr Stoker was not the only former mayor in the race: Máirtín Ó Muilleoir got a strong vote of 5,402 votes for Sinn Fein.
