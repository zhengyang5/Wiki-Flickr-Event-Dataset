Labour is on course for a bloodbath in Scotland in 2015, according to a special Guardian/ICM online poll.
Scottish Labour, which secured a very strong 42% in Gordon Brown’s homeland last time around, has since tumbled by 16 points to just 26%.
That combination is sufficient to wipe out majorities that were always assumed to be impregnable, and Scottish Labour’s Westminster caucus is left shrivelling to just three MPs.
But, by 53% to 23%, the voters are on the SNP’s side, saying that Scotland should be free to set its own corporation taxes.
They have also been weighted to respondents’ recall of the 2011 Holyrood election and to the independence referendum results.
