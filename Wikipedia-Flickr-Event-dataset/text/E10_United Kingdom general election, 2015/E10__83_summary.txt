WHEN writing its election manifesto, a sensible political party strikes a compromise between its own grand ideals and the practical realities of voters’ lives.
In 1983 the Labour Party offered a vision of red-hot socialism to a public warming to Thatcherism (“the longest suicide note in history”, it came to be called).
He called his opponents a “party of sums that do not add up and commitments that will not be kept”.
With the election so unpredictable and their own standing among voters so weak, neither dares go out on a limb.
Britain’s next government will be led by a party, Labour or Tory, that went into the election deeply unsure of itself.
