The next election is shaping up to be one of the most bitterly fought – and most difficult to predict – in a generation.
May2015 aims to give readers the tools they need to understand the the big currents underlying British politics.
May2015 will be edited by Harry Lambert – who approached us with the idea of a specialist election portal earlier in the year.
The first bit of May2015 we’re most excited about is our poll of polls – an interactive element allowing users to see all the election data produced by polling companies back to 1970.
