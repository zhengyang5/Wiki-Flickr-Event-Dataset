After Ashcroft’s first batch of Scottish polls were leaked at midnight on February 4, we extrapolated them to suggest the SNP would win 56 seats, as per the graphic below.
*But the Lib Dems are also cautious about Ashcroft’s results.
Some pundits don’t like the Lib Dems’ methodology, but there is not only one agreed way to ask voting intention questions.
More importantly, the Lib Dems actually refer to the local candidate in their polls by name, whereas Ashcroft only alludes to them.
