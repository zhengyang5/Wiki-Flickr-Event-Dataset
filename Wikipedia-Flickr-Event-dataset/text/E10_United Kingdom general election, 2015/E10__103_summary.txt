In the survey, Clegg is one point behind the Labour candidate Oliver Coppard, who is on 37%.
The gap between the two has got closer since the last poll in March, which had Labour three points ahead.
Clegg’s majority is around 15,000 but Labour have been fighting hard in the seat in an attempt to “decapitate” the Lib Dems.
Ashcroft’s poll also found the Conservatives two points ahead of Farage in South Thanet on 34%, while Ukip is on 32% and Labour is further behind on 26%.
Lord Ashcroft (@LordAshcroft) Are Labour voters in Thanet South lending their votes to the Tories to stop Farage?
