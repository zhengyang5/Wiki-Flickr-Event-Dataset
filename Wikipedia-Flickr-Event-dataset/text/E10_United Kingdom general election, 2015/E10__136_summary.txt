The Liberal Democrats have suffered a tsunami of lost votes, MPs, and councillors.
Its 830 members make it the second largest second chamber in the world, after the House of Chiefs in Tonga.
The Conservatives gained their overall majority by stoking up English and Welsh people’s fears and implying that Scottish MPs would dominate Westminster.
The results of this election are monstrously unfair, not just to the Liberal Democrats (with 1% of the seats on 8% of the vote).
The Liberal Democrats, Greens and Ukip together got 25% of the votes cast, but only 10 MPs – 1.5% of the House of Commons.
