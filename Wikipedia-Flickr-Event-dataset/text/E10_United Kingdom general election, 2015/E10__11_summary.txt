Why do the coalition parties disagree on boundary changes?
Did Tories and Lib Dems have the changes in their election manifestos?
Under the plans, Wales would lose 10 seats, Scotland would lose seven seats, Northern Ireland two seats and England 31 seats.
There is no Conservative majority in the Commons and Labour and Lib Dems MPs expected to vote in favour of the amendment.
The SNP, Plaid Cymru, the SDLP and the Green Party have all expressed their opposition to boundary changes, making it unlikely that a majority of MPs could be found to vote for the reforms.
