A Conservative MP has appeared in court to face charges over his 2015 General Election expenses.

Craig Mackinlay is accused of offences under the Representation of the People Act 1983 - along with Marion Little, 62, and Nathan Gray, 28.

The 50-year-old retained his seat of South Thanet in Kent in the recent General Election with an increased majority of 6,387, just one week after it was announced he would be prosecuted.

Mackinlay, who gave his address as Ramsgate in Kent, arrived at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning with his wife Kati.

The Crown Prosecution Service said the decision to press charges followed an investigation by Kent Police into allegations surrounding Conservative Party expenditure during the 2015 election campaign.

The decision was made before the 11 June statutory limit on prosecutions.

In 2015 Mackinlay beat then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, entering parliament with a majority of almost 3,000.

He faces two counts of making a false election expenses declaration while his election agent Gray, of Red Oak, in Hawkhurst, Kent, faces one.

Campaign director Little, of New Road, in Ware, Hertfordshire, faces three counts related to aiding Mackinlay and Gray in making false declarations.

All three defendants indicated not guilty pleas when the charges were read to them.

The case has been sent for trial at Southwark Crown Court.

The defendants, who were released on unconditional bail, will next appear on 1 August.
