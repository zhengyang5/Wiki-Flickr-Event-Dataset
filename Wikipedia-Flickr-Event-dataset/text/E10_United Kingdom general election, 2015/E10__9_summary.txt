Sixth Review of UK Parliament ConstituenciesSixth Review index | Initial Proposals | Revised Proposals | Cessation | Resources | Electorate data | ConsultationIn January 2013, Parliament amended the legislation governing our Sixth Review of UK Parliament Constituencies.
The revised legislation requires us to undertake our next review of UK Parliament constituencies using the electoral register from 1 December 2015, and to submit our report on that review during September 2018.
The legislation governing our reviews of UK Parliament constituencies is the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986.
The text of the legislation as it applied at the start of the Sixth Review is available on the Resources section of the Sixth Review pages of this website.
Since revised constituencies resulting from our Review will not now be introduced, we expect that the next general election to the UK Parliament, due to take place in May 2015, will be contested using the UK Parliament constituencies that have existed in Scotland since 2005.
