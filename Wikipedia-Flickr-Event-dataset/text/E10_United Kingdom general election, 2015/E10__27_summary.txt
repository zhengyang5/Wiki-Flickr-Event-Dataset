Today the Trust launches the final stage of its consultation process on the BBC’s approach to covering this year’s General Election, English local, and mayoral elections.
The Trust’s consultation on the BBC’s draft election guidelines began at the start of November and at the time the Trust said there would be an extra consultation period in the New Year of 2015 on additional material relevant to the election guidelines when it became available.
The consultation will end on 11 February and the Trust will consider responses before approving and publishing the final election guidelines and the supporting appendices.
Please note that the Trust is not consulting on which politician or party should be invited on individual programmes such as the leaders’ debate programme/s.
However as the debates form part of the BBC’s coverage during the election, they will have to be consistent with the BBC’s guidelines.
