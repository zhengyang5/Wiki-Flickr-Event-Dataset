A total of 70 polls have been published since the formal start of the election campaign on 30 March.
Labour has had far more spikes downwards than upwards in the second half of the campaign.
The party has touched 30% or below on five occasions, whereas in the first half of the campaign it never dipped below the early-mid 30s.
But they are not achieving any spikes upwards – at least, nothing to match that sudden (and undoubtedly rogue) jump up to 39% earlier in April.
