When a party goes up or down in the polls there is inevitably speculation as to why.
Daily polling does at least give us an idea of when movements in public opinion have happened, and therefore make inferences about what events may have caused them.
The graph below shows a five day rolling average of UKIP’s support in YouGov’s daily poll since the end of 2011.
All of this is still a far cry from proving what causes the ups and downs in UKIP support, after all, correlation does not prove causality.
Note also the biggest drop in UKIP support, back at the end of 2011 at the time of David Cameron’s veto in Europe.
