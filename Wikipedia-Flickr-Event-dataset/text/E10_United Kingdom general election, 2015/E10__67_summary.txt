U.K. Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said his strategy for forming a government if he falls short of a majority will be to dare other parties to vote him down.
Polls suggest neither Labour nor Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservatives will come close to winning a majority in Thursday’s general election.
Because Cameron, as the incumbent, gets the first opportunity, Miliband will only get a chance if Cameron has tried and failed, or simply stood aside.
“I want to put forward a Labour Queen’s Speech, we’re going to put forward a Labour budget and it will be for the House of Commons to decide how it votes,” Miliband told BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program Monday.
Case-by-CaseA minority government would have to win support for measures on a case-by-case basis.
