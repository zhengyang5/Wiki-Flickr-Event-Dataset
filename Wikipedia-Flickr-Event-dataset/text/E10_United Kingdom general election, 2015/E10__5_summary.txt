Following Theresa May's announcement of an early general election on 8 June 2017, the Conservatives have released the following transcript of her remarks outside Downing Street:"I have just chaired a meeting of Cabinet where we agreed that the Government should call a general election to be held on the 8th June.
Britain is leaving the European Union and there can be no turning back.
If we do not hold a General Election now their political gameplaying will continue and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election.
And so tomorrow I will move a motion in the House of Commons calling for a general election to be held on the 8th June.
Let us tomorrow vote for an election, let us put forward our plans for Brexit and our alternative programmes for government and then let the people decide.
