If there is a hung parliament, one significant misunderstanding that may arise concerns who gets to become Prime Minister.
The role of the Queen in selecting a Prime Minister is also likely to be misreported.
The incumbent Prime Minister and his ministers remain in office.
If things remain uncertain even after three weeks, then the votes on the Queenâ€™s Speech may be more than the usual formality, with the result potentially determined by minor parties or dissatisfied backbenchers.
We favour a clearer process where the first business of parliament is an explicit vote on who should become Prime Minister (as in Scotland).
