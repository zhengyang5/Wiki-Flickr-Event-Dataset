David Cameron has been accused of an unjustifiable bid to “buy the general election” as it emerged that ministers have quietly slipped through an unprecedented hike in the amount that parties can spend during the campaign.
The change to the law on candidates’ election spending, passed without parliamentary debate, was made despite a direct warning by the commission against such “excessive spending to prevent the perception of undue influence over the outcome of the election”.
Lucy Powell MP, Ed Miliband’s key general election strategist, admitted that Labour “can’t match the depths of Tory pockets” and accused the prime minister of seeking to “buy an election they don’t deserve to win”.
He promised to address the ‘big donor culture’, arguing that we should, ‘cut what is spent on a general election’.
Since the last general election, the Tories have also received £6m from secretive unincorporated associations, such as dinner clubs, which do not need to declare the identities of their members.
