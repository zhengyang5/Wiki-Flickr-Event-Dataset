Sumon Hoque, 32, appeared Aberdeen Sheriff Court charged with a string of driving offences.
Andrew Milligan/PA Archive/PA ImagesLabour has withdrawn support for a general election candidate who has appeared in court charged with drink driving without a licence.
He is accused of driving a car with no MOT and without a licence while over the drink drive limit.
Mr Hoque was selected as Labour’s candidate for May’s general election in the Banff and Buchan constituency in February.
A spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party said: "Sumon Hoque has been suspended from representing the Labour Party and we have, therefore, withdrawn support from him as the general election candidate."
