The Labour Party has suspended its Wellingborough and Rushden Parliamentary candidate after he was found guilty of fraud after buying train tickets worth almost £900 using a card for a closed bank account.
The account was closed in 2011 when it became £2,000 overdrawn.
Representing himself at Wellingborough Magistrates’ Court today, Garvie said: “I fully accept it was the case that purchases were made using an account that was overdrawn.
During his trial, the court heard he had a previous conviction of travelling on a train without paying in 2008.
“We are in no doubt that you acted dishonestly.”Speaking after the trial, Garvie said: “I dispute that I have done anything wrong.
