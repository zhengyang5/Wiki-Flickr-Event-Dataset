The resilience of the Conservative vote in England cannot purely be a function of short-term campaign tactics.
Certainly the threat of a Labour government propped up by Scottish nationalists – raised relentlessly in the final weeks – will have nudged some undecided voters back into the Tory column.
Labour candidates were reporting that it was one of the only messages from any party that had “cut through” in marginal seats.
In uncertain economic times that seems to have been sufficient to sway large numbers of undecided voters and, crucially, to tip some Ukip-leaning people away from Farage.
Combined, that was Labour’s biggest bruise and Crosby found a well-targeted way to punch it hard.
