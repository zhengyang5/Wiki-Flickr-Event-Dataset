As British voters headed to the polls Thursday, final opinion polls suggested a late surge in support for Labour, but one unlikely to break the deadlock of what is set to be the closest general election the country has seen for decades.
A Guardian/ICM poll based on telephone interviews conducted on Wednesday evening had Labour ahead of the Prime Minister David Cameron’s conservatives by a single point.
“All the final polls are now in, and if any late swing has been present nearly all suggest Labour to have been the beneficiary (to this point),” said ICM.
The Guardian’s ‘poll of polls’ projection, however, had the two main parties tied on 273 seats each.
Under the new rules, an early election can only be held if two-thirds of MPs approve it.
