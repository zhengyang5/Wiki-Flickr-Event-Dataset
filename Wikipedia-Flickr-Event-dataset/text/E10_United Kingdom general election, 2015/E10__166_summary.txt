It is difficult to understand the election expenses scandal without understanding the election strategy that had been unveiled three years before the vote.
The first, the Australian political strategist Lynton Crosby, had overseen the Tories’ 2005 general election campaign and Boris Johnson’s two victories in London mayoral elections.
The second election spending law applies to political parties, and sets much higher limits for their spending on national campaigning during a specified period – roughly a year – before the election.
On the morning of the election, party co-chairs Grant Shapps and Lord Feldman arrived with Mark Clarke and a coach of last-minute campaigners.
The first report into the Conservative party’s election expenses was broadcast by Michael Crick on Channel 4 News in late January 2016.
