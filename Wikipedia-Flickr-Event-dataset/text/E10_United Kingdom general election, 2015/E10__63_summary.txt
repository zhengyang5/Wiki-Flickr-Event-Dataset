Mr Clegg said he would not join a coalition with Labour that required a deal with 40-50 SNP MPs to survive.
Current polls suggest Ed Miliband, the Labour party leader, would need SNP support to secure a Commons majority.
Only if those talks failed would Mr Clegg start negotiations with the leader of the smaller party in the Commons, but he fears that any so-called “coalition of the losers” could lack “legitimacy”.
Labour officials said it was well known that Mr Clegg and allies such as Danny Alexander and David Laws favoured another coalition with the Tories but that “it doesn’t necessarily reflect the views of the Lib Dems”.
