Even worse for Labour, their vote share actually fell among those aged 65+, the highest turnout group, to just one in four.
While the vote share of the two main parties is broadly stable, the pattern of voting for other parties has completely changed.

Both vote Conservative in relatively equal proportions, while women are slightly more likely to vote Labour and less likely to vote UKIP.
Both Conservatives and Labour increased their vote share among BME voters, but remained unchanged among white voters.
