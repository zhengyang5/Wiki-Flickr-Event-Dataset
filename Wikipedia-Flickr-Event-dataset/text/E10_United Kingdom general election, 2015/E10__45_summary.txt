Student Niamh McCarthy is contesting Liverpool Wavertree, where Labourâ€™s Luciana Berger has a 7,000 majority.
Back in 2011, 18-year-old Jake Morrison made headlines when he was elected to the council there, becoming the youngest councillor in the country at the time.
During rehearsals, the cast invented The Really Sound Party, a fictional political party which inspired McCarthy to enter politics for real.
In the unlikely event McCarthy beats Berger, she will become the youngest MP to ever enter office.
This incident and an abandoned plan to stand in the general election notwithstanding, Morrison acknowledges the positive aspects of being in political office at a young age.
