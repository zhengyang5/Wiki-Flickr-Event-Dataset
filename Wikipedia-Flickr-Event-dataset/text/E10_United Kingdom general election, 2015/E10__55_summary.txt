With only 18 days to go, we now think it is likely that Ed Miliband will become Prime Minister this summer.
But perhaps Ukip win as many as four, which would most likely be Clacton, Thanet, Rochester and Thurrock.
Finally, for this to happen, pretty much every marginal race has to go in the Tories and Lib Dems favour.
The maths would change if the Lib Dems can save, say, half their Scottish seats, while Labour win very few.
Could Ukip win likely Labour seats?
