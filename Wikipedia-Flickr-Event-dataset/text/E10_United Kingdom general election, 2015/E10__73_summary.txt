But he said he would agree to a pact to prop up a Tory government in return for an EU referendum before Christmas.
A Tory/UKIP/DUP three-way deal was a "possible scenario" as UKIP and the DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) shared a Eurosceptic position, he added.
'No wiggle room'The UKIP leader said the terms of his deal with the Tories would be "very precise and simple".
He has faced some pressure from sections of the Tory party and the business community to hold an earlier vote.
