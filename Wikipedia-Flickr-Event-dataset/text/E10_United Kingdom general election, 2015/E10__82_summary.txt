Here is our super-Venn diagram showing all the likely combinations of parties that might form a government after the election.
The line of outcomes stretches from a Labour majority on the left to a Conservative majority on the right, with a range of possible combinations of parties in between.
Around the outside we show the five smaller parties likely to have more than one MP or with significant national support.
If there is a hung parliament in which no combination of two or three big parties has a majority, these smaller parties may come into play.
