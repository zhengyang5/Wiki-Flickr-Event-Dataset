I hear that some senior advisers to Ed Miliband are reconciling themselves to the implausibility of a coalition even if there is a hung parliament.
SNPEd Miliband may not have ruled out some kind of pact with the SNP but talk to Scottish Labour MPs and he might as well.
He speaks for all but one of the many Scottish Labour MPs I’ve spoken to and I’ve heard senior shadow cabinet members say they’re hearing the message loud and clear.
SDLPLabour’s sister party, the SDLP, would not go near the Tories and would be a banker for the Labour party in most tight votes.
So, if it’s not a coalition after 2015, we could see “confidence and supply” support, we could see “confidence only” support.
