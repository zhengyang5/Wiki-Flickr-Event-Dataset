It is time for a new approach to UK politics - and for our parties to use our influence to bring about progressive change at Westminster.
â€œLast month we sent this message to the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 - to exclude the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru from general election TV debates would be to wilfully ignore this new political landscape.
All three Westminster parties are committed to slash and burn economics.
In that scenario, Plaid Cymru could hold the balance of power alongside our colleagues in the SNP.
Together, we represent, with the Scottish Green Party, a new way of doing politics, a move away from the business-as-usual model of the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems that no longer represents public opinion.
