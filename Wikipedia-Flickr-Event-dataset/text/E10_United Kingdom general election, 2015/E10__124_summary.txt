But, with less than a week to go and all the major television set pieces behind us, should we be watching out for any late swing?
Indeed, with the Conservatives ahead in numerous recent polls, comparisons with 1992 seem to be ever more frequent in the commentariat.
In particular, we’re seeing more and more talk of “late swing” and the parallels with John Major’s victory in 1992, where he trailed in the polls.
Be wary, therefore, of jumping to premature conclusions about a “late swing” to the Tories in the national polls.
Will these attacks produce a “late swing” for the Conservatives?
