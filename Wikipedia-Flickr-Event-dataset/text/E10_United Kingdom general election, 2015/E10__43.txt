A staggering one in five parliamentary constituencies have no female contenders, according to political website YourNextMP. There are no women standing for election in 126 constituencies out of 650.

Across the whole of the UK there were 955 female and 2,666 male candidates known to be standing for election.

Not even a third of the candidates are women

Only 26.4% of known candidates at the moment are female.

Here's how that looks by party:

Of the headline political parties, UKIP has the worst gender balance, with only 72 of their 599 candidates being female. This works out as 12% of its potential parliamentarians.

The mainstream party that's most equal is the Green Party (including the Scottish Green Party). It's fielding over 200 female candidates. This means that 38% of Green candidates are women.

The Scottish National Party also has a comparatively strong female showing with 35.6% of its 59 candidates being women. Top of the list is Northern Ireland's Alliance Party, with 41.2% of its candidates - 7 out of 17 - being female.

The National Health Action Party has told us that 42% of their candidates are women.

Camberwell and Peckham has the MOST female candidates in the UK

The constituency of Camberwell and Peckham in south London has FIVE women against four men standing to be MP. That's the most female parliamentary candidates of anywhere in the UK.
