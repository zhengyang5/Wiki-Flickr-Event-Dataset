Unlike most MPs, Sir Stuart does not have an office open in the town, and does not hold regular meetings with residents.
Sir Stuart regularly faces criticism from residents who have tried, but failed, to get his help.
Today we speak to one who organised a pre-General Election hustings event last year in which all the candidates - except for Sir Stuart - participated.
“Had we known earlier that Sir Stuart could not make that date, we would have changed it to fit around him,” he said.
Sir Stuart refers to the town on his website, but the entry does not appear to have been updated.
