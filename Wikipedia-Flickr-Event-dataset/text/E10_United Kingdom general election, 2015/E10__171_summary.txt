Getting in touch with Sir Stuart is the hot political talking point on Teesside.
Last night Labour sources said Ed Miliband was treating the allegations against Sir Stuart with the "uttermost seriousness".
Pressure could also be put on Sir Stuart's local party to deselect him.
The latest allegations come after it emerged Sir Stuart had not held a surgery in Middlesbrough for 14 years and does not have a publicly accessible office in the town.
Peter Montellier, acting editor of the Evening Gazette, said the investigation was "most assuredly not politically motivated", but followed complaints from locals who had tried and failed to secure Sir Stuart's help.
