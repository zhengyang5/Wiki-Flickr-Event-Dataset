The Conservatives have had to postpone their plan to water down the fox-hunting ban in England, after the Scottish National Party decided to oppose it, amid a constitutional row.
The Conservatives promised in their election manifesto to give MPs a free vote on repealing the Hunting Act.
At the moment, it does not look like the English votes plan would make any difference at all to a vote on changing the hunting laws.
One political difference would be that the English votes plan would have become law, so the hunting vote would no longer be part of a campaign against it.
Meanwhile the SNP's behaviour will have strengthened Tory resolve to bring in English votes.
