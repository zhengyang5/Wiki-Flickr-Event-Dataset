Other senior Lib Dems to fall were former schools secretary David Laws, former party leader Charles Kennedy and former deputy leader Simon Hughes.
But despite retaining his own parliamentary seat in 2015, he has resigned as Lib Dem leader after disastrous election results saw the party crushed at the polls.
Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown told the BBC he was "immensely proud that we put the national interest first" by forming a coalition in 2010, adding: "We will be back."
Veteran Lib Dem MP of 32 years Simon Hughes lost his Bermondsey and Old Southwark seat in London to Labour's Neil Coyle.
Lib Dem employment minister Jo Swinson lost her East Dunbartonshire seat to the SNP's John Nicolson with a swing of 16%.
