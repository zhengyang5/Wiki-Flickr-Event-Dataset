With only a few weeks to go before the general election, all the parties are undertaking difficult balancing acts.
We know that they have committed to entering negotiations with the party with the largest number of seats in parliament.
I suspect that the Lib Dems will not take such a puritanical approach to negotiations this time round.
The Rose Garden agreement exemplified a political naivety that I suspect we wonâ€™t see from the Lib Dems this time around.
Expect them to bring this experience to bear and come out with some commitments that demonstrate a new, more pragmatic approach to negotiations.
