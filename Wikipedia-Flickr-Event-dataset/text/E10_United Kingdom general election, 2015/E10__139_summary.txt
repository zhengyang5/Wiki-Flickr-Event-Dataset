We have questioned 100,000 people, weighting the data to match both the British electorate and the results of the 2015 general election.
Among people over 50, the Tories have a clear lead among both men (by 12 points) and women (by 15 points).
Public and privateThere is a growing divergence between private and public sector workers.
The Tories led Labour by 17 points among people working in the private sector, while Labour lead by three points among public sector workers.
That 20-point gulf between the two groups has widened from a 16-point gulf in 2010 (16-point Tory lead among private sector workers, level-pegging among public sector workers).
