Ed Miliband is plotting to become Prime Minister even if he wins fewer seats than the Conservatives in this week's election .
However Labour’s Henry McLeish, Scotland’s former first minister, said that in the event of a hung parliament after the election Mr Miliband will "obviously" consider speaking to other parties.
If you prefer me as your Prime Minister to Ed Miliband, then you’ve got to vote Conservative.
“If I’m your preferred prime minister don’t vote Liberal Democrat, you could get Ed Miliband.
Don’t vote Labour, you will definitely get Ed Miliband.”
