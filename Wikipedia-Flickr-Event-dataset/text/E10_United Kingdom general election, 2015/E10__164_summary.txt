Labour has been fined £20,000 by the Electoral Commission, the largest imposed by the body in its history, for undeclared election spending during the 2015 campaign, including more than £7,000 on the so-called “Ed Stone”.
After the commission launched its investigation, the party undertook an internal review, unearthing 24 other undeclared election expenses totalling £109,777.
The commission also found invoices were missing from the Labour party’s return, with 33 bills totalling £34,392 absent from the accounts.
Bob Posner, the commission’s director of party and election finance, said: “The Labour party is a well-established, experienced party.
A Labour party spokeswoman said: “Labour has cooperated fully with the Electoral Commission during its investigation into general election 2015 campaign spending by political parties.
