The current interim government of Mohammed Ghannouchi has announced a ban on the former ruling party of ousted president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.



Tunisia’s new Interior Ministry announced the ban on state television last night. The ban would last until the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD) was dissolved. Ben Ali was ousted from power three weeks ago after a mass uprising. Tunisia suffered clashes between protestors and police last weekend ending with three people dead in the town of Kef.



The town of Kebili also saw violent clashes which ended with one person dead. Mr Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia on January 12 after failing to quell a month long uprising.
