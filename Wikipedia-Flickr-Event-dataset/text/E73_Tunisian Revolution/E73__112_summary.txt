The Tunisian interim government and labor union reached an agreement Tuesday regarding the nomination of new governors, the official TAP reported.
The agreement, which concerns the nomination of new governors with no affiliation to the former ruling party Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), was reached following two negotiation sessions between the government and Tunisian General Union of Labor (UGTT).
UGTT stressed the need to establish a council composed of political parties and civil societies to defense the revolution.
The agreement came in the wake of the resignation of some newly appointed governors who met with violent protests in a number of Tunisian towns.
Many political parties also denounced the nomination of the governors, calling for the appointment of independent figures with no connection with RCD.
