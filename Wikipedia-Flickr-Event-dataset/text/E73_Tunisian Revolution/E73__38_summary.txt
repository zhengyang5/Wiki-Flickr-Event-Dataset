El Général is well built with a buzz cut but with a young, fresh face, a sweet smile and a peach-fuzz beard and moustache.
He says he was heavily influenced by Tupac Shakur, even though he'd died when El Général was just six years old.
(See a video of El General performing "Rais Lebled" the anthem of the Mideast revolutions.)
Only when El Général was released did he realize "Rais Lebled" had become the anthem on the streets.
With the two autocrats overthrown so far, El Général has emerged from the underground to a professional rap career.
