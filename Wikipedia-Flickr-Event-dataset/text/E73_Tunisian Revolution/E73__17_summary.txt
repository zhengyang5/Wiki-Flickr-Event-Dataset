Mr Ben Ali left Tunisia with his family, and has since arrived in Saudi Arabia, officials said.
At the end of a dramatic day, President Ben Ali fled, no longer able to hold back the growing tide of public discontent and anger with his regime.
President Ben Ali, who had already promised to step down in 2014, dissolved his government and the country's parliament, and declared a state of emergency.
Then, in a televised address on Friday afternoon, the prime minister announced that he would be taking over from President Ben Ali.
Mr Ben Ali, 74, was only Tunisia's second president since independence from France in 1956.
