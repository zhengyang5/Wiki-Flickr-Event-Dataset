Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi, Mr. Ben Ali’s former right-hand man, announced the changes in a televised address, but he himself did not resign.
“This is a temporary government with a clear mission — to allow a transition to democracy,” Mr. Ghannouchi said.
From the initial reaction in the streets of Tunis, the capital, protesters welcomed the change, even though Mr. Ghannouchi held on to his position.
The prime minister’s announcement appeared to end a prolonged standoff between the interim government and demonstrators who have besieged his office.
They had vowed not to leave until the government stepped down, and when Mr. Ghannouchi announced the resignations a cheer went up from the crowd.
