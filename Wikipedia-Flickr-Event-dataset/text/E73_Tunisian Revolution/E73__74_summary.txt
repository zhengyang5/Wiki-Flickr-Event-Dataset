Witnesses reported heavy gunfire in Carthage, north of the capital Tunis, where the palace is located.
It comes after the ex-head of presidential security, Ali Seriati, was arrested and accused of threatening state security by fomenting violence.
Hours after Mr Seriati's arrest was announced, heavy gunfire erupted near the presidential palace in the Carthage area.
An eyewitness quoted by Reuters news agency said: "There is firing from around the presidential palace, intensive and continuous."
Mr Ben Ali, who had been in power for 23 years, fled to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a month of mounting protests across the country over unemployment, food price rises and corruption.
