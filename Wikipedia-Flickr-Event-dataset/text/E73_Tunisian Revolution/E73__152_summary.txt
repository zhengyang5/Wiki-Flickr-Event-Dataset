Tunisian bloggers win online media awardPARIS (AP) — Reporters Without Borders on Friday gave its annual award for online media freedom to a Tunisian blogging group — highlighting the role of social media in Arab world uprisings this year.
Tunisia's Nawaat.org won the media watchdog's Google-sponsored euro2,500 ($3,450) Netizen Prize for efforts to promote freedom of expression online.
Nawaat.org played an important role rallying anti-government protesters in Tunisia, where President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime routinely quashed dissent and strictly controlled traditional media.
Protesters shared the images on Facebook and other sites, and encouraged more demonstrations against Ben Ali, which eventually reached the capital, Tunis.
Social networking and other websites were again instrumental in the protests — and increasingly drew the ire of autocratic authorities.
