Tunisia's interior minister on Sunday suspended all activities of the country's former ruling party amid the most serious protests since the country's autocratic ruler fled into exile.
Authorities have been cleaning out traces of the Ben Ali regime, notably eliminating figures connected with the former ruling party â€” but not fast enough for many citizens.
Under Ben Ali's 23 years in power, the party had tentacles in all aspects of Tunisian life.
Among other distrusted entities is the police force, which instilled fear as it carried out the repressive policies of Ben Ali.
The move by the interior minister, ultimately in charge of police, could amount to a double gesture to shore up the "people's revolution" in the eyes of many Tunisians.
