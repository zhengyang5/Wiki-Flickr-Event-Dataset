On Wednesday, another jobless young man in Sidi Bouzid climbed an electricity pole, shouted "no for misery, no for unemployment", then touched the wires and electrocuted himself.
According to one recent study, 25% of male graduates and 44% of female graduates in Sidi Bouzid are without jobs.
One answer they give is that it has gone into the pockets of the Ben Ali family and their associates.
And, more important, how many really believe Ben Ali is the man to lead the country out of its problems?
It's probably just a matter of time before someone else delivers that same message to Ben Ali.
