TUNIS, Tunisia, Jan. 20 (UPI) -- All eight ministers in Tunisia's unity government previously linked with ousted president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali resigned, state television reported Thursday.
The resignations of the Constitutional Democratic Rally, or RCD, members meant the party's once-powerful central committee dissolved because many of its members in the new caretaker coalition government had quit, Tunisie 7 and Tunisie 21 said.
He also said he and interim President Fouad Mebazza had quit the RCD in an attempt to distance themselves from Ben Ali.
Protesters parading outside the former ruling party's headquarters demanded the country break decisively with RCD symbols and structures, The New York Times reported.
The new protests erupted after Mebazza promised a complete "break with the past" in an address carried on state television late Wednesday.
