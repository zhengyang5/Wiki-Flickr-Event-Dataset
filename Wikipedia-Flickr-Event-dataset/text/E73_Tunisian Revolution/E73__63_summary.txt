In a televised address spoken – in a first for the Tunisisan president – in local dialect and not classical Arabic, Ben Ali said: “I repeat now, no presidencies for life.
I refuse to touch the constitution.”The Tunisian constitution states that no one over 75 years of age can run for the presidency.
In his speech, Ben Ali demanded that security forces stop using firearms against protesters.
Ben Ali avoided taking full responsibility for the turmoil in Tunisia, saying that he had been "deceived” by advisors.
It wants to see the end not just of President Ben Ali, but of the whole system," said Geisser.
