For 23 years, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali presided over the most tightly run ship in the Arab world.
Not once in my 43 years have I thought that I'd see an Arab leader toppled by his people.
Ben Ali was elected to a fifth term with 89.62 percent of the vote in 2009.
No doubt, every Arab leader has watched Tunisia's revolt in fear while citizens across the Arab world watch in solidarity, elated at that rarity: open revolution.
"Tunis now: the chants continue 'No to Ben Ali even if we die,' " tweeted a Tunisian who joined the 6,000 to 7,000 protesting outside the Interior Ministry hours before Ben Ali fled.
