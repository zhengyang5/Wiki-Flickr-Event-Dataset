Tunisia asks Saudi Arabia to extradite Ben AliTUNIS â€” Tunisia's interim government on Sunday asked Saudi Arabia to extradite deposed strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali as it faced a second day of protests demanding its resignation.
The caretaker government also asked Saudi Arabia for information about 74-year-old Ben Ali's health following reports this week that he had fallen into a stress-induced coma and was being treated in a hospital in Jeddah.
Two days ago Tunisian officials spurned the reports, saying Ben Ali's health was "not the government's business".
This is Ben Ali's team and it has changed nothing," said teacher Samia Mahfoudh, 50.
Ghannouchi was prime minister under Ben Ali from 1999 until his ouster.
