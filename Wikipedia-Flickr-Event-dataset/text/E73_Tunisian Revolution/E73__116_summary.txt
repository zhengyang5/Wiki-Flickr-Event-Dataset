According to the police, more than 100,000 people, most of them students, were out in Tunis on Friday.They chanted slogans against Ghannouchi as army helicopters circled over-head.The rally is believed to be the biggest of several protests against the transitional authorities since the fall of long-time dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali last month.Protesters want Ghannouchi to hand over power to a civilian government.
Protesters say they do not want any members of the ruling party in the post-revolution government.Demonstrators oppose the new government as it still includes figures from the ousted regime.Ghannouchi had earlier said that he would resign after elections within six months.The revolution that ousted Ben Ali after 23 years in power has sparked off other popular uprisings in North Africa, including one that led to the downfall of long-time Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.JR/HGH/MMN
