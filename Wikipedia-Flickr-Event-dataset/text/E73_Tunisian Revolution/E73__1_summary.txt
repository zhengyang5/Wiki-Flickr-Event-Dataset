Tunisia was thrown into turmoil once more after Mohamed Ghannouchi resigned as prime minister of the post-revolution government amid further clashes between police and protestors.
The interim president, Fouad Mebazaa, named the former government minister Beji Caid-Essebsi as Ghannouchi's replacement.
Ghannouchi said he felt forced to stand down "because I am not willing to be a person that takes decisions that would end up causing casualties".
"This is to open the way for a new prime minister."
Tunisia's revolution was sparked by the death of a young street vendor, Mohammed Bouazizi, in December.
