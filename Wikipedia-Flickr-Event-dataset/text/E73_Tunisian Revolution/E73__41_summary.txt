Lina Ben Mhenni, a Tunisian blogger and university assistant, told Al Jazeera that she heard that two of the lawyers were arrested late on Tuesday.
"They were censored because they wrote about the protests of Sidi Bouzid this week," Ben Mhenni said.
Protests are rare occurrence in Tunisia - which has been run for 23 years by President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and works closely with Western governments to combat al-Qaeda.
"Tunisia has been ruled by Ben Ali for 23 years with an iron fist and this is the first time that he has been challenged by people from various towns," Madani said.
"This morning all the people were talking about Ben Ali being in Dubai, but nobody has the right information," Lina Ben Mhenni said.
