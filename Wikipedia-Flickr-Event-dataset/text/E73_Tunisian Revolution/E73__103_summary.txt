In an address on Tunisian television, Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi announced on Thursday the make- up of the new Tunisian interim government, following a major reshuffle aimed at quieting the grievances of a large number of Tunisians calling for the ousting of former RCD ministers.
In a statement released minutes before the announcement of the reshuffle, the country's powerful labor union (UGTT) said that it will back the new government led by Prime Minister Ghannouchi.
Since the announcement of the first interim government 10 days ago, thousands of Tunisian staged demonstrations protesting against what they viewed as a government dominated by too many former RCD ministers.
"Twelve ministers have been replaced while 9 remain in post," said Ghannouchi, who urged Tunisians to return to work and to resume normal life.
It was an surprising appointment of Elyes Jouini, a high-level economist living in France, in the position of minister delegate to the prime minister, in charge of administrative and economic reform.
