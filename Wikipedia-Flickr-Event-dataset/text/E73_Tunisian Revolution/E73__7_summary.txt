An independent commission charged with investigating abuses committed during the January 2011 uprising that ousted Tunisia's longtime dictator has identified more deaths and injuries than previously reported.
Saturday's report says there were 338 deaths and 2,147 injuries.
Previous estimates were of 300 dead and 700 wounded during the revolution, which inspired similar revolts in Egypt and Libya.
The report says 66 percent of those killed were shot, and concludes that responsibility for the violence rests primarily with ousted President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
The commission's report followed a 15-month investigation led by human rights lawyer Taoufik Bouberbala.
