Italy is struggling to cope with a flood of refugees escaping political upheaval in Tunisia, with around 6,000 crossing the sea to the tiny island of Lampedusa in the last week.
Another 2,000 remain on the tiny outcrop, which lies in between Africa and Italy, housed in a re-opened holding centre.
"I will ask the Tunisian foreign minister for authorisation so an Italian contingent can intervene to block the influx.
Italy's foreign minister has since said that the two countries share a "common interest" in curbing the traffic, and offered "logistical help in terms of police and equipment".
"It is a sobering thought that despite all the euphoria over the political reforms in Tunisia the legacy there is grinding poverty."
