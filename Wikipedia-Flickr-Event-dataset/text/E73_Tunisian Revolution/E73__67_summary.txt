Ousted Tunisian President Zine al-Abedine Ben Ali arrived in Saudi Arabia early on Saturday after weeks of anti-government unrest in his North African country.
Ben Ali had also dismissed the government and called for early legislative elections to be held within six months.
Hundreds of demonstrators also took to the streets outside the capital, in places like Sidi Bouzid and Gafsa, where anti-authority chants such as “Ben Ali, get out” could be heard.
