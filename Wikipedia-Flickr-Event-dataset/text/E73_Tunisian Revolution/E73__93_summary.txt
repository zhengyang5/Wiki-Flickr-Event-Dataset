Protesters continue to vent their anger against Ben Ali and members of his former regime [Reuters]Tunisians have begun a three-day period of national mourning for those who died during the month-long uprising that overthrew longtime ruler Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Protests in Tunisia have continued even after Ben Ali fled the country on December 14, and a new interim government offered major concessions.
Rachid al-Ghannouchi, the exiled head of al-Nahda, told Al Jazeera earlier this week that he plans to return to Tunisia.

For the first time since the fall of Ben Ali, there were also protests in other towns across Tunisia.
