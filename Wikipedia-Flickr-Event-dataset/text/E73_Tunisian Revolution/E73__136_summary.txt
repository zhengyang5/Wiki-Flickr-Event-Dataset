The ousting of Tunisia's president after violent protests is a stark warning to authoritarian regimes across the Arab world, whose people have long voiced similar grievances, analysts said on Saturday.
Tunisia's "Jasmine Revolution," as it has been dubbed, "is the first popular uprising to succeed in removing a president in the Arab world," said Amr Hamzawy of the Carnegie Middle East Centre based in Beirut.
"It could be quite inspiring for the rest of the Arab world."
"Politics in the Middle East often spills over with much speed and ease because of porous borders and shared cultures," said Bilal Saab, a researcher at the University of Maryland.
According to Claire Spencer, who heads the Middle East and North Africa Program in Chatham House in London, a peaceful spread of democratisation is not a given.
