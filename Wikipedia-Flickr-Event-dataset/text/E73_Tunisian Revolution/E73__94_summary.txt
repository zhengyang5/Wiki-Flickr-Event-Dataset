Tunisian opposition leader Moncef Marzouki returned from exile today following the ouster of strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the official TAP news agency reported.
"The opposition leader Moncef Marzouki, head of the banned Congress for the Republic (CPR) party, returned to Tunisia after years of exile in Paris," the report said.
He called on Saudi Arabia to give Ben Ali up and said the president's RCD party should be broken up, the report added.
He also said he wanted to travel immediately to Sidi Bouzid -- the city in central Tunisia where protests against Ben Ali's regime kicked off last month.
Marzouki has said he wants to run in a planned presidential election.
