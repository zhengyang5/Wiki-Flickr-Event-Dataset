The 2010â€“2011 Tunisian protests are ongoing fatal[2] demonstrations over unemployment, corruption,[citation needed] and poor living conditions in the Maghreb country, which began in December 2010. Protests are rare[3] in Tunisia and these protests constitute the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in three decades.[4]

Riots on 18 December in Sidi Bouzid went largely unnoticed though social media sites like Facebook and Youtube featured images of police dispersing youths who attacked shop windows and damaged cars. One protester, Mohamed Bouazizi, set himself alight in protest against the confiscation of his fruit and vegetable cart. He was subsequently transferred to a hospital in Tunis where he died on 4 January.[5]

This came despite media networks pointing out that riots in Tunisia were rare as it was generally considered stable in its region and amongst the wealthiest. Al Jazeera English also said that Tunisian activists are amongst the most outspoken in its part of the world with various messages of support being posted on Twitter for Bouazizi.[6] An op-ed article in the same network said of the action that it was "suicidal protests of despair by Tunisia's youth." It pointed out that the state-controlled National Solidarity Fund and the National Employment Fund had traditionally subsidisied many goods and services in the country but had started to shift the "burden of providence from state to society" to be funded by the "bidon-villes"[clarification needed] around the richer town and suburbs.[clarification needed] It also cited the "marginalization of the agrarian and arid central and southern areas [that] continue unabated."[7] The protests were also called an "uprising" because of "a lethal combination of poverty, unemployment and political repression: three characteristics of most Arab societies."[8]
