The official Tunisian news agency said the crowd had turned on police after the police chief "abused" a member of the community.
A local journalist said the police chief slapped a woman during a demonstration, triggering the violence between police and citizens.
The crowd burned two cars, one a police vehicle, a ministry statement said.
Police fired tear gas, then fired into the air in a vain effort to disperse the crowd, then began firing on demonstrators, the Interior Ministry said.
The ministry confirmed the police chief was under arrest and said investigators had been sent to Kef.
