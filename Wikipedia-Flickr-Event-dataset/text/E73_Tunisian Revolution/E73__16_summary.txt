Mr. Bouazizi, a fruit vendor, set himself on fire in front of the local governor’s office after the authorities confiscated his fruit, beat him and refused to return his property.
He is now seen as the instigator of a revolution that forced out President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali after 23 years of authoritarian rule.
PhotoOne striking feature of the passionate discussion about Mr. Bouazizi and his imitators — at least for Westerners — is the relative absence of religion.
Most Americans are used to hearing about Muslim suicide bombers who are impelled in part by the promise of salvation.
The recent Arab self-immolators appear to have been motivated more by anger and despair at their social and economic plight.
