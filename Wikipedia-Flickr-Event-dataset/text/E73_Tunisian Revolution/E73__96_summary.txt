Later in the day, some police officers joined protesters in a march towards the prime minister's office, Al Jazeera's Nazinine Moshiri said.
Protests in Tunisia have continued even after Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia on December 14 and the new interim government offered major concessions.
However, Al Jazeera's Moshiri said it was difficult to ascertain the number of detainees in the first place.
The transitional cabinet decided to recognise all banned political parties and agreed on a general amnesty for all political prisoners.
Rachid al-Ghannouchi, the exiled head of al-Nahda, told Al Jazeera earlier this week that he plans to return to Tunisia.
