While the rumours are still swirling, one thing is clear, Ben Ali has left Tunisia and the army has stepped in.
The day began with a mass demonstration called by Tunisia's trade union federation, the UGTT, in the capital Tunis.
The army seized control of the airport and there were reports of convoys of limousines racing to the airport from the Ben Ali families palace.
Ben Ali is gone.
Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi appeared on state TV to announce that he was in charge of a caretaker government backed by the army.
