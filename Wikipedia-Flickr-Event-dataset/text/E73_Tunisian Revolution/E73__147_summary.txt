In cities across the Arab world, people have been reinvigorated by the Tunisian uprising [EPA]The Tunisian uprising, which succeeded in toppling Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the Tunisian president, has brought down the walls of fear, erected by repression and marginalisation, thus restoring the Arab peoples' faith in their ability to demand social justice and end tyranny.
But the Tunisian intifada has placed the Arab world at a crossroads.
If it fully succeeds in bringing real change to Tunis it will push the door wide open to freedom in Arab word.
But Tunis, under Ben Ali, was not a model of secularism but a shameless model of tyranny.
But it has already empowered people across the Arab world to expose the fallacy of regimes that believe adopting a pro-Western agenda will enable them to fool their people and guarantee their longevity.
