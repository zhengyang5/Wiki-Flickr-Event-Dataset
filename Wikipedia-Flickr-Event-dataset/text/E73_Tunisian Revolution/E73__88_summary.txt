Tunisia's caretaker prime minister was battling tonight to convince the nation that the interim government could lead the transition to democracy, after four opposition members quit in protest.
Three ministers in the important opposition UGTT trade union quit, including transport and labour ministers, saying they had "no confidence" in a government that still featured members of the RCD party that ruled under Ben Ali.
Then the health minister, Mustapha Ben Jafaar, head of the FTDL opposition party, quit for the same reason.
But tweaks to the coalition "unity" government could take place in the coming days, and the prime minister wants to be seen to be talking to all opposition parties.
At the headquarters of the PDP opposition party, members of the party's executive committee held what one source called "very intense discussions" this afternoon but decided to stay in the government.
