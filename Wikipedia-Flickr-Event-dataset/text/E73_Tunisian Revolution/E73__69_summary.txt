The Saudi government welcomed Ben Ali on Friday, ushering him to a heavily guarded palace in Jeddah [AFP]Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia's former president, has taken refuge in Saudi Arabia following a mass public uprising and weeks of deadly protests.
It was certainly "not out of sympathy" for Ben Ali, Mustafa Alani, research director at Dubai's Gulf Research Centre, said.
"Ben Ali is not the first one," he said, pointing out that Habib Bourguiba, the man Ben Ali deposed as Tunisia's president in 1987, and Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Algeria's current president, had also sought refuge in Saudi Arabia in the past.
Alkhamis said "many of the other fugitives ... [have] been in Saudi Arabia before, with welcome from the Saudi government.
But Alkhamis said it would be naïve to ignore that actual reason behind Saudi’s hospitality - "the strong relationship between Ben Ali and the royal family of Saudi Arabia", as well as the security relationship between Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.
