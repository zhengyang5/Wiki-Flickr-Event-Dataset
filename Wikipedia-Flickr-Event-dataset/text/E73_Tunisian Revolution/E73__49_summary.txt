In his speech on Tuesday, Ben Ali criticised the "use of violence in the streets by a minority of extremists" and said the law would be applied "in all firmness" to punish protesters.
The public defiance marks a rare display of a popular anger against Ben Ali, who has been in power for 23 years.
Protests are rare occurrence in Tunisia, where Ben Ali works closely with Western governments to combat al-Qaeda.
"This morning all the people were talking about Ben Ali being in Dubai, but nobody has the right information," Lina Ben Mhenni said.
"I just heard that the president is going to talk on TV tonight - I'm not sure but this what I heard."
