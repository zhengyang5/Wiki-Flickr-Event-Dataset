Youtube video purportedly showing the protest in Sidi Bouzid, southwest of TunisRiots are extremely rare for Tunisia, a North African country of about 10 million people.
Witnesses said several hundred youths gathered in the city of Sidi Bouzid, about 200km southwest of the capital Tunis, late on Saturday.
Witnesses said hundreds of extra security forces had been brought into Sidi Bouzid on Sunday and had established a heavy presence on the streets.
"Let's hope that this event in Sidi Bouzid isn't limited to Bouazizi's health ... this is only the begining!!!"
@C-Moii said she only learned about Saturday's events from an Algerian friend, and that her friends in Tunisia were unaware of what had happened in Sidi Bouzid.
