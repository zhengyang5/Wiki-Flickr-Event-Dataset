Tunisian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi has pledged to leave Tunisian politics after the country holds elections following the ouster of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.
Speaking in an interview on Tunisian television on January 21, Ghannouchi also promised that "all undemocratic laws" would be scrapped during what he described as a transition to democracy in Tunisia.
Ghannouchi further pledged to organize transparent and democratic elections within six months -- but did not mention any date for a poll.
The prime minister, who was an ally of Ben Ali, also claimed that he had been "afraid, like all Tunisians," during the 23 years of Ben Ali's rule.
Ben Ali fled in disgrace to Saudi Arabia on January 14 after weeks of sometimes deadly demonstrations against his regime, and protesters say all figures linked to his rule should now leave power.
