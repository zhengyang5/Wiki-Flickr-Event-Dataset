France welcomes the announcement by the Tunisian government’s spokesperson of the endorsement of major international commitments relating to human rights.

This announcement represents a milestone for Tunisia and serves as a model for the region.

By announcing its forthcoming accession to the International Convention on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court, the Optional Protocol to the International Convention against Torture, and the two Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Tunisia affirms its determination to combat serious human rights violations, to put an end to impunity, to cooperate fully with the UN organs that monitor the implementation of the treaties and to authorize them to examine complaints made by citizens.

It is also the first country in the region to consider abolishing the death sentence, which is the subject of the 2nd Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

France, together with its EU partners, stands ready to help Tunisia - if it wishes - to implement these legal instruments.

The Ministre d’Etat is at this very moment speaking on the telephone with her Tunisian counterpart. This is their second telephone conversation since Mr. Ahmed Abderraouf Ounaïs’s appointment.
