Amamou is the CEO of a web development company and calls himself a "partisan of the neutrality of the net".
A member of the Pirate party, inspired by the Swedish movement, he has been active on the underground blogger's circuit for many years.
While Amamou and his fellow bloggers, such as "A Tunisian Girl", spread news of the protests and brutal police repression, the state clamped down with its sophisticated counter-technology.
For him, Tunisia's biggest problems were freedom of information and a justice system which was totally controlled by the regime.
Amamou said he won't resign from government just because others have done so over the presence of the ruling RCD party and that there shouldn't be an "automatic rejection" of every member of the RCD.
