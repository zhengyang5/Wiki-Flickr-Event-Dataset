I am incredibly saddened and deeply enraged to report that my good friend Slim Amamou, Tunisian blogger and activist, was arrested yesterday (see @Malekkâ€™s announcement here).
After no one had heard from him for several hours, Slim posted his location to FourSquare to let his friends know where he was.
I met Slim in December 2009 in Beirut, at the 2nd Arab Bloggers Workshop organized by Global Voices Advocacy and the Heinrich Boll foundation.
When I cried like an idiot at the end of the conference, Slim was the first to come over and hug me.
Last month, he was invited to speak at Yale and lucky for me, visited Cambridge for the afternoon.
