FRANCE 24 went back to Redeyef, where the Tunisian revolution was already brewing in 2008...

Redeyef, situated 350 km south of Tunis, is a small town devoted to mining in a phosphate-rich region.

In 2008, there was an open call to apply for jobs at the Gafsa Phosphate Company.

But the competition was rigged, and the jobs were given to supporters of then-president Ben Ali.

Accusations flew and people became increasingly angry.

Months of protests followed, resulting in four deaths and numerous arrests.

The government did all it could to stifle the unrest.

We decided to go back to Redeyef, but this time after the fall of Ben Ali.
