Tunisian interim President Fouad Mebazaa said Thursday an election is expected on July 24 to form a constitutional council.
In an address broadcast on Tunisian television, the caretaker president said he would not resign on March 15 and will remain in office until the election of the country's first constitutional council.
Setting up a constitutional council has been one of the main demands of a number of protesters, political parties and others.
Meanwhile, the interim president said new caretaker Prime Minister Beji Caid Essebsi will soon appoint ministers to replace those resigned earlier this week.
