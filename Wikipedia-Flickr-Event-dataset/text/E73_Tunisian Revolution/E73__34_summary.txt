Tunisia has blocked the website of a Lebanese newspaper that published US cables released by WikiLeaks describing high-level corruption, a sclerotic regime, and deep hatred of President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali's wife and her family.
"The problem is clear," wrote ambassador Robert Godec in July 2009, in a secret dispatch released by Beirut's al-Akhbar newspaper.
And, while President Ben Ali deserves credit for continuing many of the progressive policies of President Bourguiba, he and his regime have lost touch with the Tunisian people.
(El Materi had recently helped the British ambassador to secure several appointments for the Duke of York, who was visiting to promote UK trade.)
The El Materi household includes a large tiger, named Pasha, living in a cage, which consumes four chickens a day.
