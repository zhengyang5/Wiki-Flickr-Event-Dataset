A man puts up an electoral poster of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunis.
One Tunisia expert describes the current situation well here.
The regime has no real alternatives except members of Ben Ali’s family, a solution unlikely to satisfy Tunisian society.
Tunisia, whose literacy rate has long been the highest in Africa at nearly 80 percent and whose per capita GDP is about $8,000, should have the ability to sustain a democratic government—once the Ben Ali regime collapses.
If Tunisia can move toward democracy, Algerians and Egyptians and even Libyans will wonder why they cannot.
