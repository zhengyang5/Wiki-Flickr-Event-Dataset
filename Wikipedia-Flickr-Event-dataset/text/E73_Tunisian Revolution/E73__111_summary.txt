Tunisian lawmakers approve emergency powersTUNIS â€” Tunisian lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Monday to give the interim government emergency powers following the suspension of ousted leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's party.
The Senate is to vote on the bill Wednesday before it can be ratified by interim president Foued Mebazaa.
As lawmakers debated the bill, hundreds of demonstrators massed outside to demand the "dissolution of parliament", known as the long-feared RDC's former power base.
Sunday, interior minister Fahrat Rajhi announced the suspension of all activities of the RCD as a first step towards its dissolution.
By Monday calm was restored in the town with soldiers patrolling the streets, local union official Raouf Hadaoui told AFP by telephone from Tunis.
