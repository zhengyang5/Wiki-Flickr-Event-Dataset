TUNIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Tunisia’s interior minister has decided that all activities of former ruling party the RCD will be suspended to prevent a breakdown in security, state television and an interior ministry source said on Sunday.
“The minister of the interior has decided to suspend all activities and all meetings of the RCD and to close down all its offices pending a judicial decision on its dissolution,” said the source, who did not want to be identified.
