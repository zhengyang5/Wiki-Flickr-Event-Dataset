Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on Thursday sacked the governor of the restive Sidi Bouzid region, a day after firing his communications minister in a reshuffle following violent protests.

Sidi Bouzid governor Mourad Ben Jalloul was replaced by Abdelhamid Aloui, state TAP news agency said without giving a reason for his removal.

Ben Ali said on Tuesday he was concerned by recent tension in the central Sidi Bouzid region, which has been linked to the high youth unemployment rate.

Tensions flared on December 17 when a 26-year-old man who was selling fruit and vegetables on the streets set himself on fire after police confiscated his produce.

One protestor died in clashes between mostly unemployed youths and government security forces on December 24.

The governors of the northwestern Jendouba and northeastern Zaghouan regions have also removed.

Communications minister Oussama Romdhani who since 1995 headed the communications sector as chief executive of the country's Atce public relations agency has so far been the most visible victim of the ongoing reshuffle.

Romdhani was replaced by youth and sports minister Samir Laabidi.
