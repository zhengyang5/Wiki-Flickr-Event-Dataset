On Dec. 17, a young fruit seller set himself on fire in front of the Sidi Bouzid regional council in central Tunisia.
Exactly four weeks later Mohamed Bouazizi’s act of desperation toppled the repressive regime that had ruled for 23 years.
His uncle had bought a small farm in R’gueb, near Sidi Bouzid, but the farm was one of those shut down due to corrupt land appropriations in the region.
So Mohamed was forced to return to Sidi Bouzid to try to earn a living selling fruit and vegetables in the street.
But Mohamed had no other option to try to make a living, and he bought his merchandise by getting into debt.
