Tunisian interim President Fouad Mebazaa and Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi resigned from the ruling party, state media announced Tuesday just hours after several ministers quit over the inclusion of party members in the new government.
Tunisiaâ€™s transitional president and prime minister resigned from the ruling RCD (Democratic Constitutional Rally) party Tuesday, hours after several ministers quit the national unity government in protest over the inclusion of senior ruling party members in the new administration.
A technocrat and close Ben Ali associate, Ghannouchi served as acting president for a day following Ben Ali's ouster.
Hours later, Health Minister Mustapha Ben Jaafar of the FDLT opposition party also announced his resignation.
Tunisia's banned Islamist Ennahdha movement is also planning to request official status as a political party, one of its leaders told the AFP Tuesday.
