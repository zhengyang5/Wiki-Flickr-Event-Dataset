Now even the Tunisian police are protesting on the streetsPrime Minister promises to resign as soon as possibleProtesters back on streets as three-day mourning period for victims endsAs a further sign of chaos and the erosion of authority in Tunisia, the country's once-feared police force has staged a rally of its own.
The protest marks a turning point in the Tunisian uprising, throughout which Ben Ali loyalists in the police force fired on crowds, beat protesters with batons and shot teargas even at relatively small and peaceful gatherings.
The rally took place near the hulking Interior Ministry, a symbol of the dread that his regime inspired for many Tunisians.
The crowd in Avenue Bourguiba, where daily protests have been held, drew many plain-clothed and uniformed police with red armbands.
Tunisians interviewed in recent weeks have said repeatedly that they feared the interior ministry's officers the most.
