TUNIS (Reuters) - A young Tunisian whose attempted suicide by self-immolation sparked a rare wave of violent protests in several areas of the country died on Tuesday of his injuries, his relatives said.
Mohammed Bouazizi, 26, set fire to himself last month in front of a government building in the central town of Sidi Bouzid to protest against the confiscation by police of his fruit and vegetable cart.
Tunisia has been ruled for the last 23 years by Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who works closely with Western governments to combat al Qaeda militants.
The government has accused its opponents of manipulating the Sidi Bouzid clashes last month to discredit the authorities, and Ben Ali said that violent protests were unacceptable and would hurt national interests.
The wave of protests had died down after Ben Ali named a new youth minister in a minor government reshuffle — the second in 2010 — and a new governor for Sidi Bouzid.
