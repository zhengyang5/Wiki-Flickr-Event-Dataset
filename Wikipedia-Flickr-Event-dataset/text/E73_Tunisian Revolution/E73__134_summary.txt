TUNIS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Tunisian minister for Planning and International Cooperation Mohamed Nouri Jouini resigned on Monday, the official TAP news agency reported, hours after another minister also stepped down.
In a statement posted on its Internet site, the Tunis stock exchange said it was suspending all operations with immediate effect “in view of the current situation and with the aim of protecting savings invested in equities.” (Reporting by Tarek Amara; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Myra MacDonald)
