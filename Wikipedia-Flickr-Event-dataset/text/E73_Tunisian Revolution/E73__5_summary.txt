TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia’s election will be delayed until October 23, a week later than the date suggested by electoral officials, to ensure it can be “free and transparent,” Prime Minister Beji Caid Sebsi said on Wednesday.

Large opposition parties have demanded an earlier poll, saying they fear the government may renege on its promise to lead Tunisia toward democracy after the overthrow of former president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali this year.
“All things considered, we decided to hold the elections on October 23,” Sebsi told reporters after meeting government officials in the capital of the North African country.
There are parties who disagreed with this ... but our mission is to hold elections that are free and transparent.
