The Nobel Peace Prize 2015National Dialogue Quartet Share this:The Nobel Peace Prize for 2015The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2015 is to be awarded to the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet for its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution of 2011.
It established an alternative, peaceful political process at a time when the country was on the brink of civil war.
The Nobel Peace Prize for 2015 is awarded to this Quartet, not to the four individual organizations as such.
The National Dialogue Quartet must be given much of the credit for this achievement and for ensuring that the benefits of the Jasmine Revolution have not been lost.
