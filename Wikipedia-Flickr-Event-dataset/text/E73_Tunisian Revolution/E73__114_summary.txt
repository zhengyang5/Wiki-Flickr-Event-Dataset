France welcomes the announcement by the Tunisian government’s spokesperson of the endorsement of major international commitments relating to human rights.
This announcement represents a milestone for Tunisia and serves as a model for the region.
It is also the first country in the region to consider abolishing the death sentence, which is the subject of the 2nd Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
France, together with its EU partners, stands ready to help Tunisia - if it wishes - to implement these legal instruments.
The Ministre d’Etat is at this very moment speaking on the telephone with her Tunisian counterpart.
