Image caption Mohammed Bouazizi (R) was visited by the president before his deathA Tunisian graduate whose attempted suicide set off violent protests over unemployment across the North Africa nation has died.
Mohammed Bouazizi, 26, sold fruit and vegetables illegally in Sidi Bouzid because he could not find a job.
Mr Bouazizi died on Tuesday afternoon in a hospital outside the capital, Tunis.
A massive police presence prevented the crowd from reaching the governor's office, outside which Mr Bouazizi had set himself alight, his uncle, Mehdi Horchani, told AFP.
But the president, who visited Mr Bouazizi in hospital before his death, said that he would seek to find a solution to the problem of unemployment - and has since appointed a new youth minister.
