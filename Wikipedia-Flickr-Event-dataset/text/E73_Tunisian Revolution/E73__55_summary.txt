Two web activists, Slim Amamou and Azyz Amamy, have not been heard from since Thursday, sources in Tunisia told Al Jazeera.
The arrests come in the context of a "cyberwar" between the Tunisian authorities and web activists, who have been struggling to break through the countryâ€™s extensive censorship wall.
International web activists from Anonymous have launched "distributed denial of service" (DDoS) attacks on government-linked websites during the past week.
'Muffling discontent'Local journalists are facing violence and arrest as they try to cover the "unprecedented" protests that began on December 17.
The protests have grown into the most widespread and violent flare-up of dissent of Ben Ali's 23-year rule.
