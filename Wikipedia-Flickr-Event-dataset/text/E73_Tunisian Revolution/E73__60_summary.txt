The situation took a turn for the worse this week when several net activists, bloggers and members of The Pirate Party were arrested for reasons unknown.
Another activist and critic of the Government who suffered the same fate is Azyz Amami, a member of the local Pirate Party.
Slim Amamou and Slah Eddine Kchouk, both graduate students and members of the Pirate Party of Tunisia like Amami, were also arrested by the authorities.
The Tunisian Pirate Party is outraged by the arrests of its members and has posted an appeal for more attention to the growing repression.
A few hours ago the international umbrella organization for Pirate Parties – Pirate Parties International – also released a public statement condemning the unjust arrests of Pirate Party members and free speech activists.
