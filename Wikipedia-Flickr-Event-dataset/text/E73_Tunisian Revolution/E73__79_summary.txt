Evgeny Morozov is the most die-hard opponent of the idea that social media can bring about positive social change poses another counterfactual: what if it had failed?
Then what would be the contribution of social media?
“To be healthy,” we say, and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause [the final cause].
So, I think most of the people using the term “social media revolution” are using it in the sense of a material cause.
However, as a material cause, as a key part of the media and information substrate in which the events took place, it seems clear to me that social media was crucial.
