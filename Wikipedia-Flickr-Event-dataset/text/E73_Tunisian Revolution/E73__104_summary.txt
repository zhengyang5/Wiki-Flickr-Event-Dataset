A week on, protesters from Tunisia’s rural interior have taken over the seat of government, setting up tents and distributing food to support their 24-hour sit-in.
“The dictatorship in Tunisia continues and we will confront this until we have democracy ... Ghannouchi’s silence is evidence of his collaboration,” he said.
Sitting on mats and blankets beneath a tarpaulin, groups of protesters discuss whether to stay or go.
Barbed wire, soldiers and police stop protesters from reaching the casbah or old city.
Judges, lawyers and others arrived in their robes to try to persuade the protesters into ending their sit-in.
