They have deleted a few pages in which I was writing about the public protests," Ben Mhenni said.
Students in the town of Sidi Bouzid held a protest that went ahead without any problems, AFP news agency reported.
"The lawyers protested for Sidi Bouzid again, but also because of the violence that they experienced at the demonstration last week," Ben Mhenni said.
Mohamed Ben Madani, an analyst with the Maghreb Review, told Al Jazeera that events last week were extraordinary for Tunisia.
Also on Monday, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas met with Ben Ali at the Carthage presidential palace in the suburbs of Tunis.
