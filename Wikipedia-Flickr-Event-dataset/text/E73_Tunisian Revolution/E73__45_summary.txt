The overwhelming majority of Tunisia's lawyers joined a national strike against police violence [AFP]Thousands of Tunisian lawyers have gone on strike to demand an end to what they said were beatings by security forces, the latest civil disobedience in a protest movement that has led to unprecedented unrest.
"The strike carries a clear message that we do not accept unjustified attacks on lawyers," he said.
"We want to strongly protest against the beating of lawyers in the past few days."
Protests have been rare in Tunisia, which has had only two presidents since independence from France 55 years ago.
Amnesty International condemned the Tunisian authorities' repression of the wave of protests on Thursday.
