Tunisian caretaker Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi said a general amnesty will be officially proclaimed by the end of this week, the official press agency TAP reported Friday.



The proclamation of a general amnesty law is one of the Tunisian government's first moves, Ghannouchi said in an interview to the country's three television channels.



The Tunisian parliament recently passed a law which grants the interim president extended powers to proclaim laws decided by the government.



He also announced to soon establish a body to regulate the country's information industry and audio visual products, as is the case in developed countries.



"It is important that the information sector remains free and independent," said Ghannouchi.



Some 10,000 people lost jobs as their factories were burnt down or closed during the unrest across the country, the prime minister said, adding that the issue of pay hikes is still under negotiation between the government and Tunisian National Labor Union.



"The revolution is not about wage increases, but about dignity and freedom," said Ghannouchi.
