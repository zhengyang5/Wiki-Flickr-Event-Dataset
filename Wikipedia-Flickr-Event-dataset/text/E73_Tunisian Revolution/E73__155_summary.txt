A Tunisian man has died after police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of supporters of the group Ansar al-Sharia who defied a government ban of the group's annual.
Members of the Salafist group clashed with police in the Tunis suburb of Ettadhamen, and in the historic city of Kairouan, south of Tunis on Sunday.
An annual congress for the group was due to take place there before it was banned on security grounds.
Moez Dahmani, a 27-year-old man participating in the protest was killed in the clashes with the police, said the state news agency.
"There were hundreds [of protesters] this morning, but right now I can only see a few groups hear and there.
