Bobby Labonte gets Daytona 500 ride after future was in doubtBobby Labonte will race with Phoenix Racing for the 2014 Daytona 500.
Phoenix Racing, for whom Labonte drove part-time in 2010, announced Tuesday it will field a second entry at Daytona for the veteran driver.
"I am grateful and excited to return to Daytona with Phoenix Racing," Labonte said.
"The Daytona 500 is obviously a special event for everyone involved in the sport.
There is no guarantee Labonte will make the race because a second car for Phoenix Racing would not have any owner points.
