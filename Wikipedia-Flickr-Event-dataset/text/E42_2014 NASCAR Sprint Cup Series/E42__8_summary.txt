RICHMOND, Va. -- Hendrick Motorsports locked crew chiefs Alan Gustafson and Chad Knaus into long-term contract extensions Friday that keep two of the sport's top innovators at NASCAR's top organization.
Meanwhile, crew chief Steve Letarte said he's in discussion with team owner Rick Hendrick to extend his contract, too.
Letarte, in the final year of his current deal, said he wants to return as Jeff Gordon's crew chief.
"I've spoken with Mr. Hendrick, and he's told me his intentions, and he wants me to crew chief here and I want to crew chief here," Letarte said before qualifying at Richmond International Raceway.
But Gustafson, currently the crew chief for Mark Martin, dodged what his role will be.
