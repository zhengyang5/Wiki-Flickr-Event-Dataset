HOMESTEAD, Fla. -- Four-time Sprint Cup champion Jeff Gordon will drive through at least the 2013 season for Hendrick Motorsports, team owner Rick Hendrick said Friday.
There has been speculation that Gordon, who has a lifetime deal with HMS, will retire within the next couple of years.
Hendrick said he's also negotiating a new deal with DuPont, the primary sponsor on Gordon's car since he entered the Sprint Cup Series in 1992.
Hendrick added that he's working on a lifetime deal for Chad Knaus, the crew chief for Jimmie Johnson, who on Friday agreed to a five-year extension through 2015.
"This has been a fantastic ride with Jimmie," Hendrick said.
