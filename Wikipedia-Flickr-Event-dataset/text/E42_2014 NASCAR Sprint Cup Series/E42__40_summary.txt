A victory at Talladega Superspeedway launched Brad Keselowski’s Sprint Cup Series career.
When the weekend started, I thought we had the opportunity to do that,” said Keselowski, who now has 16 career wins.
“My own expectations or goals are to make the most of that opportunity and win races, win championships.
We’ve done that with race wins.
At the same time, however, the move also helped Kenseth – one of the drivers in danger of being eliminated entering the race – finish second and advance.
