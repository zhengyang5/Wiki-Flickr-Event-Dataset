DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Three-wide racing during practice Wednesday led to a wild multicar crash at Daytona International Speedway.
The crash resulted in Parker Kligerman's Swan Racing car getting lifted off the ground and flipping upside-down.
The crash began when Joey Logano appeared to hit Matt Kenseth — the same two drivers who caused a big crash in Saturday's Sprint Unlimited.
That crash sent car parts and debris flying into the grandstands, injuring more than 30 fans.
Logano, Kligerman, Menard and Ryan Truex will have to go to backups after the big crash.
