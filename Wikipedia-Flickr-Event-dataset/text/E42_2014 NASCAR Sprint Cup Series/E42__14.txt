There's one less seat available for NASCAR's Silly Season.

Paul Menard, driver of Richard Childress Racing's No. 27 entry with sponsorship from his family's home improvement store, has signed a "multi-year" deal to remain with the team, RCR announced Friday afternoon.

Menard's contract with RCR had been set to expire after the season, along with the sponsor deal from the Menards stores.

"He has shown his ability to be consistent, competitive and win on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series level," team owner Richard Childress said. "He did that in the Brickyard 400 with us at Indy. Having (crew chief) Slugger Labbe and the entire crew coming back gives us something to build on to win more races, make the Chase and contend for a championship."

Soft-spoken Menard, 32, isn't known as being a regular contender on the Sprint Cup Series circuit — his 2011 Brickyard win is his only victory — but he's become more consistent over the course of his career.

This season, he's 10th in the point standings, inside a Chase spot for now, with four top-10 finishes in 11 races.

"Being part of a family-owned and operated business, I can relate to the team's goals and objectives," Menard said. "We will continue to grow together and build our relationship, achieving even greater accomplishments in the future."
