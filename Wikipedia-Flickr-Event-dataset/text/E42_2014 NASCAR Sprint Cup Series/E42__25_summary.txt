Denny Hamlin will miss Sunday's Sprint Cup Series race at Auto Club Speedway because of a sinus infection that is affecting his vision, according to Joe Gibbs Racing president JD Gibbs.
Gibbs made the announcement approximately 30 minutes before the green flag of Sunday's race.
Sam Hornish Jr., driving a limited Nationwide Series schedule for the team this season, will fill in for Hamlin.
Gibbs also said that Hamlin was going to the hospital for further treatment and doctors told Hamlin not to race.
Hornish finished 17th in Sunday's race.
