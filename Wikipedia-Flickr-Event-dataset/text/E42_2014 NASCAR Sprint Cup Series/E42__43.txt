FORT WORTH — Breaking down the AAA Texas 500 from Texas Motor Speedway:

Winner: Jimmie Johnson won for a record fourth time at Texas Motor Speedway, fending off Brad Keselowski on a second green-white-checkered finish. Kevin Harvick finished second, followed by Keselowski, who was grabbed by Jeff Gordon after the race. That touched off a brawl between their teams in the pits.

Gordon had seized the lead from Hendrick Motorsports teammate Johnson on a restart with nine laps remaining and seemed headed toward his second victory at Texas. But a caution for debris set up a green-white-checkered finish, and Gordon lost the lead to Johnson after choosing the outside lane for the restart. His No. 24 Chevrolet then collided with Keselowski, and Gordon spun with a flat tire, falling a lap down and finishing 29th.

"Out of nowhere I just got slammed by the 2. And I cut my left rear tire," Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. "He's just a dips---t. The way he races, I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of it. We had the car. We had the position.

"I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head."

There were 13 caution flags, setting a record for the 28 Sprint Cup races at Texas Motor Speedway.

"Today was just a testament to this team that we never give up that we just keep fighting," Johnson said. "This was a Chase that was tough for us but to come here and redeem ourselves and get a win means so much. ... Just a fantastic day."

Chase outlook: Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s win at Martinsville and Johnson's win here (by a non-Chase driver) means that three of the final four spots in the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway will be determined by points. Results of the eight Chase drivers:

Kevin Harvick second

Brad Keselowski third

Carl Edwards ninth

Denny Hamlin 10th

Joey Logano 12th

Ryan Newman 15th

Matt Kenseth 25th

Jeff Gordon 29th

Tire troubles: Joey Logano's fortunes took a decided turn for the worse in the last 40 laps. A disastrous pit stop because of poorly attached lug nuts dropped the No. 22 Ford from fourth to 22nd on a restart, and Logano then spun with an apparent flat tire when the race went green. After winning in each of the past two rounds, Logano's Chase hopes took a serious hit.

On the brink: Carl Edwards started 11th but wasn't a factor in finishing 20th or worse for the third consecutive race. Edwards, who has only two starts remaining in his career at Roush Fenway Racing, will need a victory at Phoenix to stave off elimination and advance to the championship round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup, but his No. 99 Ford hasn't won since June.

Blistering pace: The first half of the race was run with only one caution flag (debris on Laps 43-46). The long green-flag sequence left only 14 cars on the lead lap as some blinding speed was applied on the 1.5-mile oval by pole-sitter Matt Kenseth, who led the first 53 laps, and Jimmie Johnson, who led the next 114.

New crews: Danica Patrick and Kurt Busch switched crews for the final three races of the season, and the swap's debut brought mixed results. Under the guidance of crew chief Tony Gibson, Busch started fourth – his best qualifying effort in nearly three months – and ran in the top 10 for much of the race. Patrick didn't fare as well with crew chief Daniel Knost, struggling in practice and starting from the rear after a transmission change. She made an unscheduled pit stop early and was off the lead lap for most of the race. The No. 10 Chevrolet slapped the wall with 84 laps remaining, ensuring her fourth finish outside the top 25 in six races.

Next: The finale of the three-race segment dubbed the "Eliminator Round" will take place Nov. 9 at Phoenix International Raceway. The race will determine the four drivers eligible for the championship in the Nov. 16 season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway.
