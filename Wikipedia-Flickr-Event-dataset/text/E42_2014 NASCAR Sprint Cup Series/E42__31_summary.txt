zMAX Dragway gave drag racing fans one heck of an Easter present Sunday afternoon.
Proprietor Greg Walter, the trackâ€™s executive vice president, had some incredible news when he took to social media.
Revealed: the track, which pioneered four-wide racing, is taking things up two notches further.
For the record, Walter did not give a timeline for when the Dragway will be expanded to six lanes.
