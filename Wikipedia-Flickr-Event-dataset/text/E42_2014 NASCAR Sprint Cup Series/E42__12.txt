HARRISBURG, N.C. (November 25, 2013) -- Today, JTG Daugherty Racing team officials announced a technical alliance with Richard Childress Racing that will include receiving ECR Engines and engineering services during the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season with driver AJ Allmendinger behind the wheel of the No. 47 entry.

“We certainly appreciate all the support that TRD (Toyota Racing Development) has provided to JTG Daugherty Racing for five years and we are great fans of their business model,” JTG Daugherty Racing co-owner Tad Geschickter said.

“As a single-car team, we feel that aligning directly with a successful multi-car organization like Richard Childress Racing is what will work best for us in 2014.”

After nearly 15 years of success in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, JTG Daugherty Racing ventured into the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series with driver Marcos Ambrose at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in July of 2008. Ambrose went on to score the team’s career-best finish with second-place at Watkins Glen International on August 10, 2009.

2000 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Bobby Labonte took the reins in 2011 and delivered his best finish with the team at Daytona International Speedway on February, 20, 2011 when he crossed the finish line in fourth-place. This season AJ Allmendinger has earned the team’s best finish of the season (10th-place) at Watkins Glen International in August and will be behind the wheel of the No. 47 full-time starting in 2014.

“With our RCR alliance and AJ behind the wheel, we are looking forward to a fresh start in 2014,” Geschickter said.
