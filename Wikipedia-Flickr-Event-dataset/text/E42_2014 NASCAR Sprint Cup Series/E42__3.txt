Martin Truex Jr. has agreed to drive the No. 78 Furniture Row Chevrolet in 2014.

Sources say the parties came to terms on Wednesday night. A formal announcement is expected next Tuesday.

In his eighth year as a full-time Sprint Cup driver, Truex has spent the past four seasons driving the No. 56 NAPA Toyota for Michael Waltrip Racing.

However, MWR’s manipulation of the outcome of the Sept. 7 race at Richmond International Raceway and subsequent sanctions from NASCAR resulted in Truex’s disqualification from the Chase for the Sprint Cup and NAPA’s decision to part ways with the organization at the end of the season.

MWR announced Monday that the company would move on with only two full-time teams for 2014.

Truex, 33, has two career Sprint Cup wins — the most recent coming June 23 at Sonoma Raceway. He has competed in the Chase twice and is 16th in this season’s points standings. Truex won consecutive Nationwide Series titles in 2004-2005.

Truex will replace Kurt Busch, who joins Stewart-Haas Racing in 2014. Busch joined Furniture Row Racing with six races remaining in 2012. He led the Denver-based team to its first Chase berth in the company’s nine-year history.

The Barney Visser-owned operation is the only single-car team – and only team outside of North Carolina – to qualify for NASCAR’s playoffs. Busch shattered all previous team records for top fives, top 10s and laps led. FRR is currently seventh in the standings.
