As part of their technical alliance, Germain Racing and team owner Bob Germain will lease Earnhardt/Childress Racing engines and share in RCR's aerodynamic and wind tunnel data programs.
Casey Mears, a former RCR driver, has been at Germain since he ran a limited Cup schedule for the team in 2010.
Bootie Barker became the team's crew chief when Mears moved to Germain Racing in the fall of 2010.
RCR also has a technical alliance with Furniture Row Racing, which has improved dramatically this year with new driver Kurt Busch.
