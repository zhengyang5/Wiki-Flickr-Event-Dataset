Jimmie Johnson affixes the third "2014 Winner" sticker in four weeks to his car.
"We had figured out every way to lose this race," Johnson said after winning at Michigan for the first time in 25 tries.
"We had one restart where we fell back to about seventh, so we had to exploit the pit strategy rather than just rely on a fast race car," he added.

To listen to Knaus, you'd think that Johnson just scored his first Cup race win, not his 69th.
