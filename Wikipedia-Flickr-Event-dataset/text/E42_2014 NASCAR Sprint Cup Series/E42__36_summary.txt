As was the case this year, the 36-race calendar will begin at Daytona and finish at Homestead, with the 10-event Chase retaining the same events in the same order.
The only modifications are a date swap between Kansas and Darlington in the spring, and the move of the Texas race from Saturday evening to Sunday afternoon.
In addition to confirming the schedule, NASCAR also announced that its Air Titan track drying system will be available at every race during 2014.
NASCAR's senior vice-president of racing operations Steve O'Donnell said this would allow the series to minimise the time lost to rain delays.
