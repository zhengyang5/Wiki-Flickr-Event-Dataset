MARTINSVILLE, Va. -- Breaking down the Goody's Headache Relief Shot 500 from Martinsville Speedway:

Winner: Dale Earnhardt Jr. scored his first victory at Martinsville Speedway, taking the lead from Tony Stewart after restarting fifth with less than five laps remaining.

"We have tried to win here so many years and this place is so special to me. Real emotional win. I can't believe we won here," Earnhardt Jr. said from victory lane.

This weekend marked the 10-year anniversary of the Oct. 24, 2004 crash of a plane on its way to Martinsville that claimed 10 lives, including team owner Rick Hendrick's brother, son, nieces, his team's head engine builder and general manager.

"I'm just really emotional. This means so much to all of us," Earnhardt Jr. said. "I lost my daddy a long time ago. And I know how hard that is. I can't imagine losing the magnitude of people that Rick did. My heart goes out to him.

"This honors them," Earnhardt Jr. said.

Chase outlook: Earnhardt's win (by a non-Chase driver) means that at least two of the final four spots in the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway will be determined by points. Results of the eight Chase drivers: Jeff Gordon second; Ryan Newman third; Joey Logano fifth; Matt Kenseth sixth; Denny Hamlin eighth; Carl Edwards 20th; Brad Keselowski 31st; Kevin Harvick 33rd.

"I thought we had the car to beat," Gordon said. "Those last couple of laps were just wild. This means so much to Hendrick Motorsports. It's the best way to pay tribute to everyone we lost 10 years ago.

"I would have loved to get that win to move on to Homestead. But I'm real happy for Dale. I know this means so much to him."

Wipeout: Harvick's worst finish in seven years at Martinsville put the Stewart-Haas Racing driver in a win-or-else situation for the next two races. After starting 33rd, Harvick patiently worked his way into the top 10 before disaster struck on lap 229. His No. 4 Chevrolet was collected in a crash with Kenseth, whose Toyota lost traction under braking entering the first turn. Harvick, who has led a career-high 1,817 laps this season, lost 42 laps to repairs.

Keselowski also is facing a grim situation for advancing to Homestead after his car suffered a mechanical problem with 65 laps remaining and fell outside the top 30. After a dramatic win at Talladega Superspeedway last week to remain Chase eligible, Keselowski likely will need another victory in the next two weeks to race for the title.

Too much speed: Chase contenders Gordon and Newman both were penalized for being too fast during pit stops under yellow on Lap 190. Gordon restarted 30th and Newman was 31st, but they made swift comebacks as both climbed into the top 15 within 40 laps. Keselowski also rebounded from an early speeding penalty.

Five feud: The caution flag flew three times for a row that ignited between Kasey Kahne and Brian Vickers. It started with Kahne spinning Vickers on lap 161. Vickers, whose No. 55 Toyota fell four laps down, returned the favor in turn 1 on lap 222 with a punt that sent Kahne's No. 5 Chevrolet to the garage. After returning more than 30 laps down for repairs, Kahne plowed into Vickers again on Lap 278, which resulted in a warning to both drivers from NASCAR. Cautions at Martinsville aren't uncommon for Vickers, who was involved in five yellows during a race on the paper clip-shaped oval three years ago.

When it rains: Six-time series champion Jimmie Johnson's nightmarish Chase continued at one of his best tracks. He ran in the top five for much of the first 100 laps before losing two laps after a green-flag pit stop because of a vibration. Mired outside the top 30, Johnson ran into good friend Casey Mears on a restart, and the damage eventually sent his No. 48 Chevrolet to the garage. Johnson, who has four straight finishes outside the top 15 and is winless since June, placed outside the top 35 at Martinsville for the first time in 26 starts at a track where he has eight victories.

Bittersweet farewell: Kurt Busch's bid for a second consecutive win at Martinsville exploded in flame and smoke when an oil line ruptured while his No. 41 Chevrolet was running seventh. Busch saluted crew chief Daniel Knost, who will switch with crew chief Tony Gibson and move to Danica Patrick's team next week.

Next: The middle event of the three-race segment dubbed the "Eliminator Round" will take place Nov. 2 at Texas Motor Speedway. The circuit then heads to Phoenix International Raceway, where the Nov. 9 race will determine the four drivers eligible for the championship in the Nov. 16 season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway.
