UPDATE: Paul and Aleia Wolfe welcomed their first child, Caden Paul Wolfe, early Sunday morning.
Wolfe will rejoin Keselowski this week for next Sunday’s Sprint Cup race in Las Vegas.
Keselowski tweeted Saturday morning, “Gonna miss having my crew chief Paul Wolfe this Sunday.
Nine of Keselowski’s 10 career Sprint Cup victories have been with Wolfe as his crew chief.
Wilson will likely make calls for adjustments on the car, while Erwin, who was Sam Hornish Jr.’s crew chief last season and formerly was Greg Biffle’s crew chief in the Sprint Cup Series, will make calls on strategy.
