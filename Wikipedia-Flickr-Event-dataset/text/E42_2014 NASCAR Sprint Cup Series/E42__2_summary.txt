Earnhardt Ganassi Racing has tabbed Kyle Larson to drive its No.
Those concerns, however, are not shared by Ganassi, who called Larson a "unique talent" and the "future of this sport."
"I think Kyle is the kind of driver, when he sees an opportunity in front of him, he takes it," Ganassi said at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
I don't think there's any pressure like that.
I'd like to prove the people who don't think I'm ready for it wrong.
