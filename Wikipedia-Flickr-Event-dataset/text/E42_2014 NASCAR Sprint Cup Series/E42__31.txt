Alright! zMAX Dragway gave drag racing fans one heck of an Easter present Sunday afternoon.

Proprietor Greg Walter, the track’s executive vice president, had some incredible news when he took to social media.

Revealed: the track, which pioneered four-wide racing, is taking things up two notches further. In an even greater first for the sport, the track that sits across the street from Charlotte Motor Speedway, is expanding its racing surface to become the first track in the world to ever host a six-wide race.

Ironically, the announcement comes just a few days before zMAX Dragway’s sister track — The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway — hosts its first four-wide event this coming weekend.

Logistically, it’ll be a tight fit, but zMAX Dragway officials believe they can squeeze in two more lanes at one of the more popular tracks on the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series schedule.

For the record, Walter did not give a timeline for when the Dragway will be expanded to six lanes. But that’s not all.

Other ideas that Dragway officials are throwing around include putting a chicane in the track (!!!!????), maybe even expanding to 16-wide!

Of course, that will take a lot of money to do.

Location of the grandstands will likely have to be pushed back a considerable distance if the track indeed expands to 16-wide.

So, without further adieu, check out what drivers like John Force, Antron Brown and especially Ron Capps have to say about the new idea. (Oh yeah, you might want to re-read this story and look at the first letter of every paragraph to reveal an even bigger surprise!)
