CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- Morgan Shepherd will attempt to become the oldest driver to race in the Daytona 500 when he tries to qualify later this month.

Shepherd turned 72 in October. He became the oldest driver to compete in a Sprint Cup race last summer at New Hampshire.

He'll try to qualify for the Daytona 500 in the No. 93 Support Military Foundation Toyota in collaboration with BK Racing.

Shepherd partnered with SMF when he ran New Hampshire last July. It was Shepherd's first Cup race since 2006. He ran 92 laps before retiring. Shepherd ran eight Nationwide Series races last season, and ran the full 34-race schedule in 2011.

Shepherd has competed in 15 previous Daytona 500s, with a career-best finish of second in 1992 while driving for The Wood Brothers.
