Denny Hamlin has signed a contract extension with Joe Gibbs Racing.
11 Toyota, made the announcement on Twitter on Saturday night from Kentucky Speedway prior to the Quaker State 400 Sprint Cup race.
He also has two victories this year with new crew chief Darian Grubb, who led Tony Stewart to the 2011 Cup title.
FedEx as a policy does not announce signings, but it's believed the company typically keeps its contracts with JGR aligned with Hamlin.
JGR consistently fields title contenders and, with all four seats locked up at Hendrick Motorsports, Hamlin doesn't see the upside of moving to another team.
