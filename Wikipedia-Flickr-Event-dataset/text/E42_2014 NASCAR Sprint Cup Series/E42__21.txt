CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Penske Racing has signed Brad Keselowski and Miller Lite to contract extensions through the 2017 season.

It's the second contract extension for the 2012 Sprint Cup Series champion in less than two years. Keselowski signed an extension after the 2011 season that ran through next year. That contract was redone to put the driver and sponsor in concurrent deals.

Miller Lite is extending a partnership with Roger Penske that spans more than three decades. The beer brand has been the primary sponsor in NASCAR of Penske's flagship No. 2 car since 1991.

"This puts us in great shape because we've got continuity with a sponsor and an elite driver,'' Penske told The Associated Press.

The new contract covers just 24 races instead of the full 36-race schedule Miller Lite had always sponsored. Penske and MillerCoors chief marketing officer Andy England say the 12-race giveback was at Penske's request.

Keselowski said discussions on the extension began after last year's championship as he and Penske charted a plan on how to stay on top in NASCAR. Keselowski cited the continuity surrounding Jimmie Johnson, who won five consecutive championships with the same crew chief and sponsor.

"I feel like, together, Roger and I have done some great things. I have a lot of confidence in him, I like the way he treats me and hopefully he would say the same about me,'' Keselowski told AP.

"It makes me feel very comfortable to go the extra mile to sign a long-term deal. At this point in time, with all these deals lined up, the health, the future of Penske Racing and its employees is now secured, at minimum, for the next half-decade.''
