CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Penske Racing has signed Brad Keselowski and Miller Lite to contract extensions through the 2017 season.
It's the second contract extension for the 2012 Sprint Cup Series champion in less than two years.
Penske Racing has signed driver Brad Keselowski and his sponsor, Miller Lite, through 2017.
The new contract covers just 24 races instead of the full 36-race schedule Miller Lite had always sponsored.
At this point in time, with all these deals lined up, the health, the future of Penske Racing and its employees is now secured, at minimum, for the next half-decade.''
