LOUDON, N.H. -- Kevin Harvick is leaving Richard Childress Racing after this season for the same reason future boss Tony Stewart left Joe Gibbs Racing after the 2008 season.
He needed a change to rejuvenate his career.
"It wasn't anything personal from Richard's standpoint or the team's standpoint of doing anything wrong," Harvick said.
"It was me trying to rejuvenate myself and be excited to do winter testing and things that go with it.
He understands better than most Harvick wanting to rejuvenate his career.
