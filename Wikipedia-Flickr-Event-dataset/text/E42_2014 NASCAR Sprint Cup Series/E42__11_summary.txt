Addington was hired Thursday to lead Phoenix Racing, the Spartanburg, S.C.- based race team purchased by Harry Scott Jr. in September.
Now 49, he'll be commuting back and forth as the competition director for Phoenix Racing and crew chief of the No.
SHR had hired Rodney Childers from MWR in August to crew chief Kevin Harvick, and Johnston and Childers worked side-by-side at MWR.
Addington, a longtime Nationwide Series crew chief, has spent nine seasons at the Cup level.
He was paired with Kyle Busch at Joe Gibbs Racing, Kurt Busch at Penske, and Stewart the last two seasons.
