NASCAR has unveiled an almost unchanged schedule for its 2014 Sprint Cup season, with only a handful of minor tweaks to the dates that form the current calendar.

As was the case this year, the 36-race calendar will begin at Daytona and finish at Homestead, with the 10-event Chase retaining the same events in the same order.

The only modifications are a date swap between Kansas and Darlington in the spring, and the move of the Texas race from Saturday evening to Sunday afternoon.

In addition to confirming the schedule, NASCAR also announced that its Air Titan track drying system will be available at every race during 2014.

NASCAR's senior vice-president of racing operations Steve O'Donnell said this would allow the series to minimise the time lost to rain delays.

"Having the Air Titan at each NASCAR Sprint Cup Series weekend allows us to meet a very important goal set by our chairman and CEO, Brian France: to drastically decrease track-drying time to the best of our ability and ensure our fans in the stands and those watching on TV get to see each race on its scheduled day," O'Donnell said.
