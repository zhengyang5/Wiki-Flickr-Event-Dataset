Chevrolet will expand its already impressive NASCAR Sprint Cup lineup next year when Germain Racing defects from the Ford camp. The Ford-to-Chevy announcement came several days ago, but became more newsworthy on Friday, when Richard Childress Racing confirmed it will form a working relationship with Germain.

As part of their technical alliance, Germain Racing and team owner Bob Germain will lease Earnhardt/Childress Racing engines and share in RCR's aerodynamic and wind tunnel data programs. The relationship also includes technology sharing, engineering cooperation and R&D.

Casey Mears, a former RCR driver, has been at Germain since he ran a limited Cup schedule for the team in 2010. The No. 13 Ford Fusion has been sponsored since 2009 by Geico, which reportedly is committed through the 2015 season. Bootie Barker became the team's crew chief when Mears moved to Germain Racing in the fall of 2010.

In addition to Mears -- he's been the team's only full-schedule driver -- Germain has used Max Papis (33 races over two seasons), Mike Skinner (15), Landon Cassill (three) and Dave Blaney and Todd Bodine (one each). The family-owned team raced Toyotas in 2009 and Chevrolets in 2010 before going to Ford in 2011.

It won the 2006 and 2010 Camping World Truck Series titles with Bodine. All told, Germain Racing won nine Truck Series poles, 22 races (21 by Bodine, one by Ted Musgrave), had 102 top-five finishes and 149 top-10 finishes in 340 starts dating to its debut in 2004. It used 21 drivers through the years, with Bodine by far its most successful.

RCR also has a technical alliance with Furniture Row Racing, which has improved dramatically this year with new driver Kurt Busch. And rumors persist that RCR might work out a third technical alliance, this one with Toyota-based JTG/Daugherty Racing if that struggling organization also chooses to change manufacturers.
