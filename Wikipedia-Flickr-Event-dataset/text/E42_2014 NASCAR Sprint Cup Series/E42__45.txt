AVONDALE, Ariz. — Breaking down the Quicken Loans Race for Heroes 500 at Phoenix International Raceway:

Winner: Kevin Harvick dominated for his third consecutive victory at Phoenix International Raceway, easily outdistancing Jeff Gordon. Matt Kenseth, Brad Keselowski and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five.

"Wow. I guess that's what it feels like to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries.

Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title next Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway without the win.

"I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on."

Chase outlook: The winner next week at Homestead-Miami Speedway will be a first-timer. None of the four finalists have won a Sprint Cup championship.

The battle for the last spot in the championship round came down to the last corner when Ryan Newman bumped Kyle Larson up the track to capture 11th place.

"They didn't make any rules that said we couldn't use" the apron, said Newman, who claimed he owed Larson the maneuver based off a truck race at Eldora Speedway two years ago. "From my standpoint, I call it even," Newman said.

"I just gave it my all. They paved it that way for a reason. ... I did what I had to do. I'm not proud of it, but I think if (Larson) was in my position he would have done the same. That kid is a hell of driver and he's going to have tremendous success here."

Newman's move bumped Jeff Gordon out of the top four Chase drivers by one point.

"It's disappointing. We have a lot to hold our heads high about," the four-time champion said. "The way we raced this race and this season. I hope we taught people that you can race clean and you don't have to wreck people and ruin people's season. It just makes last week hurt that much more. Second just wasn't good enough. Harvick was just in another zip code. Nobody was going to be able to stop him today."

Gordon was referencing Brad Keselowski, another Chase driver that missed the final four. Keselowski's move in a green-white-checkered finish at Texas Motor Speedway last week resulted in Gordon suffering a flat tire and falling from a potential top-three finish to 29th place. Gordon lost 27 points that day.

Keselowski, who was trying to win his second title in three years, was philosophical after the race.

"We were just a little bit short. Kevin was just really strong all day long," he said. "We just weren't strong enough to win. We were strong enough to run second or third but not strong enough to win.

"It doesn't really feel good. At the end of the day we won six races (so far in 2014) and that's a lot to be proud of. That's the most races this year but it wasn't enough."

Race results of the eight Chase drivers:

Kevin Harvick first.

Jeff Gordon second;

Matt Kenseth third;

Brad Keselowski fourth;

Denny Hamlin fifth;

Joey Logano sixth;

Ryan Newman 11th;

Carl Edwards 15th.

Stop signs: The pressure for the Chase contenders seemed most magnified in the pits, where the mistakes happened early and often. Hamlin led the first 24 laps from the pole position, but things went sideways when he was forced to make a second stop during the first yellow on Lap 32 when a crew member accidentally flattened his new right-rear tire with an air gun.

"What a crazy day," Hamlin said. "You just think about everything that went wrong and you think it's not your day, but you just keep fighting, keep fighting."

Gordon's team was forced into a scramble on Lap 85 when problems changing the right-rear tire necessitated skipping the left sides.

Logano found trouble during a caution on Lap 124 because of a violation for equipment outside the pit box.

"Those situations (going a lap down) happen you have to try to stay calm which is hard to do when there's so much on the line," Logano said. "This team deserves to be in the final. We proved throughout this whole Chase and through the whole year."

Heavy traffic: Dropping deep in the field was an unenviable scenario for Chase contenders. After his team's pit miscue, Hamlin restarted 35th and struggled to gain positions. He fell a lap down during a 47-lap green-flag sequence.

Logano encountered the same fate during a 58-lap run of green after dropping from second to outside the top 25.

Gordon was able to rebound, but he was helped by a caution flag 10 laps after his team's pit error that allowed a left-side tire change.

Next: The championship finale of the 2014 season will take place Nov. 16 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Of the four eligible drivers, the first to cross the finish line (regardless of overall position in the 43-car field) will win the title.
