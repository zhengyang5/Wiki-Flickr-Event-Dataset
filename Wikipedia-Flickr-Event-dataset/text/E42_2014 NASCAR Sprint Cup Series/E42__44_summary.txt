AVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) â€” This season has played out as a battle between Team Penske and Hendrick Motorsports.
He'll race Denny Hamlin, Joey Logano and Ryan Newman next Sunday for the championship, and the highest finishing driver will claim the title.
The final pairing does not include any of the Hendrick drivers, and only one of the two Team Penske cars.
And Penske has only Logano racing for the title after Brad Keselowski, a six-time winner this season, was eliminated on Sunday.
But much like Hamlin, Logano had to work for it Sunday after a penalty for leaving pit road with his gas can still attached to the car.
