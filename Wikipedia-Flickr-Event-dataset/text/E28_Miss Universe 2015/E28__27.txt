History of Great Britain at Miss Universe

There was no UK participant at Miss Universe in 1953-1954. From 1955-1990 (except 1956), the winner of Miss England competed. Miss Scotland and Miss Wales first competed in 1961 and again, competed every year until 1990, except 1987 in Scotland’s case, as that year’s Miss Scotland, Eileen Catterson, was disqualified for being under age.

In Miss Universe 1991, Helen Upton, the winner of the 1990 Miss United Kingdom pageant, became the first contestant since 1952, to compete at Miss Universe under the Miss GB or Miss UK banner. She competed as Miss United Kingdom.

In 1992 Miss Great Britain Universe came back until 2000. There was no British representative at Miss Universe from 2001 to 2004. Their highest placement was in 2012 with Amy Willerton when she made the TOP 10.
