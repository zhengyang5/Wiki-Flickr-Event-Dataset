Donald Trump slammed his longtime partner NBC on Monday after the broadcaster announced it was cutting ties with him.
Trump stands by his statements on illegal immigration, which are accurate,” read a statement from his office provided to EW.
Mr. Trump says, ‘We must have strong borders and not let illegal immigrants enter the United States.
“Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.
To that end, the annual Miss USA and Miss Universe Pageants, which are part of a joint venture between NBC and Trump, will no longer air on NBC.
