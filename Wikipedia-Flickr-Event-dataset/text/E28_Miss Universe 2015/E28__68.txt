Miss Austria Miss Universe Miss Universe 2015 Annika Grill Preliminary Austria Europe

The gorgeous Miss World Austria 2012, Amina Dagi, has been chosen as the official representative of Austria at the Miss Universe 2015 pageant. 20 years old Amina represented Austria in the 2012 Miss World pageant. The official announcement was made by the organisation. Usually the winner of Miss Austria represents the country at both Miss World and Miss Universe pageant. And previously Annika Grill was supposed to compete at both the international pageants. But, coincidently, the finale dates of both Miss World and Miss Universe are overlapping one another, which is why the changes had to be amended by Austria. Therefore, Annika will be representing the country at the Miss World 2015 pageant to be held in Sanya, China. And hence, Amina was chosen for the Miss Universe 2015. First Annika, and now Amina, it seems like Austria is resolute on sending exceptionally talented contestants to the two major international pageants. Amina has a good amount of experience as to how it is to compete at an international level. What is your opinion on the two gorgeous ladies fromAustria? Do you think they have what it takes to be the next Miss World and Miss Universe?
