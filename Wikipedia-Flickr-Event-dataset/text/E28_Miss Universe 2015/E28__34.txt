In 2002, Andrea Roche Model Agency was awarded the rights to host the Miss Universe Ireland pageant and to send an Irish representative to compete at Miss Universe. This came in 2003 after the Miss Ireland Organisation changed owners and dropped the license of Miss Universe. Since then the organisation has been sending the Republic of Ireland’s representative to the international beauty pageant. Cooper is a strong delegate and was favourite to win the crown. She has a cute face and an adorably irresistible personality, which might help her in the Miss Universe pageant. However, the competition this year is tough and the contenders are very strong. It would be difficult for the judges to select one clear winner. Therefore, the contestants have to prove their worth to make their way to the crown. Do you think Cooper has what it takes to be the next Miss Universe?
