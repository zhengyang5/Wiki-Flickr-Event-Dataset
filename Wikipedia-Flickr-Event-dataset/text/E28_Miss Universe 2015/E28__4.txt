NBC has released a statement indicating that it is ending its relationship with Donald Trump, and will no longer carry the Trump-produced Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants. In addition, Trump will also not be returning to the reality series The Apprentice. Here’s the full statement:

“At NBC, respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values. Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump. To that end, the annual Miss USA and Miss Universe Pageants, which are part of a joint venture between NBC and Trump, will no longer air on NBC . In addition, as Mr. Trump has already indicated, he will not be participating in “The Apprentice” on NBC. “Celebrity Apprentice” is licensed from Mark Burnett’s United Artists Media Group and that relationship will continue.”
