Uttarakhand girl Urvashi Rautela, selected to represent India in the upcoming Miss Universe pageant, said she would be using every opportunity that comes her way to bring the spotlight on the hill state at the global beauty pageant.

“Uttarakhand, the Land of Gods, is the perfect destination for those seeking natural splendor, adventure, spirituality, peace and fun, all at the same time. I would try my best to popularise my state at the Miss Universe platform,” Rautela, who visited Dehradun on Monday, told Hindustan Times.

The hill beauty, who has a string of prestigious modeling pageants to her name, was crowned as Miss Diva 2015 earlier this month, making her India’s official candidate at this year’s Miss Universe pageant to be held in the United States in December.

Upon reaching Dehradun, the Haridwar-born model visited the famous Tapkeshwar Temple in Dehradun’s Garhi Cantonment area “to seek Lord Shiva’s blessings” and later met chief minister Harish Rawat in the evening.

She will be heading to Kotdwar — a small town at the Garhwal Himalaya foothills where she grew up - where she will visit her school and meet underprivileged children.

Rautela credited her beauty to the pristine environs of her home state. “The Himalayan region, where I grew up, is so pure and divine, its air and water devoid of pollution which perhaps makes the pahadi girls so beautiful,” said Rautela, who had made her Bollywood debut opposite actor Sunny Deol in Singh Saab The Great (2013) and later shot to fame as rapper Honey Singh’s ‘Love Dose’ girl.

A film showcasing her journey from Kotdwar to becoming India’s Miss Universe candidate is also being shot during her Uttarakhand visit. “I am very proud of my Uttarakhand roots and want to work for the empowerment of girls in the state,” she said.

Rautela was chosen to represent India at Miss Universe earlier in 2012 as well, but was later dethroned as she was found ‘underage’ for the contest.
