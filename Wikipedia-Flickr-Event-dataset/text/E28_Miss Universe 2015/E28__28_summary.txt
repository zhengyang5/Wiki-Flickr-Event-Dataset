Mikaela Fotiadis was elected as Miss Universe Greece in a casting held on October 30, 2015.
She already represented Greece at Miss Young International, Miss Tourism and recently on the Next Top Model Contest.
Mikaela Fortidis will represent Greece at the Miss Universe contest which will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada.
This will be the first edition of Miss Universe under the new owners as Donald Trump sold the pageant to WME/IMG.
The last Greek to be in the semis of Miss Universe was Evagelia Aravani and that was ten years ago.
