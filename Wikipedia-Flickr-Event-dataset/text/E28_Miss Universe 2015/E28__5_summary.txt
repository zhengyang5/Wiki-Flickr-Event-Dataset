"At NBC, respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values," the company said in a statement.
"Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.
Undaunted, Trump fired back, saying in a statement that he stands by his comments: "NBC is weak, and like everybody else is trying to be politically correct.
Trump said he won't be "participating" in "Apprentice" during his run for the presidency.
