Uttarakhand girl Urvashi Rautela, selected to represent India in the upcoming Miss Universe pageant, said she would be using every opportunity that comes her way to bring the spotlight on the hill state at the global beauty pageant.
I would try my best to popularise my state at the Miss Universe platform,” Rautela, who visited Dehradun on Monday, told Hindustan Times.
The hill beauty, who has a string of prestigious modeling pageants to her name, was crowned as Miss Diva 2015 earlier this month, making her India’s official candidate at this year’s Miss Universe pageant to be held in the United States in December.
A film showcasing her journey from Kotdwar to becoming India’s Miss Universe candidate is also being shot during her Uttarakhand visit.
Rautela was chosen to represent India at Miss Universe earlier in 2012 as well, but was later dethroned as she was found ‘underage’ for the contest.
