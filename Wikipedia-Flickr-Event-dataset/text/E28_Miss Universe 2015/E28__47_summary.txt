The professional model, who hails from Cagayan de Oro, will represent the Philippines in the Miss Universe pageant.
For the question and answer portion, Wurtzbach was asked about her thoughts on Internet censorship by Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo.
But this year's Cinderella story belonged to Janicel Lubina, who was crowned Binibining Pilipinas International.
