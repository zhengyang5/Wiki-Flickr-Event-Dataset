Univision is canceling its telecast of the Miss USA pageant, an event partially owned by Donald Trump, to protest Trump's offensive remarks about Mexicans.
Trump also said he intends to sue Univision for refusing to carry the Miss USA pageant.
"We will not be airing the Miss USA pageant on July 12 or working on any other projects tied to the Trump Organization."
Shortly after Univision pulled the plug on Trump, the man who was scheduled to be the Hispanic host of the Miss USA pageant also quit.
The deal -- reportedly five years long -- called for Univision to broadcast and co-produce the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants.
