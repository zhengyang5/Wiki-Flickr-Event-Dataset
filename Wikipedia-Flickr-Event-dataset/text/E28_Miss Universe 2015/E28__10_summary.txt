There are 80 women competing in the Miss Universe 2015 beauty pageant this year vying for the crown.
Las Vegas will be sizzling with so many beauties in one single stage at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino.
Sin City is ready for these girls ready to take over the title from Paulina Vega who just won the crown in January.
After the controversial Donald Trump statements regarding Mexicans earlier this year, Mexico had pulled out of the event leaving Wendy Esparza out of the pageant.
The Republican presidential hopeful later sold his stake in the Miss Universe organization and Esparza will now be joining the rest of the girls in the worldwide event.
