And Perez Hilton at the 2015 Miss Universe Pageant epitomized the holiday season in the best way possible by wearing a Christmas-themed suit and tie combo.
That's right, in a competition known for its ridiculous costumes, it seems that Hilton may have topped them all.
I mean, Miss Salvador dressed up as her nation's national bird, with the most intricate head piece I've ever seen.
Clearly, there have been standout style moments at the 2015 event, but on the red carpet, Hilton may have taken the cake.
Remember when he showed up at LOGO's 2012 NewNowNext Awards wearing (once again) a matching suit, except that time, he had forgotten his under shirt?
