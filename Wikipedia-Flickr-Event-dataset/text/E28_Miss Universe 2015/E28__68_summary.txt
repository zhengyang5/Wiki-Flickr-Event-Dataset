Miss Austria Miss Universe Miss Universe 2015 Annika Grill Preliminary Austria EuropeThe gorgeous Miss World Austria 2012, Amina Dagi, has been chosen as the official representative of Austria at the Miss Universe 2015 pageant.
Usually the winner of Miss Austria represents the country at both Miss World and Miss Universe pageant.
But, coincidently, the finale dates of both Miss World and Miss Universe are overlapping one another, which is why the changes had to be amended by Austria.
And hence, Amina was chosen for the Miss Universe 2015.
Do you think they have what it takes to be the next Miss World and Miss Universe?
