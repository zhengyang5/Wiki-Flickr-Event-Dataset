Miss Universe judge Perez Hilton tells Us Weekly what his fellow pageant judges were thinking after Steve Harvey "f–ked up big time," when the host mistakenly announced Miss Colombia as the winner over Miss Philippines during the live broadcast on Sunday, December 20.
Because I knew how I voted and I knew that all the other judges voted for Miss Philippines to win.
"When Steve Harvey came out, I thought, 'OMG, they totally did this on purpose,'" Hilton recalls to Us.
Yes, it sucks for Miss Colombia, but now the pageant and Miss Philippines and everybody wins.
"At first, honestly, I didn’t think it was his fault," Hilton tells Us.
