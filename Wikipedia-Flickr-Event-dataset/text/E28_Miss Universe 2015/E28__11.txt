Bosnian-born Monika Radulovic was crowned winner of Miss Universe Australia 2015 in a fairytale ending after escaping her war torn homeland to come to Australia as a refugee when she was four.

The stunning psychology graduate, 24, beat 34 other hopefuls to take the glittering gown at the ceremony that took place in Melbourne on Friday.

Celebrities from around the country gathered in the ballroom at the Sofitel On Collins to watch the beauty queen compete for the second time before taking the title at the fifth annual Miss Universe Australia gala.

The natural beauty from New South Wales said she was overwhelmed with the title, as she will now represent Australia at Donald Trump's Miss Universe international final later this year.

'I don't know what I'm thinking, I just know that I'm so excited,' she told Daily Telegraph.

The runner up was 22-year-old Madeleine Cowe from Queensland, followed by 19-year-old Chanel Stewart from New South Wales in third place, while the Victorian entrants failed to make the top 10.

As the final five contestant were announced, the trademark round of questions were asked to the girls on issues including social media, feminism, governmental response to violence, extremism and bullying.

The crowd was taken away by Radulovic's answer to the question on violence and extremism.

'I hope in 50 years time we won't be asking this question at Miss Universe Australia,' she answered.

A panel of judges including Real Housewives of Melbourne favourite Gina Liano, high profile Australian Neurosurgeon and founder of the Cure Brain Cancer Foundation, Dr Charles Teo, TV producer Bonnie Lythgo, and Sofitel Melbourne On Collins General Manager Clive Scott, marked the contestant in three categories â€“ swimwear, eveningwear and questions and answers.
