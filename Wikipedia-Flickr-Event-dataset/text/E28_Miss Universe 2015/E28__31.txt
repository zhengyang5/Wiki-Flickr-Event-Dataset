Lisa Drouillard has been chosen as the Miss Universe Haiti 2015, at the pageant held at Port-Au-Prince on November 8’ 2015. She will now compete at the Miss Universe 2015 pageant. Lisa defeated eight beauties to clinch the title of Miss Universe Haiti 2015. Lisa is the thirteenth Miss Haiti since 1960. She is not a newbie in the world of pageantry, and has had her share of experience at the pageants.

She won Miss New York Teen USA 2011 and competed in Miss Teen USA 2011 as Miss New York. Then she won the title of Miss Grand Haiti 2014. She placed in the Top 10 of Miss Grand International 2014 pageant in Bangkok, Thailand last year. Standing tall at an astounding height of 5’8”, Lisa holds the chance to be the first Miss Universe from Haiti.

Haiti has managed only two placements at the Miss Universe so far. The first placement was achieved by Evelyn Miot in Miss Universe 1962 where she was one of the Top 15 finalists. The next and last placement of Haiti was achieved by Gerthie David, who finished as the first runner-up to Miss Finland Anne Pohtamo in Miss Universe 1975 that was held in El Salvador. Haiti could not crack the Top 15 slot at the Miss Universe 2014 pageant.

Lisa will have to face a tough battle at the Miss Universe 2015 pageant, given the long list of strong contenders competing this year. Miss Universe Indonesia Anindya Kusuma Putri, Miss India Urvashi Rautela, Miss Universe Thailand Aniporn Chalermburanawong, Miss Universe Peru Laura Spoya, Miss Universe Australia Monika Radulovic, Miss Universe Jamaica Sharlene Radlein, Miss Universe Great Britain Nena France, Miss Universe South Africa Liesl Laurie, Miss USA Olivia Jordan and Miss Universe Canada Paola Nunez Valdez are some of them.
