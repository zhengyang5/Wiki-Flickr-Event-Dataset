Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith served as a judge for the Miss Universe 2015 competition Sunday night. Former football player and a competition that results in a big winner — that makes this sports, right? Sure!

Poor Steve. Smith did tweet out his support to Harvey after the epic gaffe.

If you still don't believe this is sports-related, Michael Jordan was also involved.
