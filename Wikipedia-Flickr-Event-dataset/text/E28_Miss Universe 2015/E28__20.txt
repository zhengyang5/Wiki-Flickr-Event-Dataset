Miss Universe Miss Universe Croatia Miss Universe 2015 Miss Universe Croatia 2015 Barbara Ljiljak Mirta Laura Kustan Croatia Europe

Barbara Ljiljak, Miss Universe Croatia unfortunately broke her arm in accident yesterday! Consequently she will not be able to represent her nation at the coming edition of Miss Universe 2015, slated to be held in Las Vegas, this December 20. The news was officially revealed by Ivana, Miss Universe Croatia Organisation, Public Relations. As the beauty queen is unable to complete her duty as Miss Universe Croatia, she will be replaced by her runner up, Mirta Kustan, who will be wearing the sash of Croatia in the scintillating eve of Miss Universe. We wish Barbara a speedy recovery along with wishing Mirta all the best for her Miss Universe venture! 22 years old Mirta Kustan, hails from Krapinske Toplice and has studied at the Faculty of Law in Zagreb. Mirta aspires to either start a career in acting or become a leader. With such big aspirations resting in her mind, we are sure of her brilliant performance as she takes over the responsibility of making Croatia proud. Replacements have not been new thing in the pageant world. Last year Ukraine’s queen was replaced by her runner up, Diana Harashuka, who eventually went on to grab the second runner up spot at the Miss Universe 2014 coronation night. Do you think Mirta will accomplish a similar feat in the coming pageant? As they say, “Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end”, do you believe this could make or mar Croatia’s chance at the pageant?
