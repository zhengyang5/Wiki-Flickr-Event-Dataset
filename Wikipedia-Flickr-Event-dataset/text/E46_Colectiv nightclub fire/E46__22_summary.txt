The band, Goodbye to Gravity, was celebrating a new album with a free concert.
But suddenly the 300 or 400 people were scrambling toward the one exit at Colectiv, a club built inside a Communist-era factory.
Witnesses say pyrotechnics sparked a fire that quickly became a widespread blaze with dark, blinding smoke.
Authorities say the cause is something that needs to be figured out.
At least 27 people died and 162 were injured when the blaze broke out late Friday, authorities said.
