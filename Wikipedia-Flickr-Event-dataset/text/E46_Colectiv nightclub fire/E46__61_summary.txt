Romanian president to name new PM to form government after Victor Ponta resigns following protests by 20,000 peopleThe embattled Romanian prime minister has announced the resignation of his government following large protests over a nightclub fire that killed more than 30 people.
I’m resigning – and implicitly my government too,” Victor Ponta said, adding that he would stay on until a new government was in place.
Ponta, the country’s only sitting prime minister to stand trial for corruption, had been under pressure to resign from Iohannis, who defeated him in last November’s presidential election.
Prosecutors say that after Ponta became prime minister in May 2012, he appointed Sova as minister three times.
Ponta resigned as chairman of the ruling Social Democratic party in July saying he wanted to prove his innocence.
