According to one witness speaking to Romanian media, a fireworks display around the stage set nearby objects alight.
“There was a stampede of people running out of the club,” a man who escaped without shoes told Reuters.
The victims were admitted to 10 hospitals in Bucharest, said Raed Arafat, the head of emergency response at the interior ministry.
The victims are being transported to emergency hospitals.
Romania’s interior minister, Gabriel Oprea, went to the nightclub, along with emergency services.
