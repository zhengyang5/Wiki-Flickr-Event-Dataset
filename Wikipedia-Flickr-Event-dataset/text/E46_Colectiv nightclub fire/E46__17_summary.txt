Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta has announced his resignation after mass protests in the wake of a nightclub fire that killed more than 30 people last week.
"I'm handing in my mandate, I'm resigning, and implicitly my government too," Ponta said in a statement on Wednesday.
Ponta said he would stay on until a new government is in place.
President Klaus Iohannis will name a prime minister to form a new government, which needs to be approved by parliament.
Anger has been brewing for some time in Romania against the government, which many perceive as being corrupt, and Friday's fire has added to the discontent.
