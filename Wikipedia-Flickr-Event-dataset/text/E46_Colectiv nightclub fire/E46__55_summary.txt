My name is Pavel Popescu and i am one of the volunteers that is managing the helping process for the victims of the fireworks accident inside the Colectiv club in Bucharest.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectiv_nightclub_fireOur Minister of Health refused any help after the accident claiming that Romania has all the necesary infrastructure to handle it.
In this moment, there are many patients which are getting treatment in Romania where the conditions inside the hospitals are very bad.
We need professional dressings for burns, we need specials compression garments (costumes) for patients, lotions and many other medical accessories for more than 100 victims.
In the future, all this victims will be in need of plastic surgery and professional psychological support.
