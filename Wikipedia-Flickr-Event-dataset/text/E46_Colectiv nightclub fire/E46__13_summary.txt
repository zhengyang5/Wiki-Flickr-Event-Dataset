A blast in a Bucharest club has left 27 dead and at least 180 injured, according to Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea.
Bucharest hospitals are running out of space to treat the wounded, according to local media, and health officials are asking locals to donate blood to meet the demand.
The explosion was confirmed early Saturday by Romania's Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea and Health Secretary Raed Arafat, though its cause is not yet known.
More than 60 ambulances and fire trucks were on the scene, according to a press release from the Interior Ministry.
"I want to give you the official data, there is a crisis, everyone was mobilized and try to do everything we can," Health Minister Nicolae Banicioiu told reporters.
