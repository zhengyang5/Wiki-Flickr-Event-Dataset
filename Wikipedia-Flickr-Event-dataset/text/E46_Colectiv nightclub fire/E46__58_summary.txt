Thousands of Romanians gathered at an unannounced protest in the center of Bucharest on Tuesday to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Victor Ponta after 32 people died in a nightclub fire last week.
Demonstrators also requested the ouster of Deputy Premier and Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea as well as the dismissal of Bucharest district mayor Cristian Popescu Piedone.
While the channel didn’t say where it got the attendance estimate, it reported that similar protests were also held in other main Romanian cities.
