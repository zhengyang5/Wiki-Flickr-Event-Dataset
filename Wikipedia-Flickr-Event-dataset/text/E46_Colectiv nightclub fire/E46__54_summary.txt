Following the horrific nightclub blaze that killed 56 people in Bucharest last month, the Romanian government commissioned a sweep of 1,000 bars, venues, clubs, cinemas, and malls.
The General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations released a statement in Romanian this week saying they found over 3,200 violations, leading to the permanent closure and suspension of some businesses.
Many of these businesses lacked correct fire permits or firefighting equipment and neglected to hold fire drills, the Inspectorate said.
The organization also noted widespread violations of bans on illegal flames, pyrotechnics, and public smokingâ€”and doled out fines totaling 8.6 million lei, or 2.07 million dollars.
Protesters believe it is indicative of a wider corruption problem within the government that leads to a lack of accountability with regards to these issues.
