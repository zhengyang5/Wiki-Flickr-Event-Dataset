On behalf of the European Commission I would like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the victims of last night's tragic accident in a nightclub in Bucharest.

I am greatly saddened to see so many young lives ending so tragically.



My thoughts are with the grieving families and friends as well as with all those working hard in rescuing and in assisting the victims.
