President Klaus Iohannis said there were indications that safety regulations had been ignored at the club, and called for a swift investigation.
"I am saddened, but also revolted that a tragedy of this scale could have taken place in Bucharest," Iohannis said.
"It is unimaginable that there could have been so many people in such a (small) space and that the tragedy happened so quickly because simple rules were ignored," he added after visiting the scene.
"People could not get out of the club because there was only one exit open and the stampede happened immediately," he told online news portal Hotnews.
Several media outlets reported that a second exit was closed at the time when the blaze broke out.
