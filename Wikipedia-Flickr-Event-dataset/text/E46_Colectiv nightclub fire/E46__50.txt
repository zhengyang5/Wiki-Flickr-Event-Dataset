An Associated Press photographer at the scene saw people wandering around outside the club clad in emergency blankets in an apparent state of confusion.

Upon hearing the news, people descended on the club looking for loved ones. Adding to their anxiety was the fact that many of the clubgoers were not carrying identity papers so victims could not immediately be identified.

"She's not answering the telephone and she's not saying anything," said a mother, dressed in a black leather jacket, crying in front of television cameras.

"We want information whether he's alive," said a visibly overcome woman, speaking about a family member.

Media reported that emergency services arrived 11 minutes after the first call at 10:32 p.m.

Victor Ionescu, who was at the club with his girlfriend, told Antena 3 TV that "people were fainting, they were fainting from the smoke. It was total chaos, people were trampling on each other."

A young man filmed by Antena 3 said that flames engulfed clubgoers, burning their skin and hair.

Several major nightclub fires have been blamed on pyrotechnics igniting foam used for soundproofing, including The Station nightclub fire in the U.S. that killed 100 people in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 and the Kiss nightclub fire in Brazil, which killed 242 people in the university town of Santa Maria in 2013.

Raed Arafat, a government emergency situation official, said that people were treated for burns, smoke inhalation and lesions at hospitals around the capital. Twenty-five were reported in serious condition at the Municipal Hospital.

"It is a tragedy without precedent and it is an intervention without precedent," he said.

Manager of the Ophthalmological Hospital, Monica Pop, said the hospital had treated teens aged 14 to 16 for injuries.
