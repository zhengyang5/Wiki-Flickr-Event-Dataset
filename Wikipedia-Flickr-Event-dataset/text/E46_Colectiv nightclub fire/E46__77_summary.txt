The shivering scenes occurred during a live act by Goodbye To Gravity, a local metalcore outfit who were celebrating the release of their second full-length record, entitled Mantras of War.
17 metal bands from around the world have collaborated to record a tribute album in memory of GTG.
We’ve had the chance to talk to Auria Sapir, guitarist of Israeli metal outfit Matricide, who participated in the touching tribute.
We got some great exposure from Universal Music Romania and earned new audience, which is great.
