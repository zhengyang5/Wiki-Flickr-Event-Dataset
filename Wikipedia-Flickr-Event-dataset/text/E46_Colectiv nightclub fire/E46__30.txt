The number of people killed in Romanian club fire reached 30, as three more died on Sunday. Hospital sources said dozens others were in critical condition.

The Romanian government on Saturday declared three days of national mourning following the tragic deaths of people killed in a freak fire, started by pyrotechnics set off during a pre-Halloween, heavy metal gig. Twenty six died on Friday in the nightclub fire and four others in hospital, on Saturday and Sunday.

Of the nearly 200 injured, 146 people were hospitalised for burns, smoke inhalation and other injuries.

The blaze started on a pillar in the Colectiv club and quickly spread to the ceiling, which was covered in antiphonal material.

As hundreds of partygoers rushed to the only working exit door at the venue, pieces of the burning ceiling fell on the crowd.

A second door was later opened, but many people had already suffered burns or were in respiratory distress.

Police have started an investigation into the fire and authorities have set up telephone helplines for members of the public trying to locate friends and relatives.

Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Saturday asked for a thorough check of all nightclubs across the country to determine if safety requirements are being fulfilled.

In a response to an appeal for blood donations by the health minister, hundred of people lined up Sunday outside blood banks in Bucharest and some other centers across the country wishing to make donations to help those injured in the accident.
