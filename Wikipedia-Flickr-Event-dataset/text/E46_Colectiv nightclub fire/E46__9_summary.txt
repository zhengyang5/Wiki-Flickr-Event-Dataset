BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — An explosion and ensuing flames on a stage at a Bucharest nightclub on Friday left 27 people dead and 180 hospitalized with injuries, Romania’s interior minister said.
Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea said the explosion occurred at Colectiv club in downtown Bucharest, a city of 3 million people.
Witnesses told Antena 3 TV that there were between 300 to 400 people at the club when the metal band Goodbye to Gravity was performing and a “pyrotechnical show” went awry.
Digi 24 television station cited witnesses who said the explosion came after a spark on stage ignited some polystyrene decor.
Victor Ionescu, who was at the club with his girlfriend, told Antena 3 TV by telephone that there were huge flames after the explosion.
