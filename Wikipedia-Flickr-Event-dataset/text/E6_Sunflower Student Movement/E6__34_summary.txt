At a news conference yesterday morning, Executive Yuan spokesman Tung Chen-yuan (童振源) said Premier Lin Chuan (林全) has ordered the withdrawal of all charges of criminal offenses that are indictable only upon complaint against 126 students who occupied the Executive Yuan in March 2014.
That is why he decided to retract the charges,” Tung said.
Tung said that the decision by former premier Jiang Yi-huah’s (江宜樺) Cabinet to charge the students with illegally entering a building and damage to property was motivated by political considerations.
About 130 students who stormed the Executive Yuan were indicted, some of them on state-prosecutable offenses and others on offenses indictable only upon complaint.
“Premier Lin has affirmed the Sunflower movement’s contribution to Taiwan’s democracy with positive comments about demands, such as the need to pass legislation supervising cross-straits agreements before reviewing the trade in services agreement.
