Thousands of students protested in and around the legislature in Taipei against ruling party tactics designed to push a trade deal with China through Taiwan’s legislature.
Lawmakers from Taiwan’s political parties had agreed in June to review each provision of a trade deal signed with China.
Taiwan’s opposition Democratic Progressive Party said in a statement the ruling party had reneged on the agreement for a detailed review and wouldn’t accept the result.
Students, including Lin, believe the Kuomintang should retract any attempts to force the trade deal into law.
The legislature’s Vice President, ruling party lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu, said by phone the trade agreement hasn’t yet been scheduled for a full floor vote.
