Taipei, June 25 (CNA) The head of the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) under China's State Council arrived in Taiwan Wednesday for a four-day visit, the first such visit by China's top official in charge of ties with Taiwan.
Zhang Zhijun landed before noon at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, which was under tight security as some pro-Taiwan independence groups had vowed to protest his arrival and visit.
Zhang greeted officials waiting at the airport, including Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Deputy Minister Chang Hsien-yao.
Representatives from the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) jostled with police while displaying billboards reading: "Zhang Zhijun get lost."
Plans are for him to meet with Chinese spouses in Taiwan and with representatives of indigenous peoples, university students, farmers and fishermen, the MAC said.
