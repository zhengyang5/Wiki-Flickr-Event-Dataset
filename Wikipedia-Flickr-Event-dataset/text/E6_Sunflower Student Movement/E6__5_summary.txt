Taipei, March 23 (CNA) Student-led demonstrators who have been occupying the Legislature for five days in protest against a services trade agreement with China listed their demands in detail Sunday and said they planned to continue their protest action.
In response to President Ma Ying-jeou's call earlier in the day for the protesters to end their occupation of the Legislature, Lin Fei-fan, one of initiators of the occupation movement, laid out their demands at a news conference in the main chamber of the Legislature.
Meanwhile, the demonstrators vowed to continue their protests, ignoring Ma's call for them to end their occupation of the Legislature.
At an international news conference earlier in the day, Ma called on the protesters to vacate the Legislature and allow the resumption of its normal functions.
He also said he hopes the legislative review of the services trade agreement with China can be completed soon, reiterating that it is crucial to Taiwan's economic development and trade liberalization efforts.
