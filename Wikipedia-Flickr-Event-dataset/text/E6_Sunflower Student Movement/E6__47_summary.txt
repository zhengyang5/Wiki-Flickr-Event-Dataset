Zhang Zhijun, the head of mainland China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) will arrive in Taiwan tomorrow for a four-day visit.
It will be the first visit to Taiwan by the PRC’s top official for cross-strait relations.
Since then, the PRC has been trying to determine how to modify its approach to cross-strait relations to maximize public support in Taiwan.
Such meetings also represent Beijing’s attempt to broaden support for cross-strait relations by expanding PRC contacts beyond the traditional connections with KMT officials and business people.
Meanwhile, the opposition DPP continues to insist that Wang Yu-chi not make any formal agreements or discuss any sensitive issues during Zhang’s visit.
