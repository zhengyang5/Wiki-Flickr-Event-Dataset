Specifically, the new group, called Taiwan March, will advocate lowering the voter turnout threshold for a national referendum, which is currently 50 percent.
To this end, it will launch a petition seeking at least 100,000 signatures within six months, for an amendment to the Referendum Act, Lin said at a press conference.
The discussions will also include legislative review of a trade-in-services pact with China, he said, referring to the issue that spurred the student-led protests in Taiwan in March.
Lin and Chen led the Sunflower Movement, a series of protests organized by a coalition of students and civic groups from March 18 to April 10 against the cross-strait service trade pact.
