During the investigations, all 39 people admitted to participating in the intrusion into the Cabinet complex, but said their actions were only in support of the demonstration, which became known as the Sunflower Movement.
Tuesday's indictment brought the number of protesters charged to 132, for intrusion into Cabinet complex, including Wei Yang, one of the protest leaders.
The Sunflower Movement began after ruling Kuomintang lawmaker Chang Ching-chung fast-tracked the cross-strait trade agreement through a committee review March 17.
