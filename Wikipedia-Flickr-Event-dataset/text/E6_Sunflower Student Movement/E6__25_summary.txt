Chen and Lin led hundreds of students in the occupation of the legislative chamber on March 18.
Chinese people do not want you.”The students responded with applause and laughter, with many shouting: “We are not Chinese anyway.
We are Taiwanese.”Thousands of students supporting the Sunflower movement gathered outside the Legislative Yuan — mostly along Qingdao E Road — to protect those inside.
Responding from the legislative chamber, Chen said that Chang and his group should be appealing to the Presidential Office, not the anti-pact students.
The question is not to ask us when are we leaving the Legislative Yuan, but when these people will begin to solve the problem.”
