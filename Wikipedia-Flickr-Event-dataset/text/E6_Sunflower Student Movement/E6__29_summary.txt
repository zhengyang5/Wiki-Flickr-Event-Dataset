Taipei, April 21 (CNA) Key figures in the recent student-led protests over the trade-in-services pact with China were questioned by prosecutors Monday over their parts in the movement.
Wellington Koo, one of the lawyers for the group, said that, if charged, they will enter a plea of not guilty for the defendants.
Koo said his clients have told prosecutors that they will cooperate with the investigation and will not evade their legal liability.
The seven key members who are among the 21 people have refused to be interrogated by the police and reported instead to the Prosecutors Office.
