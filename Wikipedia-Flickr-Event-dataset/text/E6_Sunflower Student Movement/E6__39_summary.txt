Taipei, March 13 (CNA) The Taiwan High Court on Tuesday upheld the acquittal of the student leaders of the Sunflower Movement, saying that their protests in 2014 were a form of expression protected under freedom of speech laws.
The students' 24-day occupation of the Legislature in March 2014 was a protest against a lack of transparency in a trade-in-services agreement between Taiwan and China, the high court said.
The Sunflower Movement was form of expression protected under the laws of freedom of speech, the high court said.
Under the Criminal Speedy Trial Act, the case cannot be appealed in the Supreme Court, unless some violation of the Constitution is involved, since both the district court and the high court have acquitted the defendants.
In April 2017, a district court acquitted the other six people, and prosecutors later appealed the case in the high court.
