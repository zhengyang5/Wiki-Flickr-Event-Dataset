Prior to Jiang’s arrival, Lin told the crowd that the preconditions for dialogue with the premier would be his agreeing to withdraw the service pact — which the Executive Yuan has forwarded to lawmakers for review — from the Legislative Yuan and to draft legislation on monitoring future cross-strait talks and agreements.
“Withdraw the service trade agreement, pass the monitoring legislation,” demonstrators chanted as Jiang walked through the crowd escorted by police officers to reach the side gate of the Legislative Yuan building, where Lin and Lai were waiting.
“I’m saddened to hear these rumors, because they are baseless,” Jiang said.
“The last thing I want to say is that the two issues you [the protesters] are concerned about not only involve the Executive Yuan, but also President Ma Ying-jeou,” Jiang said.
Later yesterday, Jiang called a press conference at the Executive Yuan and read out a statement addressed to the students.
