Speaking during a meeting with New York University law professor Jerome Cohen in Taipei, Ma called the measures "very important" to the people and crucial to Taiwan's economic development and relations with China.
The comments came amid reports that the delay in ratifying the trade pact, signed by representatives from Taipei and Beijing in June 2013, has led China to suspend negotiations on all other proposed agreements, including an anticipated trade-in-goods pact and dispute settlement arrangement.
Deputy Economics Minister Duh Tyzz-jiun confirmed that the two sides have not had any talks on the goods agreement for two months.
Beijing has taken a reserved attitude in light of the controversy triggered by the services pact in Taiwan, he said.
