Taipei, April 10 (CNA) Tens of thousands of high-spirited protesters began dispersing as a festive rally outside the Legislature complex Thursday night marked an end to the student-led protest over the trade-in-services pact with China.
As the rally was ongoing, more than 100 protesters began exiting the building where they had been sitting in since March 18 just after 6 p.m.
The protesters demanded that the services pact be shelved until closer monitoring could be implemented through legislation.
Since their movement began three weeks earlier, they had expressed worries that the pact will give China too much economic influence over Taiwan and hurt local small and medium-sized enterprises.
The government, on the other hand, has maintained that the services pact will benefit Taiwan's economy and help its efforts to join other regional free trade blocs.
