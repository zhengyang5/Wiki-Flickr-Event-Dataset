The online petition, which started on 4:50pm on Monday and ended at 3:50pm on Tuesday, gained more than 700 signatures from the department’s alumni and students, she said.
“We showed self-control that night, by sticking to our principles.
Later yesterday, Jiang issued a press release through the Executive Yuan saying he was disappointed the protesters burned the book.
