More than 150 people were injured and 61 students arrested after riot police armed with batons and water cannon waded in to break up a protest over a trade pact with China at Taiwan's parliament in the early hours of Monday.
We are just plain students," said a soaking wet and weeping Huang Pei-feng, a sophomore of National Taiwan University, who was among those who faced the water canon.
Watch: Taiwan riot police dislodge protesters to retake government HQChina’s government has not commented on the protests, although an editorial Monday in the Global Times was harshly critical.
President Ma Ying-jeou denounced the “illegal” occupation of parliament by students opposed to the trade agreement’s ratification.
Ma cancelled all public activities scheduled for Monday and will meet senior officials to assess the impact of the protest.
