Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou agreed to meet protesters in a bid to assuage anger over a China trade pact that prompted a weeklong seizure of the legislature and clashes with riot police.
Ma is willing to meet the students to discuss the services trade pact, his office said in an e-mailed statement, after the president said earlier he would not hold face-to-face talks.
Some protesters say that the pact will squeeze out Taiwanese companies and make the economy more vulnerable.
You say this is a good deal, but good for whom?‚ÄùStudent protesters have demanded the services pact be renegotiated and are calling for a law governing future economic negotiations with China.
The U.S. hopes discussions on the trade pact can be carried out peacefully, State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said yesterday.
