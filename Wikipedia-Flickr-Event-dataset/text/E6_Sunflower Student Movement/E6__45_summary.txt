By William Lowther / Staff reporter in WASHINGTONLeaders of Taiwan’s Sunflower movement, who are on a two-week tour of North America, have been urging the US government to drop its “one China” policy.
Movement leaders are stressing that they are independent from, and are not backed by, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
Academia Sinica associate research professor Huang Kuo-chang (黃國昌) said there had been an awakening of civil society within Taiwan and that a third political force was emerging.
He said the delegation had repeatedly emphasized its concerns about the US’ “one China” policy.
“The Sunflower movement has nothing to do with the DPP,” Huang said.
