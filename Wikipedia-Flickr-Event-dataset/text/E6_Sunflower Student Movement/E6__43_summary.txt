Beijing has held off on further co-operation talks with Taiwan in a sign of growing displeasure over the island's delayed ratification of a services trade agreement signed last June.
The merchandise trade agreement and services trade pact are follow-ups to the Economic Framework Cooperation Agreement - a semi-free trade pact - signed by the two sides in 2010.
"The Democratic Progressive Party is expected to do all it can to block the services trade pact and make sure the new law is as strict as possible," said Hsu Yung-ming, an associate professor of political science at Soochow University.
He urged the legislature to quickly approve the services trade pact and the new law to increase scrutiny of future agreements to avoid delaying follow-up talks on the merchandise trade deal.
The legislature will hold an extraordinary session from Friday to review the services trade pact and the draft bill to increase scrutiny of future cross-strait.
