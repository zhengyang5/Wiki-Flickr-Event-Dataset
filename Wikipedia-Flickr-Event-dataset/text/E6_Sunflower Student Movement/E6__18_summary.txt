With no sign of a resolution in sight, a group of protesters slipped past security at the Executive Yuan, the seat of the Cabinet, at 7:35 p.m. on March 23.
Several black-clad riot police swung their batons at young protesters, while police used their PVC shields to hit sitting protesters on the legs.
At 2 a.m., police ordered media to leave the Executive Yuan, whereupon riot squads stormed the building and evicted the several dozen protesters who were still inside.
Based on accounts by activists and the state of those who were taken out of the building, riot police used excessive force to expel them.
By then, about 600 riot police and several hundred more law-enforcement officers were deployed at the Executive Yuan, while a few thousands protesters remained.
