The Taiwanese security forces must protect and respect human rights in any response to the hundreds of protestors that have occupied the nation’s parliament, said Amnesty International.

Approximately 200 students occupied the parliament in Taipei on Tuesday evening to protest against a proposed trade deal with China.

“The situation is clearly tense and security forces must show restraint. While police have a duty to maintain order and to protect the safety of the public, the response must only be proportionate to the threat.

“Force should only be used as a last resort. The authorities must ensure the rights of all those protesting are upheld and respected,” said Roseann Rife, East Asia Research Director.
