But, he added, the students wanted to discuss whether Taiwan needed new legislation to monitor all cross-strait agreements, and whether the service trade pact with China should be delayed until that legislation is introduced.
Taiwan signed the service trade pact with China, its biggest trade partner in June last year, but it is yet to be ratified.
The agreement will open up 80 of China's service sectors to Taiwan and 64 of Taiwan's service sectors to China, including tourism, transport, construction and telecommunications.
A review of the deal was delayed in Taiwan's legislature until March 17, when Taiwan's ruling party Kuomintang pushed the pact forward without bipartisan deliberation.
Hours before the scuffle, Taiwan's president defended the deal in his first public address to the protests.
