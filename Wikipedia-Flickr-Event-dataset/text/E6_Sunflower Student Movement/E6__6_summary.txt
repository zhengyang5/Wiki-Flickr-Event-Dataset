Hundreds of protesters stormed the Executive Yuan in Taipei on Sunday evening , shortly after Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou dismissed protesters' demands to scrap a service trade agreement with China.
They are demonstrating against a trade agreement with China.
Taiwan and China signed the trade pact in June last year, but a review of the deal has been delayed in the legislature.
The Kuomintang has since agreed to review the pact one clause at a time during a second reading of the deal.
His government did not respond to a March 21 ultimatum by protesters to issue an apology for the deal.
