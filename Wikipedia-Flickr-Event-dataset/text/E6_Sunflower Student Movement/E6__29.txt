Taipei, April 21 (CNA) Key figures in the recent student-led protests over the trade-in-services pact with China were questioned by prosecutors Monday over their parts in the movement.



Accompanied by lawyers, Lin Fei-fan, Chen Wei-ting, law scholar Huang Kuo-chang and four other key members of the Sunflower Movement attended the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office voluntarily that day to explain what happened during their 21-day occupation of the Legislature that began March 18 and the attempted occupation of the Executive Yuan March 23.



They left the office after one hour of questioning.



Wellington Koo, one of the lawyers for the group, said that, if charged, they will enter a plea of not guilty for the defendants.



Koo said his clients have told prosecutors that they will cooperate with the investigation and will not evade their legal liability.



The prosecutors said that several of the members stand accused of a number of offenses, such as obstructing a police officer in the discharge of his duty, and will be investigated.



The Taipei City Police Department recently issued notices to 21 participants in the protest, but only one of them showed up for questioning that day.



The seven key members who are among the 21 people have refused to be interrogated by the police and reported instead to the Prosecutors Office.
