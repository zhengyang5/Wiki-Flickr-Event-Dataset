Lin Ming-hui (林明慧), a teacher from Taichung, filed the suit alleging excessive use of force in violation of the Act Governing the Use of Police Weapons (警械使用條例).
Lin sought compensation from the Executive Yuan, Taipei City Government, National Police Agency and Taipei City Police Department.
Lin said he took part in a sit-in protest at the Executive Yuan on March 24 last year.
Following Friday’s ruling, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) said that his government would not appeal the decision.
“I hope Mayor Ko can help to find the officer responsible, because we must not let taxpayers foot the bill for police violence.”
