A total of 22 protesters were indicted by Taipei prosecutors in February 2015 for breaking into the legislative compound on March 18, 2014, which led to a 24-day, unprecedented occupation of the parliament by hundreds of protesters.
In a first ruling, all defendants were found not guilty though prosecutors could still appeal.
Following the Sunflower movement, two similar incidents occurred in the same year and many protesters were indicted in February 2015 for their roles in those protests.
Premier Lin Chuan (林全) dropped the charges filed against 126 suspects by the previous government shortly after he assumed office in May 2016.
A ruling on charges brought against the rest is expected on April 10.
