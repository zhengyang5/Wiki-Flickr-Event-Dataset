TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Protests and clashes welcomed China’s Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun as he arrived for his first ever visit to Taiwan Wednesday.
Zhang arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport just before noon, with a meeting with his Taiwanese counterpart, Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi, scheduled for the early afternoon.
They showed ‘red cards’ as in soccer to show Zhang he was not welcome and should leave immediately.
During the afternoon, staff reportedly offered them a choice between either leaving together but not through the hotel’s front door, or staying inside their room.
“Welcome China special envoy Zhang Zhijun to visit the nation of Taiwan,” one banner held up by Taiwan Independence groups read, while others emphasized the Taiwanese people’s rights to self-determination.
