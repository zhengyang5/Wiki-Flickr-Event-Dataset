Students occupying the Taiwanese legislature to oppose a services trade pact with the mainland vowed yesterday to mobilise thousands of protesters to demonstrate in front of the office of the island's president, Ma Ying-jeou, on Sunday.
About 200 students seized the legislature on March 18 after the government went back on an agreement to review the trade pact line by line in parliament.
"There will be no end to the protest" until Ma compromises, Lin told reporters.
The protests over the trade pact escalated late on Sunday when police in riot gear used water cannons to remove students who had forced their way into government offices close to the legislature.
Meanwhile, the mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office yesterday held its annual conference on cross-strait economic ties in Jiangxi .
