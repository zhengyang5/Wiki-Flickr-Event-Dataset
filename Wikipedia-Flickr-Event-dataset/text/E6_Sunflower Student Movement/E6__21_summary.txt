Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou said he’s willing to meet protesters in a bid to assuage anger over a China trade pact that’s prompted a weeklong seizure of the legislature and violent clashes with riot police.
Ma’s offer to meet had pointed to a way out of a crisis that’s tested the president as he battles low popularity.
Student protesters have demanded the services pact be renegotiated and are calling for a bill to ensure oversight of future deals with China.
They also called on Ma to meet with them to answer their demands.
The services trade agreement, signed by cross-strait negotiators in June, would open service industries such as banking, hospitals and beauty salons to markets and competition across the Taiwan Strait.
