Taipei, May 23 (CNA) Premier Lin Chuan (林全) has decided to withdraw criminal charges filed by the previous Cabinet in 2014 against 126 protesters who broke into its headquarters in Taipei in March that year during the student-led Sunflower Movement against a controversial Taiwan-China trade pact.
Tung further said that the premier thinks the Cabinet's move to press criminal charges against the student protesters back then was a political reaction.
The Sunflower Movement began after Kuomintang lawmaker Chang Ching-chung (張慶忠) fast-tracked the trade-in-service agreement with China through a committee review on March 17, 2014.
The break-in occurred at a time when several hundred protesters had already occupied the Legislative Yuan for several days.
