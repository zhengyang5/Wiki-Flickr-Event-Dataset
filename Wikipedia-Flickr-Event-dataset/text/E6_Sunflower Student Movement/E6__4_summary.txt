After the KMT imposed internal measures making dissent grounds for expulsion, its reluctant legislators fell in line and began the process of passing the pact in the legislature.
A June 25, 2013 agreement stipulated that the pact would be reviewed clause-by-clause.
However, KMT legislators blocked the process, leading to clashes in the legislature over a period of three days.
With 65 members in the 113-seat legislature, the KMT was assured a victory, with expectations that the pact could be implemented as early as June 2014.
Late in the evening, protesters — a mix of students, academics, civic organizations and others — climbed over the fence at the legislature and managed to enter the building.
