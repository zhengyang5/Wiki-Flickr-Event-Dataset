National Taipei University’s sociology department dean Tsai Ming-Chang (蔡明璋) announced a similar moratorium in a text message to his faculty and students on Saturday.
“In light of the ongoing student-led protests against the cross-strait treaty, the department has decided to suspend all classes for the following week and will reschedule the canceled classes,” Tsai said.
National Tsing Hua University president Ho Cheng-Hong (賀陳弘) said that Yao’s unilateral cancellation of classes could infringe on students’ right to education.
“No supervisor of the school’s teaching units is allowed to unilaterally announce a suspension of classes,” Ho said.
Lin Yu-shan (林裕山), secretary of National Taipei University’s president’s office, said the president respected the department’s decision and would ensure that it rescheduled the canceled classes.
