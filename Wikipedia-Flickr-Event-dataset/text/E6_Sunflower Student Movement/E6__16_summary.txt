Story highlights Student protesters' ultimatum to Taiwan's government passes without a responseThe protesters have occupied Taiwan's Legislature for four days to protest a trade pactThe pact is intended to ease investment and trade between Taiwan and ChinaHundreds of student protesters barricaded inside Taiwan's Legislature for the past four days say they are disappointed by the government's failure to respond to their ultimatum Friday.
As the deadline passed, no direct response from Ma was given, and student protesters appeared on Taiwanese television expressing their disappointment.
The trade pact was signed last year in Shanghai to ease investment and trade between the two longtime adversaries, mainland China and Taiwan.
"The trade agreement was not supervised by the people of Taiwan, and benefits only big companies and harnesses our jobs," Chang wrote.
On Wednesday, Ma called for the passage of the trade pact.
