Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Sunday, March 30 saw the opening of a new chapter in Taiwan's rich history of student rallies as the Sunflower Student Movement reached what is likely to be its peak.
Today, the boy who grew up in the southern city of Tainan has become a full-blown political activist and can be called the face of the Sunflower Student Movement.
Words like "peoples' hero" and "charismatic" have been attached to the young man, a graduate student at National Taiwan University, and he has been characterized as the more level-headed of the two outspoken student leaders of the movement also being called the 318 Student Movement.
Prior to the start of the Sunflower Student Movement that led to the ongoing occupation of the Legislative Yuan, Miaoli-born Chen had already made a name for himself by participating in a number of student and civic movements.
The DPP has openly expressed its support for the protest movement, but former DPP Chairwoman Tasi Ing-wen played down the student leaders' connection to her party.
