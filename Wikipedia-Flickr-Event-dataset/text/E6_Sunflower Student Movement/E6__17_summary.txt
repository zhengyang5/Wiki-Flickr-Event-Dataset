“These are items paid for by taxpayers’ money and we hope the Legislative Yuan can resume its normal proceedings soon and find a solution through democratic means,” the statement said.
Earlier yesterday, Wang ruled out calling in law enforcement officers to remove the students from the chamber.
“For now, I am only thinking of the students’ safety and am not considering having them removed by force,” Wang said in response to reporters’ questions.
Having students occupy the legislative chamber is not a question of legislative autonomy, but of social order, Wang said.
Wang has not been to his office in the legislative building since the students stormed and occupied the chamber on Tuesday.
