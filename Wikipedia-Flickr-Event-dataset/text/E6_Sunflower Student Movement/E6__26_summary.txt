Taipei, April 6 (CNA) A leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus said on Sunday that he felt that Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng has sold out the KMT by promising to enact a law to monitor pacts with China before resuming legislative review of Taipei's trade-in-services pact with Beijing.
Fai said Wang asked KMT legislative leaders to accompany him on his visit and, therefore, gave the public the wrong impression that the ruling party agreed with his statement.
He cited Deputy Speaker Hung Hsiu-chu, a KMT lawmaker who was also in Wang's company during the visit, as telling him afterwards that she had no knowledge in advance of Wang's promises, either.
Lin said he was taken aback by Wang's statement, adding that the speaker should have a moral obligation to inform the KMT caucus of his announcement beforehand.
However, DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming dismissed the KMT lawmakers' remarks as being a poor excuse to back down.
