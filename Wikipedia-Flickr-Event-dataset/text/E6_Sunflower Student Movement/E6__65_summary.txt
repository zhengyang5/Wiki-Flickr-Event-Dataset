The participants tend to be ordinary people who want their voices heard, and want to protect Taiwan's future.
"Over the nearly two-week protest, the students are no longer just asking for the government to cancel the agreement and do a thorough review.
But the ruling Kuomintang party controls a majority of the legislative seats and the president controls the ruling party.
If the students succeed, it could mean a further democratisation of Taiwan, with additional safeguards to let the people, not any political party, decide the fate of the island.
