Taipei, March 24 (CAN) As ruling and opposition lawmakers continue to discuss a means to end deadlock over the service trade agreement with China, Premier Jiang Yi-huah said that his party hopes any item-by-item review of the pact will be handled at a floor session of the Legislature.
During his discussions with President Ma Ying-jeou, who chairs the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Jiang has heard no talk of sending the pact back to the Legislature's committees -- a stage that KMT legislators managed to sidestep when the opposition tried to prevent them from holding the review meeting as planned.
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng convened a meeting between ruling and opposition lawmakers Monday afternoon that failed to make any substantial progress.
Ker Chien-ming, legislative whip of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, called the KMT's insistence on a floor session a trick and called the meeting futile.
