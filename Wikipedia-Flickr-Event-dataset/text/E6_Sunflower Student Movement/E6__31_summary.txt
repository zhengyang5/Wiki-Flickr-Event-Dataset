It is the first time a premier has been accused of attempted murder and summoned to face charges, although prosecutors have not charged Jiang.
The Executive Yuan yesterday said Jiang and his codefendants are to appear in court this afternoon to answer questions.
Lin Fei-fan (林飛帆) and Chen Wei-ting (陳為廷), two prominent Sunflower movement leaders, said they will be present outside the court to lend support to the plaintiffs.
Other leading Sunflower movement figures, student groups and rights organizations have said they will also mobilize members to go to the courthouse.
Lee Po-chang (李柏璋), a well-known Sunflower movement figure, posted “Death to Tyranny!” on Facebook yesterday after it was announced that Jiang would appear in court.
