US general says Iran helping stop Iraq bloodshedBAGHDAD (AFP) â€” A US general on Wednesday acknowledged Iran's role in helping quell the bloodshed in Iraq, saying Tehran had contributed to stopping the flow of arms across the border into the country.
"We are all thankfull for the commitment Iran has made to reduce the flow in weapons, explosives and training (of extremists) in Iraq," Dubik told reporters in Baghdad's Green Zone.
"As a result of that, it has made some contribution to the reduction of violence" in Iraq, he said.
US commanders claim violence in Iraq has dropped by 55 percent since the military's surge became fully operational in June.
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates earlier this month said Tehran had assured Baghdad it would help stop the inflow of Iranian weapons into Iraq.
