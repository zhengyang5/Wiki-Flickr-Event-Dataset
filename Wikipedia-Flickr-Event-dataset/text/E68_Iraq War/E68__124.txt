ISTANBUL — Turkey’s military said it bombed Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq before dawn on Sunday, as part of an American-sanctioned effort to weaken the Kurdish guerrilla group that hides there. An Iraqi official said one woman had been killed in the airstrikes.

Turkish fighter jets struck targets in the regions of Zap, Avashin and Hakurk, along the border with Iraq, and the military followed up with artillery strikes, the Turkish military said in a statement on its Web site.

The commander of the Turkish Army, Gen. Yasar Buyukanit, said that the United States had helped the operation by offering intelligence and clearance to enter Iraqi airspace.

The military gave no details about how many planes were involved or the extent of the attacks; Turkish NTV television reported that the mission involved more than 50 planes. The strikes, which began around 1 a.m. local time and lasted for about three hours, also hit Qandil, an area farther inside Iraq, where some of the commanders for the Kurdish militant group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, known as the P.K.K., the initials of its Kurdish name, are believed to hide.

It was the second set of strikes against the Kurdish militant group since Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey met with President Bush in Washington last month, and the largest known cross-border attack since the American invasion in 2003. The first strikes, on Dec. 1, were artillery attacks from Turkish territory.
