CBO estimated that interest costs alone from 2001-2017 could total more than $700 billion.
So far, Congress has given Bush $604 billion for the two wars, with about $412 billion spent in Iraq, according to CBO, which is Congress’ in-house budget analyst.
Finance charges for the money already spent on the war will total $415 billion from 2001 to 2017, according to CBO.
For the next decade, “interest outlays would increase by a total of $290 billion over that 10-year period,” CBO told the House Budget Committee, which is reviewing long-term war costs.
CBO estimated that of the $2.4 trillion long-term price tag for the war, about $1.9 trillion of that would be spent on Iraq.
