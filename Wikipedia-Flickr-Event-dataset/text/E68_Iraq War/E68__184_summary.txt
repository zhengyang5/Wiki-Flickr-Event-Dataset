The U.S. on Monday delivered the first lot of F-16 fighter jets to the Iraqi government to be used in the fight against Islamic militants.
"After years of preparation & training in the U.S., Iraqi pilots today landed the 1st squadron of Iraqi F16s in #Iraq," he said.
That's the internal conflict inside Iraq,” he said.
The fight inside Iraq right now is against ISIL.
And our expectation is that if and when they start flying missions and combat sorties in Iraq, that's what they'll they be used for: not to go after -- not to contribute to any sectarian issues inside Iraq,” Kirby added.
