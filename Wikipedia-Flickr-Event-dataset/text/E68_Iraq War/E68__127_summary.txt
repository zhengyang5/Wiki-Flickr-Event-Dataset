General Thomas Metz, who heads the Pentagon office created to counter roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan, said yesterday that the number of devices found in Iraq had dropped to between 12 and 20 a month, from 60 to 80 earlier this year.
By early this year, however, the US was again accusing Iran of supplying EFPs.
US military officials have said weapons have been found with stamps showing they were produced in Iran this year.
Besides EFPs, the military said it found Iranian mortars, rockets, small arms and other kinds of roadside bombs.
Iran has been making overtures to the US since Barack Obama won the presidential election last month.
