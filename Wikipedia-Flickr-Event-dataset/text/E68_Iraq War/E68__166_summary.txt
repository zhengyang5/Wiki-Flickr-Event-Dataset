Wednesday’s attacks, which killed at least 51 people, many of them police officers, were seemingly the insurgents’ reply.
Despite suggestions otherwise, the mostly Sunni insurgents proved their ability to undertake sophisticated attacks virtually anywhere in Iraq, capitalizing on the Shiite-led government’s dysfunction and perceptions of American vulnerability.
“This is the government?”For weeks, there had been a sense of inevitability to the assaults, and American military officials had warned that the insurgents would seek to show their prowess during the holy month of Ramadan.
It is remarkable the degree to which the Aug. 31 date has gone unnoticed among Iraqis; many believe the American military will never really leave, despite a deadline of 2011 for its departure.
American soldiers in Humvees and armored vehicles, with a token Iraqi escort, drove through parts of Baghdad on Wednesday.
