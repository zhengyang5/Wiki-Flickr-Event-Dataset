Sunni officials charge that militia leaders are involved, while Shiite officials believe that the attackers are renegade members of the groups.
American military officials say they suspect that Iran’s paramilitary force, Al Quds, is directing the Shiite militias’ attacks against the Awakening movement.
American and Iraqi officials agree that Al Qaeda is the major threat, followed by the Shiite militias.
But many Awakening members like Mr. Abbas turn that hierarchy of risk upside down, singling out the Shiite militias.
While the attacks are taking a toll on Awakening members, they are causing even more damage to the delicate relationships between former insurgents and the government.
