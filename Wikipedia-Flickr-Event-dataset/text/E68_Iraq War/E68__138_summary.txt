The parliamentary vote was broadcast on Iraqi television The Iraqi parliament has voted to accept a deal on the future presence of US troops in the country.
The decision, praised by US President George Bush, means US troops will leave Iraqi streets by mid-2009 and will quit Iraq entirely by the end of 2011.
Some groups fiercely opposed the pact in parliament and at mass rallies, demanding that US troops leave earlier.
'Equal partners' In a statement from Washington, the US president congratulated the Iraqi parliament, saying its vote had affirmed "the growth of Iraq's democracy and increasing ability to secure itself".
Speaking before the vote, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said its success would constitute a "victory for democracy because the opposition have done their part and the supporters have done their part".
