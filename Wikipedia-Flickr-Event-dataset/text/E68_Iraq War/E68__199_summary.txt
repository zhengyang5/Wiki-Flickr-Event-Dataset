Barack Obama has made good on one of his election promises, announcing: "After nearly nine years, America's war in Iraq will be over."
Jonathan Steele wrote that the Iraq war was over and the US had learned "that putting western boots on the ground in a foreign war, particularly in a Muslim country, is madness".
Yet this madness may continue in a different guise, as there is a huge gap between rhetoric and reality surrounding the US departure from Iraq.
Crucially, all these US staff, including military and security contractors, will have diplomatic immunity.
In 2008, much was made in of the fact that as part of the Status of Forces Agreement (Sofa) between the US and Iraq, contractors would lose their immunity.
