The Senate voted on a resolution to revoke congressional authorization of the Iraq war and an amendment to strip the indefinite detention powers from the defense authorization bill.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who was elected in last yearâ€™s Tea Party tidal wave, was a leader in both fights.
Tea Partier Mike Lee of Utah, who voted with Paul on the Patriot Act and the Libya war, was conspicuously a no vote.
On the matter of indefinite detention for terrorism suspects, the only Republican to join Paul was moderate Mark Kirk of Illinois.
The other Tea Party-backed conservatives voted with John McCain and Carl Levin to keep those powers in the defense bill.
