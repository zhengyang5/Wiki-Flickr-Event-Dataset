Al-Moussawi said Amnesty International was relying on reports from "biased sources," such as relatives of detainees.
Al-Moussawi said that there are "no secret prisons" in Iraq.
The United States military in Iraq said detainees in the Iraqi judicial system are not "likely to face torture and ill-treatment."
"There are no secret prisons in Iraq at all," the prime minister said in an April 26 interview with state-run Al-Iraqiya TV.
Al-Moussawi said Monday that al-Maliki had shut the government-run facility after the torture reports were made public and an investigation was carried out.
