BAGHDAD — A senior leader in one of the main Sunni Arab parties participating in the coming provincial elections survived an assassination attempt on Wednesday in Baghdad that left four people dead and 10 others wounded, according to his party and a security official.

The Sunni leader, Ziad al-Ani, dean of the Islamic University and assistant secretary general of the Iraqi Islamic Party, was leaving his campus in Baghdad’s northern Adhamiya district in a well-guarded six-car convoy when a sport utility vehicle loaded with explosives and parked on the street near the gate was detonated, said witnesses and an Interior Ministry official.

Mr. Ani escaped unscathed, but the attack killed four bystanders and wounded several of his bodyguards. Ahmed Hashim, the chief of security at the university, said that this was the third attempt on Mr. Ani’s life.

Omar Abdul Sattar, a member of Parliament from the Islamic Party, said that Mr. Ani was not running for office but was very involved in coordinating the party’s campaign for the provincial elections that will be held at the end of the month.
