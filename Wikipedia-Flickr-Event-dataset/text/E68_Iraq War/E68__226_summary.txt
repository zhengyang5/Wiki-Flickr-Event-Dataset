BENICIA - About 40 anti-war protesters held what they said would be their final rally Thursday, six years after the United States-led invasion began against Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
Patricia Kneisler, who has led the Benicia Peace Vigil for five of the last six years of the conflict, said the weekly demonstrations on First Street and Military began to subside after President Barack Obama's election in November.
The Benicia Peace Vigil was begun by a group led by Danika Carter Cavulich, a member of the Solano Peace and Justice Coalition, with its first protest coinciding with the day the first bombs fell on Iraq.
"We stand for peaceful resolution, not aggression," said Sandy Rappy, 68, of the Walnut Creek group Grandparents for Peace and Justice.
On the opposite corner of the demonstration is Veterans Memorial Hall, where a handful of counter-protesters waved American flags and criticized the peace activists and their decision to stop the vigil.
