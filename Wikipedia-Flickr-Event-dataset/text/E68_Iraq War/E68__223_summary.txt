Long an integral part of Baghdad's diverse ethnic and religious communities, Christians have lived side by side with their Muslim neighbors for generations, said Abdullah al-Naufali, head of Iraq's Christians Endowment.
But as Iraq's violence flared after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, churches and Christian homes were targeted, al-Naufali said.
Ten of Baghdad's 80 Christian churches have closed, and more than half of Baghdad's Christian population has fled, he said.
Bombs and targeted killings are not the only threats facing Iraqi Christians.
They will leave Iraq as soon as his wife, who is pregnant, gives birth, he said.
