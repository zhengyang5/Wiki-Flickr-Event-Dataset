WASHINGTON â€” Despite significant security gains in much of Iraq, nothing has changed within Iraq's political leadership to guarantee sustainable peace, a Pentagon report released Tuesday found.
The Pentagon report documents the steep decline in violence.
The report also said that despite four years of intense U.S. effort, the Iraqi security forces remain unprepared to operate independently.
The report also included polling data that indicate that Iraqis are skeptical about how widespread the drop in violence is.
But only 19 percent said that violence had declined elsewhere in Iraq.
