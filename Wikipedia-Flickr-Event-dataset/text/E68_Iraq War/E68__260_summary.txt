Kenyan papers urge the government to negotiate with the kidnappersThe capture of three Kenyan hostages in Iraq has bewildered newspapers back home, who demand to know why the insurgents have picked on a country that refused to join the US-led invasion.
"Spare Kenyans, we were not in the war," the East African Standard cries in a headline, and says Iraq is now "scary" even for those not directly involved in the conflict.
"Kenya has no troops in the Gulf, and Kenya did not take sides in the war that saw the US and its allies invade Iraq," the paper argues.
The People's Daily says that, like the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel in Mombasa, the kidnappings have unexpectedly put Kenya in the "the international spotlight".
DialoguePointing out that Kenya was one of the first to condemn the decision to invade Iraq, the paper urges the government not to be shy of negotiating with the kidnappers.
