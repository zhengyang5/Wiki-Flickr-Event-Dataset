Al-Qaeda in Iraq issued an Internet statement Wednesday saying it has killed two kidnapped Algerian diplomats.
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's office confirmed the killings this morning.
"The head of the Algerian mission Ali Belaroussi and the diplomat Azzedine Belkadi, whose government is ruling in violation of God's will, were killed," said the written statement.
In the video, Ali Belaroussi and Azzedine Belkadi gave their names and home addresses.
It was the first time they had been seen since being hauled away at gunpoint last week.
