Majority of Iraqi Lawmakers Now Reject OccupationOn Tuesday, without note in the U.S. media, more than half of the members of Iraq's parliament rejected the continuing occupation of their country.
They favor privatizing Iraq's oil and gas and decentralizing petroleum operations and revenue distribution.But public opinion is squarely with Iraq's nationalists.
Iraqi nationalists have attempted again and again to forge relationships with members of Congress, the State Department, the Pentagon and the White House but have found little interest in dialogue and no support.
The United States, in pushing for more aggressive moves against Iraqi nationalists and the passage of a final oil law, is playing a dangerous game.
Iraqi nationalists reached in Baghdad this week say they are beginning to lose hope of achieving anything through the political process because both the Iraqi government and the occupation authorities are systematically bypassing the Iraqi parliament where they're in the majority.
