For Immediate ReleaseOffice of the Press SecretaryFebruary 26, 2003President Discusses the Future of IraqWashington Hilton HotelWashington, D.C.7:22 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thanks for the warm welcome.
We hope that the Iraqi regime will meet the demands of the United Nations and disarm, fully and peacefully.
Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from many nations, including our own: we will remain in Iraq as long as necessary, and not a day more.
A new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the region.
We are a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
