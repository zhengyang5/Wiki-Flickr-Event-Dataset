This study analyzes the question of who won the Iraq War in broader terms, both in retrospect and looking forward.
[52] The Iraq War was not only the second longest war in U.S. history, (after the war in Vietnam); it is also the second most costly–surpassed only by World War II.
[55]There is no dispute that the Iraq War, like the Afghanistan War, added substantially to U.S. federal debt.
Analyzing the question of who won the Iraq War, in retrospect and looking ahead, the answer depends on our perspective.
