Iraq Part of Global War on Terrorism, Rumsfeld Says By Jim GaramoneAmerican Forces Press Service WASHINGTON, Sept. 19, 2002 -- Iraq is not separate from the global war on terrorism, it is part of it, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee today.
Rumsfeld said stopping rogue states from developing and using weapons of mass destruction is a key aspect of the global war on terrorism.
But he said the administration continues to believe that Iraq is a "grave and growing danger" to the United States and the world.
"Since Sept. 11 we have seen a new means of delivering these weapons -- terrorist networks," Rumsfeld said.
