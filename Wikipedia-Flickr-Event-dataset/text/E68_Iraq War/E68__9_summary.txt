Abu Mirna, the media coordinator for the Fadhil Awakening Council, said: “American forces have broken the alliance with us by arresting our leader.
Awakening Council members demanded Mr. Mashhadani’s release in exchange for the soldiers’ freedom, the officials said.
There have been arrests of some other Sons of Iraq members suspected of still working for insurgents, but not of anyone so prominent.
In Adhamiya, another important Sunni area in downtown Baghdad, the local Awakening leader, Abu Sejad, said news of the arrest was received with concern.
Mr. Rubaie accused the Iraqi security forces of ignoring Awakening Council members and treating them with disrespect.
