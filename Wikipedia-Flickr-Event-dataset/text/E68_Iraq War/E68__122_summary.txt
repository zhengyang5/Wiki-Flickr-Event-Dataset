IRBIL, Iraq (CNN) -- Turkish troops shelled farmland around a half-dozen villages in northern Iraq from across the tense border, an Iraqi Kurdish official said Sunday, in what the Turkish military called retaliation for weekend attacks by Kurdish rebels.
Turkish military trucks carry tanks on a road in southeastern Turkey on October 10.
A provincial intelligence official in Iraq's Kurdish city of Dohuk said the shelling set orchards and farmland ablaze, but no casualties were reported.
"The Turkish military responded to these unacceptable attacks and will continue to respond," a military statement said.
