President Regrets 'Bring 'Em On'NewsMax.com WiresFriday, Jan. 14, 2005Story Continues BelowOn July 2, 2003, two months after he had declared an end to major combat in Iraq, Bush promised U.S. forces would stay until the creation of a free government there.
To those who would attack U.S. forces in an attempt to deter that mission, Bush said, "My answer is, Bring 'em on."
"'Bring 'em on' is the classic example, when I was really trying to rally the troops and make it clear to them that I fully understood, you know, what a great job they were doing.
"I don't know if you'd call it a regret, but it certainly is a lesson that a president must be mindful of, that the words that you sometimes say.
I don't know if you'd call that a confession, a regret, something."
