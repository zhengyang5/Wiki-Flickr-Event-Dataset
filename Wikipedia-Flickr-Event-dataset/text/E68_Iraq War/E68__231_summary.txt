Special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction Stuart Bowen told the Times the missing money may represent "the largest theft of funds in national history."
It was not, it is crucial to note here, U.S. tax-payer dollars which have gone missing in Iraq.
The Los Angeles Times says some officials in Baghdad have threatened to take the U.S. government to court to reclaim the missing loot.
Bowen has been a harsh critic of the way the U.S. government spent money in Iraq following the ouster of Saddam.
In total, the Times says $12 billion in cash was flown into Iraq in 21 separate C-130 flights by May 2004.
