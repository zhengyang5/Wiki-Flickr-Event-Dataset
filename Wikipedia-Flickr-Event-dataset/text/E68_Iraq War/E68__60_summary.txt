Sources: White House to ask for up to $95 billionAdministration sources told CNN the White House is working on an emergency spending plan and may ask Congress for as much as $95 billion.
Pentagon sources put the likely request at closer to $60 billion, a figure also cited by some officials at the White House.
In September, White House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey estimated the cost of a war at more than $100 billion.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office released last fall was far more modest in its estimate of the cost of war with Iraq.
