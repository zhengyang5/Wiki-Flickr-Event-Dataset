WASHINGTON (CNN) -- All major indicators of violence in Iraq have dropped by between 40 and 80 percent since February 2007, when President Bush committed an additional 30,000 troops to the war there, the Pentagon reported Monday.
The report cited the emergence of the Sons of Iraq as a major reason for the downturn in civilian-oriented violence and deaths.
While death tolls are down, the report highlighted the negative influence Iran is having inside Iraq.
May 2008 marked a sharp drop in high-profile attacks from al Qaeda, according to the report.
