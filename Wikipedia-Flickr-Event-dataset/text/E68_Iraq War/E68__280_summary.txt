The message came from the head of Iran's elite al-Quds Force, Qassem Suleimani, and was conveyed by a senior Iraqi leader.
It read: "General Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassem Suleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, and Afghanistan.
Much of the US military's work with Iraq's Shia Muslims had been undermined by Suleimani and the client militias of the Iranian general's al-Quds force.
The senior Shia MP added: "He has managed to form links with every single Shia group, on every level.
The al-Quds Force has been involved in suppressing the Syrian uprising, according to multiple sources inside and outside the country.
