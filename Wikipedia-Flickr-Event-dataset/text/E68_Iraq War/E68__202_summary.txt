The recent surge in violence has some experts warning of a return to 2006, when the country plunged into a sectarian conflict so brutal that it was often described as a civil war.
In December 2012, for example, government forces arrested Sunni Finance Minister Rafia al-Issawi and his staff, prompting large protests.
But Iraqis were so badly scarred by the sectarian civil war, with so much lost on every side, that it's hard to imagine the wildfire catching again soon.
In addition, the civil war in Syria could also have a destabilizing effect on Iraq.
Iraqi officials, for their part, insist that the country isn't heading towards a full civil war.
