The United Nations Security Council has lifted restrictions prohibiting Iraq from pursuing a civilian nuclear program, in a step to help restore the country to the international standing it held before its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The council also took two other significant steps to recognize progress in Iraq.
In a unanimous vote Wednesday, the Security Council said it was lifting restrictions imposed in 1990 after then-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, because the situation is dramatically different today than when the measures were taken.
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who leads on Iraq policy in the Obama administration, chaired Wednesday's high-level session.
Vice President Biden said Iraq has made tremendous progress.
