Saddam 'caught like a rat' in a holeBAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Across the Tigris River from his opulent palaces, Saddam Hussein shuttered himself at the bottom of a narrow, dark hole beneath a two-room mud shack on a sheep farm, a U.S. military official said Sunday.
"He was in the bottom of a hole with no way to fight back," said Maj. Gen. Raymond Odierno.
That intelligence prompted U.S. soldiers to go to Adwar, about 15 kilometers (nine miles) from Tikrit, Saddam's ancestral home.
Even with reliable information, U.S. forces initially failed to grab Saddam in raids on two targets near Adwar.
By 9:15 p.m., Saddam was moved to an undisclosed location and soldiers continued to search the area.
