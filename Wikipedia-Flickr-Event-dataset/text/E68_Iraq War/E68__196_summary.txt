About 39,000 US troops remain in Iraq, down from a peak of 165,000 in 2008.
The US and Iraq were in "full agreement" on how to move forward, Mr Obama said, adding: "The US leaves Iraq with our heads held high."
The deadline for complete troop withdrawal by end of 2011 was set during former President George W Bush's term in office.
Mr Obama said the withdrawal comes amid changes in American military priorities, including a troop drawdown in Afghanistan, and new political realities in the Middle East and Africa.
