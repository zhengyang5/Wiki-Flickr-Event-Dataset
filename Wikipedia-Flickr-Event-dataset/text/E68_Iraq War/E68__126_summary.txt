The American official said that by Wednesday morning, American investigators still had not responded to multiple requests for information by Iraqi officials investigating the episode.
One American official who knew about the meeting cast doubt on the decision to move the diplomats out of a secure compound.
The Blackwater guards have told investigators that they believed that they were being fired on, the official familiar with the report said.
At some point during the shooting, one or more Blackwater guards called for a cease-fire, according to the American official.
In the end, a Blackwater guard “got on another one about the situation and supposedly pointed a weapon,” the official said.
