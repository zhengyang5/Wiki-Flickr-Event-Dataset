A majority of Iraqis actually welcome the US invasion on their country though the jury is still out on whether coalition troops should pull out immediately or stay back, according to an opinion poll conducted by NDTV in Baghdad.
• RIGHT: 54 • WRONG: 32 Should US troops stay on to rebuild Iraq • GO BACK: 52 • STAY ON: 43 All figures in per centages.
A more detailed analysis showed that the older Iraqis (over 40 years) Iraqis tend to be more pro-American and anti-Saddam.
And clearly while a large per cent of Muslims want the Americans to stay on, many Christians in Baghdad wanted an American presence in Baghdad to help rebuild the devastated country.
Terming the poll exercise as ‘‘not an easy task’’ NDTV said its six-member team led by Special Correspondents Ajai Shukla and Sanjay Ahirwal fanned out through the city of Baghdad, covering over 25 localities, meeting men and women on the streets of Baghdad.
