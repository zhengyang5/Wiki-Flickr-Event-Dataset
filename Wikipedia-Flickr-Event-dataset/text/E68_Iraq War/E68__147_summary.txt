Well before last year’s election in the United States, President Bush’s aides repeatedly said their goal was to make sure that Iraq would not be the first problem on the new president’s desk.
“And with Iraq seemingly more stable, it is possible that there could be some strategic progress.”The still unanswerable question is what kind of Iraq the last American troops will leave behind.
That does not mean that Iraq will become a satrapy of the United States either.
“I think the Americans are going too far to think that Iraq will emerge as a major ally in the region,” Mr. Alani of the Gulf Research Center said.
Given the alternatives, today’s Iraq might be the best strategic outcome the United States can hope for.
