In a last act of defiance Saddam Hussein refused to wear a hoodIraqi TV imagesIraqi state TV showed images of Saddam Hussein going to the gallows before dawn in a building his intelligence services once used for executions.
Footage broadcast later on Iraqi state TV showed a subdued Saddam Hussein being led to gallows by a group of masked men.
Saddam Hussein was led up onto the gallows platform and a dark piece of cloth placed around his neck, followed by the noose.
When the hangman stepped forward to put the hood over his head, Saddam Hussein made it clear he wanted to die without it.
But in Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, where a curfew was imposed, the news sparked protests from supporters.
