The Shiite-led government has mobilized thousands of troops to protect the pilgrims, who have been the targets of Sunni insurgents in the past.
The politician killed in the Mosul attack, Abdul-Karim al-Sharabi, was a high-level local official with the National Dialogue Front, a Sunni party that took part in last month’s provincial elections.
Mr. Sharabi was ambushed by gunmen and riddled with bullets as he drove to his office in the morning.
Four American soldiers and an Iraqi interpreter were killed in the city on Monday when a suicide car bomber attacked their convoy.
“This has allowed Al Qaeda to grow and fester in Mosul,” said Falah al-Luhaibi, the Sunni lawmaker.
