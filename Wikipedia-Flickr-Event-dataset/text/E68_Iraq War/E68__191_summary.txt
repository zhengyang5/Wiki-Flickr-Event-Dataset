Army Staff Sergeant Nicholas P. Ballard of El Paso, Texas and Sergeant Glenn M. Sewell of Live Oak, Texas were killed after their unit was hit by an I-E-D attack in eastern Iraq on Monday.
“He joined the military to put his wife through school,” said Ohlenforst.
This was his second tour in Iraq, a tour Ohlenforst says he volunteered for.
Glenn Sewell was 23-years-old and graduated from Judson High School where he played guitar and was on the academic decathlon team.
Sewell joined the Army in 2007 and was serving on his second tour in Iraq.
