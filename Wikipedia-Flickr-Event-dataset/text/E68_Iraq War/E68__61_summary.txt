Mr Fischer discarded a speech which had been written for him, and referred instead to his own brief notes.
Mr Rumsfeld maintained a grim face throughout, gazing at Mr Fischer through a tropical plant so that, as one observer put it, "he looked like a tiger in the jungle, ready to pounce".
But Mr Fischer, a thrice-married lapsed Catholic, had just had a private audience with Pope John Paul II in the Vatican.
The occasion had clearly bolstered his resolve to stand up to Mr Rumsfeld.
Yet the extraordinary element of Mr Fischer's confrontation with Mr Rumsfeld is that the foreign minister represents the pro-American wing of the German government.
