The Sunni tribal leader cooperating with the United States against al Qaeda in Iraq was killed in an improvised explosive device attack near his house in Anbar Province.
Though al Qaeda would have an interest in killing Abu Risha, no group has yet claimed responsibility for his death.
The IED blast occurred near Abu Risha's home, targeting his soft-skin SUV.
Following the attack, a second explosion occurred not far from the first, also intended for Abu Risha's party.
They had made the decision that they don't want to live under al Qaeda.
