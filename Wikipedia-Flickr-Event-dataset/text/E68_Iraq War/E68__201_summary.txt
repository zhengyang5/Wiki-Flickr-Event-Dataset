The warrant for Tariq al-Hashemi was issued under anti-terrorism laws, interior ministry officials said.
It came after bodyguards of Mr Hashemi who were arrested reportedly accused him of having links to terrorism.
The main Sunni political bloc has said it is boycotting cabinet in response.
Mr Hashemi has been an outspoken critic of Mr Maliki.
One man said he had been given $3,000 (Â£2,000) by Mr Hashemi himself.
