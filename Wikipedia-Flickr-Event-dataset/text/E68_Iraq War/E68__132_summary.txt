demands autonomy for Kurds in southern Turkey and has been attacking Turkish soil from Kurdish bases in Turkey and northern Iraq since 1984.
But the spokesman, Ahmad Danes, said the rebel group felt betrayed by the United States, which has said Turkey warned it of the raid.

And an Iraqi security forces source said an Iraqi Army major had been killed in clashes with elements of Al Qaeda.
