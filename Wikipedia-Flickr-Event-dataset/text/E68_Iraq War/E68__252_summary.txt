Posted: 06.12.06 Though Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, was killed by coalition forces this month, violence has continued in Iraq because of the complexity of insurgent groups.
Three-quarters of the group's attacks have been against U.S. forces and non-Iraqi contractors, the Washington Post reported.
The group is responsible for one of the deadliest insurgent attacks: a roadside bomb that killed 14 Marines in August 2005.
Al-Qaida in Iraq Perhaps the best known group, al-Qaida in Iraq, is a foreign terrorist organization driven by Islamic fundamentalism.
Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad said on the June 9 NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.
