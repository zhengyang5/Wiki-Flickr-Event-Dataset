Data SourcesThe IFHS is a two-stage, stratified survey of households, with an original target sample size of 10,080 households.
Population estimates for Iraq for the survey period were projected by the Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology.
The analysis period was divided into a pre-invasion period (January 2002 through February 2003) and a post-invasion period (March 2003 through June 2006).
The analysis of death rates among siblings was not used in the preparation of the final estimate of post-invasion deaths.
Methods proposed by Gakidou and King10 were adapted to adjust for two forms of bias in the estimation of death rates from data regarding the survival of siblings.
