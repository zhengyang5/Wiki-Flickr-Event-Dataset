Middle East Online BAGHDAD - Iraqi politicians backed by the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr on Saturday said they would lodge an official complaint about votes being excluded during last weekend's provincial elections.
The Sadrist movement also finished second in the Shiite-dominated provinces of Maysan, Najaf and Dhi Qar, south of Baghdad.
Kanani, however, alleged that many ballot boxes had been excluded from the official vote count.
The State of Law Coalition backed by Premier Maliki swept last weekend's polls, according to official preliminary results released by Iraq's Independent High Electoral Commission.
