The Iraqi defector codenamed Curveball, who falsely claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, admitted to the lies today and said he is proud he was able to trick the U.S. and its allies into launching the Iraq War.
I had the chance to fabricate something to topple the regime," Rafid al-Janabi told the British newspaper The Guardian in a report published today.
Al-Janabi had defected from Iraq to Germany in 1999 and told the German intelligence service, the BND, that Iraq possessed a mobile biological weapons program.
Al-Janabi said he made up the bio-weapons program in hopes the U.S. would push Saddam out of power, according to The Guardian.
Despite the thousands of U.S., allied and Iraqi soldiers and civilians that have perished in the conflict, al-Janabi told The Guardian he did the right thing.
