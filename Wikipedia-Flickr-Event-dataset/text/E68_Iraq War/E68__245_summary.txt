Specialist James Barker was one of four serving soldiers charged over the killings in the Iraqi town of Mahmudiya, which happened in March.
"This court sentences you to be confined for the length of your natural life, with the eligibility of parole," Lt Col Richard Anderson said.
A fifth man, former soldier Stephen Green, has been charged in a civilian court in Kentucky with murder and sexual assault.

Military prosecutors did not comment after the judgement was passed because the three other soldiers still face courts-martial.
