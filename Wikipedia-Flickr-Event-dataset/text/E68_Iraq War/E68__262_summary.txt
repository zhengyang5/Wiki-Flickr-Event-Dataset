India: Pro-America, Pro-BushLooking for some good news amid the often dismal findings about America’s image abroad?
Anti-Americanism has surged in much of the world since the beginning of the Iraq war in March 2003, but India has bucked the trend.
The 2005 Pew Global Attitudes survey found that about seven-in-ten Indians (71%) have a favorable view of the United States.
After India, Poland has the second largest share of respondents recommending the United States – and only one-in-five Poles (19%) suggests America as a destination.
Indians, however, are more supportive of Chinese economic power – 53% believe China’s growing economy is a good thing for India.
