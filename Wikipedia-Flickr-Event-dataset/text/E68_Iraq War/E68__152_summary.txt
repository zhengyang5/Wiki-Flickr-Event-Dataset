A senior Sunni tribal leader claimed Wednesday to have hundreds of documents proving fraud in weekend elections in Anbar province, escalating a crisis that has threatened to reignite violence in the former insurgent stronghold.
Anbar, once the heart of the insurgency before a decision by Sunni tribal leaders to turn against al-Qaida in Iraq, was one of 14 of the country's 18 provinces holding elections for local councils on Saturday.
He told Al-Arabiya television station that his group had "hundreds of documents" to prove the number of votes was inflated in Anbar.
Local electoral commission officials in Anbar could not immediately be reached for comment, and there was no way to independently verify the claims.
The statement said al-Sistani insisted that the newly elected officials should deliver services to the people.
