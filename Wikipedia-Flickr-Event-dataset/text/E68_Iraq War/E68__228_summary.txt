NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. war in Iraq has cost $1.7 trillion with an additional $490 billion in benefits owed to war veterans, expenses that could grow to more than $6 trillion over the next four decades counting interest, a study released on Thursday said.
The interest on expenses for the Iraq war could amount to about $4 trillion during that period, the report said.
The 2011 study found U.S. medical and disability claims for veterans after a decade of war totaled $33 billion.

Bucci, who was unconnected to the Watson study, agreed with its observation that the forecasts for the cost and duration of the war proved to be a tiny fraction of the real costs.
