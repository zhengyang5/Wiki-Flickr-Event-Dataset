Iraq to revive oil deal with ChinaBAGHDAD: Iraq and China are set to revive a US$1.2 billion oil deal that was canceled after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, the Iraq's oil ministry said Sunday.
An initial agreement with China is expected to be signed at the end of August to develop the billion-barrel Ahdab oil field south of Baghdad, the ministry said in a statement.
"Iraq and China are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the Ahdab oil field," it said.
No further details were released, but if the deal is signed it will be the first Saddam Hussein-era oil deal to be honored by the new Iraqi regime.
Iraq sits on more than 115 billion barrels of oil but decades of wars, U.N. sanctions, violence and sabotage have battered its oil industry.
