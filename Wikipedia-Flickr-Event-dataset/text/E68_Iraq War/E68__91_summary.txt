When I addressed you just over a year ago, nearly 12 million Iraqis had cast their ballots for a unified and democratic nation.
We thought that these elections would bring the Iraqis together, and that as we trained Iraqi security forces we could accomplish our mission with fewer American troops.
So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq.
Yet over time, we can expect to see Iraqi troops chasing down murderers, fewer brazen acts of terror, and growing trust and cooperation from Baghdad's residents.
Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops.
