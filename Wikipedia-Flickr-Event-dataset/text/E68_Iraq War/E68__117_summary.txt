The new results are also consistent with a late April Gallup Panel survey that found 57% of Americans in favor of setting a timetable for withdrawing troops.
(See "Americans Favor Iraq Timetable, but Not Necessarily a Speedy Withdrawal" in Related Items.)
An additional 27% would rather have withdrawal start sometime next year or beyond, while 39% oppose withdrawing troops by a certain time.
At the moment, Americans do not perceive that withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq on a timetable puts the United States at any greater risk of terrorism than it already faces.
One is a full-scale civil war in Iraq: A substantial minority (47%) says this will happen if the United States remains in Iraq, but an even larger proportion (68%) foresees it occurring if the United States leaves the country.
