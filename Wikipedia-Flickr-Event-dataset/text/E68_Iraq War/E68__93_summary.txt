"If the government wants to extend the presence of the multinational forces, it has to come to us in the parliament to convince us first," said the Sunni parliament speaker, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani.
The Shi'ite prime minister has said he wants Iraqi forces to take over the country's security but he has refused to demand a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces.
"I think the situation is clear ... when the Iraqi troops are ready and can control the country, the government will ask the multinational forces to leave," said one of his aides, George Bakus.
Only 144 of the 275 members of the Iraqi parliament were present but that was enough for a quorum.
Prominent Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman objected to the resolution and said during the session that "it is supposed that extension of the mandate of the forces should go with completing building the Iraqi forces."
