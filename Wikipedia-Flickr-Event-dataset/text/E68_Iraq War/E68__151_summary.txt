Iraq vote turnout fails to meet expectationsJust over half of the country's voters cast ballots in provincial elections, and turnout is as low as 40% in at least one province.
"Fifty-one percent is high turnout indeed for provincial elections," said Qasim Hasan Abodi, a judge and the chief officer of the commission.
"Very rarely in other parts of the world do you get such a high percentage in provincial elections."
This weekend's relatively low turnout was likely to help ruling parties, said Joost Hiltermann, a political expert with the International Crisis Group.
In past elections, Iraqis could choose among a number of polling stations to vote.
