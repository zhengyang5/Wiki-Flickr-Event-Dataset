World War II was the last war the United States fought with a formal declaration of war.
In understanding how war and constitutional norms became separated, we must begin with the first major undeclared war in American history (the Civil War was not a foreign war), Korea.
Truman’s view was that U.N. sanction for the war superseded the requirement for a declaration of war in two ways.
Nuclear war was seen as the most realistic war-fighting scenario, with all other forms of war trivial in comparison.
Just as nuclear weapons came to be called “strategic weapons” with other weapons of war occupying a lesser space, nuclear war became identical with war in general.
