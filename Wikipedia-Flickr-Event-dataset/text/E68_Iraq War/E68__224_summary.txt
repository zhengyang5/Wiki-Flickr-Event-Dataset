The non-political human rights campaign, aimed at saving the Assyrian people of Iraq from oblivion and helping them reclaim their rights, was launched in January 2005 by the former British Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey.
They were estimated at around one million before the recent exodus of Assyrians seeking refuge outside Iraq.
Despite the vast number of Iraqi Assyrian refugees living under terrible conditions, Darmoo was astonished "that there is yet no help whatsoever from any quarter."
"But we are not going to stop this time until we get our human rights," he told IPS.
"We plead to the world, and especially to all brothers and sisters from all sectors of Iraqi society, for protection and basic human rights," he said.
