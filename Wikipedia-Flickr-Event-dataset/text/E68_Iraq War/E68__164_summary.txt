Mr Maliki said the men had been hiding in a hole in the ground Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and US officials say two leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq have been killed in a joint Iraqi-US operation.
Mr Maliki said on national TV that the Iraqi al-Qaeda leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, who led an affiliate group, were dead.
The statement said Iraqi forces with US support had mounted a night-time raid on the al-Qaeda leaders' safe-house.
Mr Maliki said al-Qaeda had tried to camouflage Baghdadi by presenting several people with this name.
Mr Maliki is currently contesting the results of the 7 March election which was narrowly won by former prime minister Iyad Allawi.
