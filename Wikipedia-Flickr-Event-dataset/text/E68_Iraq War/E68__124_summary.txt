ISTANBUL — Turkey’s military said it bombed Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq before dawn on Sunday, as part of an American-sanctioned effort to weaken the Kurdish guerrilla group that hides there.
Turkish fighter jets struck targets in the regions of Zap, Avashin and Hakurk, along the border with Iraq, and the military followed up with artillery strikes, the Turkish military said in a statement on its Web site.
The strikes, which began around 1 a.m. local time and lasted for about three hours, also hit Qandil, an area farther inside Iraq, where some of the commanders for the Kurdish militant group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, known as the P.K.K., the initials of its Kurdish name, are believed to hide.

The first strikes, on Dec. 1, were artillery attacks from Turkish territory.
