Hood, Texas.Attacks by Iraqi soldiers and police against Americans are not unprecedented, especially in Mosul, a former al-Qaida haven and Iraq's third-largest city, located 225 miles (360 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad.In May 2009, two U.S. soldiers were killed and three were wounded in Mosul by a gunman wearing an Iraqi army uniform.
Three months earlier, two Iraqi policemen opened fire on U.S. soldiers and Iraqi police who were lunching at a Mosul police station.
The attack killed a U.S. soldier and his interpreter.Additionally, two U.S. soldiers were killed and six wounded Nov. 12, 2008, when an Iraqi trooper opened fire on them in an Iraqi outpost in Mosul.
The Iraqi was killed.And just one week after the U.S. military triumphantly announced it had withdrawn all but 50,000 troops to mark the end of the U.S. combat mission in Iraq, two American troops were killed by an Iraqi soldier during a visit to an Iraqi army base near Kirkuk, also in northern Iraq.
