Bush, Maliki Break Iraqi Law to Renew U.N.
The United Nations' mandate is a key part of maintaining that fiction.Last year, at Maliki's request, the Security Council renewed the U.N. mandate suddenly, surprising many of the Iraqi lawmakers we reached in Baghdad at the time.
It added: "The Iraqi parliament, as the elected representatives of the Iraqi people, has the exclusive right to approve and ratify international treaties and agreements including those signed with the United Nations Security Council.
"At the end of November, Foreign Affairs Minister Zebari was again called to testify before the Iraqi parliament.
He promised, unequivocally, that any request to extend the mandate "will not be presented to the U.N. Security Council prior to its submission to the Iraqi parliament for deliberation.
