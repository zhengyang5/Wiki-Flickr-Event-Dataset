Pioneered in May 1993, UNSCOM's "remote monitoring system" grew over the years to encompass more than 300 arms installations and research facilities in Iraq.
Iraq maintained that the United States and other unfriendly powers were using UNSCOM's access to the country for espionage.
The remote camera surveillance system has not operated since UNSCOM evacuated all personnel from Iraq in December, immediately before the U.S.-British military strikes.
If the United States did use UNSCOM cover for espionage, Ekeus added, "We have always stood against that."
He added: "The Iraq case was a unique case in history" because other arms control arrangements are voluntary.
