WikiLeaks intends to publish a massive collection of internal war logs from the United States military early Saturday morning.
Taken together, they represent a kind of diary of the Iraq war between 2004 and 2009.
The brief, matter-of-fact incident reports offer an unusual perspective on a war that lasted longer than World War II.
As such, many of the most sensational events in the Iraq war don't make an appearance, including the torture scandal at Abu Ghraib.
But there is one key difference between the Afghanistan war logs and these: The Iraq reports are all from a war that had already been officially declared as having been won.
