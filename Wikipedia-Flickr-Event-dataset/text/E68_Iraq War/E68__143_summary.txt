The agreement, approved by Iraq's parliament Thursday, calls for U.S. troops to withdraw from towns and cities by next summer and from Iraq by the end of 2011.
The pact required a simple majority of 138 votes in the 275-seat parliament for approval.
Sistani said the pact provided "no guarantee" that Iraq would regain sovereignty and questioned whether Iraq's assets would be protected under it.
All major Shiite, Kurdish and Sunni political parties voted in favor of the pact.
Loyalists of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, some smaller groups and a handful of Sunni lawmakers rejected it.
