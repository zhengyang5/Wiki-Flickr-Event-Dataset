Congressional Record: January 28, 2004 (Senate) Page S311-S312 NEW INFORMATION ON IRAQ'S POSSESSION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION Mr. NELSON of Florida.
There were other factors, but this information was very convincing to me that there was an imminent peril to the interests of the United States.
Is it any wonder that I concluded there was an imminent peril to the United States?
The first public disclosure of that information occurred perhaps a couple of weeks later, when the information was told to us.
That probably had a very salutary effect on the United States in that part of the world, that the United States will back up its intentions with force.
