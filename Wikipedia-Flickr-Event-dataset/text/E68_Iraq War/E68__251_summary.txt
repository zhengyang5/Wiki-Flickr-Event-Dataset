Ramadi, Falluja and Mosul are bastions of Sunni rebellion, while Iraqi southerners are overwhelmingly Shi'ite Muslims.
At least 66 people were killed and 114 wounded, police said, in a blast in the Shi'ite militia stronghold of Sadr City.
It was the bloodiest attack in Iraq in three months and by far the deadliest since bin Laden's lieutenant in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in a US air strike on June 7.
Around the time of the market bombing, a Sunni Arab member of parliament and seven of her guards were kidnapped by gunmen as they drove through another mainly Shi'ite area of Baghdad.
In a recording released a day before the explosion, bin Laden had urged vengeance for Zarqawi, a "lion of Jihad".
