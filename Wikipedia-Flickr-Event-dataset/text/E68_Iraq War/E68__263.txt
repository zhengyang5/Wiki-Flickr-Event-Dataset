A majority of Iraqis actually welcome the US invasion on their country though the jury is still out on whether coalition troops should pull out immediately or stay back, according to an opinion poll conducted by NDTV in Baghdad.

In what is billed as the first-ever opinion poll in the war-ravaged country in the last 25 years, 668 men and 332 women took part in the exercise conducted on April 22 and 23 in 25 different locations in the Iraqi capital.

Peoplespeak Was the US war to remove Saddam correct? • RIGHT: 54 • WRONG: 32 Should US troops stay on to rebuild Iraq • GO BACK: 52 • STAY ON: 43 All figures in per centages. Sample of 1,000 respondents in Iraq. Don’t knows not included. NDTV said the questionnaire included 8 questions including two on the perception about India for which the answers will be released later. Twelve per cent of all respondents were Christians.

As per the poll, a sizeable 54 per cent of the respondents believed that America did the right thing by invading Iraq while 32 per cent felt it was wrong. A more detailed analysis showed that the older Iraqis (over 40 years) Iraqis tend to be more pro-American and anti-Saddam.

To the question ‘‘Should America stay on and help re-build Iraq, or should they go back now?’’, 52 per cent wanted the US troops to return immediately while 43 per cent felt the they should stay on. And clearly while a large per cent of Muslims want the Americans to stay on, many Christians in Baghdad wanted an American presence in Baghdad to help rebuild the devastated country.

Terming the poll exercise as ‘‘not an easy task’’ NDTV said its six-member team led by Special Correspondents Ajai Shukla and Sanjay Ahirwal fanned out through the city of Baghdad, covering over 25 localities, meeting men and women on the streets of Baghdad.
