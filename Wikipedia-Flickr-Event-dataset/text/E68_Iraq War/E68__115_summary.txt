But as in the United States, Iraq's lawmakers are moving further away from the views of the government, particularly on the basic issue of the American presence in their country.
And even if such dates were fixed, it is unclear whether that would compel the United States to obey them.
Ali al-Adeeb, a lawmaker from the Dawa party and an aide to Maliki, said any timetable for American withdrawal should be accompanied by a timetable for training and equipping the Iraqi security forces.
"Pressures are increasing here in Iraq and also in the States for the withdrawal of the multinational forces.
"But it should happen gradually, so that Iraqi forces can handle the security tasks."
