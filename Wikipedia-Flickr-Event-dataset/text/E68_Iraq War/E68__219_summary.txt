Ready for IraqWith the momentum building towards a war with Iraq, Israel is on heightened alert in case Iraq tries to retaliate by attacking the Jewish state, as it did in the 1991 Gulf War.
Gen Yaalon told the Yediot Ahranot newspaper that he would be "very surprised" if America did not attack Iraq.
He said that if Iraq attacked Israel, the Jewish state would defend itself.
"To bring an explosives belt inside a mosque is a cynical use of the holy character of the site," local police chief Amihai Shai told Israel public radio.
