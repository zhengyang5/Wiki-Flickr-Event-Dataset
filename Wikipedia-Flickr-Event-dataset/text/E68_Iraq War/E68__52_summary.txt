Bush: Iraq is playing 'willful charade'Inspectors' report due FridayWASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush accused Iraq of engaging in a "willful charade" with U.N. weapons inspectors by hiding weapons of mass destruction and said that if the world fails to confront that threat, free nations would face "unacceptable risks."
As Bush was speaking, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell met with French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin and later sat down with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
At least 11 foreign ministers and one deputy foreign minister plan to attend, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
The announcement came amid a flurry of diplomatic meetings involving Powell, British Foreign Minister Jack Straw and Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacios.
Permanent Security Council members France, Russia and China could veto the proposal.
