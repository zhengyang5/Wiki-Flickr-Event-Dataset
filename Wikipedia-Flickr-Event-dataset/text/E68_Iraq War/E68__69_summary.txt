The Army's internal study of the war in Iraq criticizes some efforts by its own psychological operations units, but one spur-of-the-moment effort last year produced the most memorable image of the invasion.
As the Iraqi regime was collapsing on April 9, 2003, Marines converged on Firdos Square in central Baghdad, site of an enormous statue of Saddam Hussein.
And it was a quick-thinking Army psychological operations team that made it appear to be a spontaneous Iraqi undertaking.
"God bless them, but we were thinking ... that this was just bad news," the member of the psychological unit said.
"We didn't want to look like an occupation force, and some of the Iraqis were saying, 'No, we want an Iraqi flag!'
