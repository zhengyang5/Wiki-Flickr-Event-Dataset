His story is the centerpiece of a new book being published this week about the way the Bush White House is run.
In the book, O'Neill says that the president did not make decisions in a methodical way: there was no free-flow of ideas or open debate.
He also says that President Bush was disengaged, at least on domestic issues, and that disturbed him.
While in the book O'Neill comes off as constantly appalled at Mr. Bush, he was surprised when Stahl told him she found his portrait of the president unflattering.
"I will be really disappointed if they react that way because I think they'll be hard put to," says O'Neill.
