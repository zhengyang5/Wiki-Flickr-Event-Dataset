BAGHDAD — Two American soldiers were killed and nine were wounded on Tuesday when a firefight erupted inside an Iraqi Army base north of Baghdad, American and Iraqi officials said. They were the first American casualties since President Obama declared an official end to the United States combat mission in Iraq a week ago.

The attack took place during a meeting between an American company commander, with his retinue of security guards, and Iraqi soldiers at a small base described as a commando compound near the city of Tuz Khurmato in Salahuddin Province.

During the meeting an Iraqi soldier fired on the Americans and was himself shot and killed, the American military said in a statement.

Two days earlier, American soldiers in Baghdad joined in repulsing a highly coordinated attack by insurgents on one of the main military commands in Baghdad, an event that underscored the ambiguities of the new phase of the American military role in Iraq.
