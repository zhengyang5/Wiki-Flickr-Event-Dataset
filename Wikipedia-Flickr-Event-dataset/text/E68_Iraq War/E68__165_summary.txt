The trade bank was established after the United States-led invasion in 2003 to help finance reconstruction efforts and international trade.
The bank’s chairman, Hussein al-Uzri, said in a statement that the bombings had killed five bank guards and wounded six other employees.
PhotoThe car bombs might have been directed at a convoy driving into the bank’s entrance at about 11 a.m., Iraqi Army officers at the scene said.
“We were trying to put out the fire in a car and to rescue victims,” he said.
Also on Sunday, the Iraqi authorities said they had found the decomposing bodies of seven people inside a house in central Baghdad.
