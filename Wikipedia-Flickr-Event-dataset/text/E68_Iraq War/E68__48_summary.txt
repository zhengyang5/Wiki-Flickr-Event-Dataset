Transcript of Blix's U.N. presentation(CNN) -- Following is a transcript of chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix's March 7 presentation to the U.N. Security Council on the progress of the inspection effort in Iraq.
Mr. President, Iraq, with a highly developed administrative system, should be able to provide more documentary evidence about its proscribed weapons programs.
In this, as in other matters, the inspection work is moving on and may yield results.
Resolution 1284 instructs UNMOVIC to, I quote, "address unresolved disarmament issues," and to identify "key remaining disarmament tasks."
Neither governments nor inspectors would want disarmament inspection to go on forever.
