Three fields were offered by midmorning on Tuesday but only one deal was struck, as several foreign companies rejected the terms laid down by the government.
But Mahmoud Almusafir, a former Iraqi diplomat, told Al Jazeera that there were still questions over the transparency of oil contracts in the country.
The country's oil industry has suffered from years of neglect and sanctions, and Iraq is hoping foreign investment will bring in the expertise to help raise production levels.
The oil deposits, holding known reserves of 43 billion barrels of crude, are in southern and northern Iraq while the gas concessions are west and northeast of Baghdad.
"This raises the question of the profitability of the contract," a source involved in the bidding told the AFP news agency.
