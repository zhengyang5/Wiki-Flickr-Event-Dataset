US troops are training Iraqi forcesPaul Wolfowitz told a senate committee the troops were those whose tour of duty was extended last month to bolster security for the 30 January election.
But Mr Wolfowitz said Iraq had a "very difficult road ahead" and the US would keep 135,000 troops there during 2005.
'Countless challenges'Speaking before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr Wolfowitz repeated that the US administration would set no timetable for American forces to withdraw from Iraq.
Mr Wolfowitz said the US military was training Iraqi security forces, but this had encountered "countless challenges and suffered numerous setbacks" and much work "clearly needs to be done".
Mr Wolfowitz said it was "a worthwhile trade-off," to keep US forces deployed in Iraq longer if that led to capable Iraqi security forces being fielded faster.
