Weeping relatives of a murdered Iraqi family confronted the killer on Thursday in an American courtroom and said he deserved to die.
The object of their outrage, former Private First Class Steven Dale Green, convicted of murder and rape, apologised and said he will face "God's justice".
In a hearing that turned emotional at times, surviving members of the al-Janabi family gestured and questioned Green, convicted earlier this month of killing four people in Iraq.
Hajia al-Janabi, the grandmother of two victims, tried to approach Green at the defence table.
Green, speaking publicly for the first time since his arrest nearly three years ago, told his victims' relatives that he will face "God's justice" after spending the rest of his life in prison.
