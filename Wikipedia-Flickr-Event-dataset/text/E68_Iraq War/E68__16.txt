"The mission [in Iraq] has became more dangerous for the Polish contingent. The patrol was attacked by means of a booby trap. The wounded were transported to the Polish base hospital but their livers are not endangered" Gen. Koziej informed.



"The IED can be detonated from a long distance, so the terrorists could choose the moment for the explosion" the spokesman of Ministry explained.

According to Poland's Defence Ministry, the attack took place in the north-eastern part of the city of ad Diwaniya, a few kilometres from the Echo base at around 10.40 p.m. local time.
