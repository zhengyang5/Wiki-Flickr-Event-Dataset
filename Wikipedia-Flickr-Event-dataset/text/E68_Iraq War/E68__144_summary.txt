After June 2009 looms May 2010, 16 months after Mr. Obama’s inauguration, the month he set during the campaign to have American combat forces out of Iraq entirely.
Next comes December 2011, the deadline in the status-of-forces agreement to have all American troops out of Iraq.
“The bullets don’t have ‘adviser’ stenciled on some and ‘combat unit’ on another.”There are 146,000 American troops in Iraq, including service and support personnel.
Military officials say they can accomplish that by “repurposing” whatever combat troops remain.
But combat troops can be given different missions.
