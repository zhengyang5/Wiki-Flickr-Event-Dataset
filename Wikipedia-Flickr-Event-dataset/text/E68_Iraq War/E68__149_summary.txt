NAJAF, Iraq, Jan. 16 -- Gunmen on Friday ambushed a car carrying a leading candidate in Iraq's provincial elections, killing him and wounding four of his guards, officials said.
The contest has proceeded relatively peacefully in the south, where Dawa has sought to capitalize on the prime minister's popularity and encroach on the power that the Supreme Council has wielded there since the last elections in 2005.
Of the nine largely Shiite southern provinces, home to the sacred cities of Najaf and Karbala, the Supreme Council controls at least four, with an influential presence in the rest.
Husseini, 48, head of the town council in nearby Mahawil, was a leading candidate on Maliki's list.
The assassination is the first in Iraq since late December, when Mowaffaq al-Hamdani, another candidate, was killed in the tense town of Mosul in northern Iraq.
