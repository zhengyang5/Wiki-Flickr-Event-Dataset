Anti-war veterans' group: War crimes are 'encouraged' RAW STORYPublished: Monday January 21, 2008del.icio.us |Print This Email This At an event in Watertown, New York on Saturday, members of Iraq Veterans Against War charged that war crimes against civilians were encouraged by unit commanders.
Named after the 1971 event in which John Kerry read testimony from soldiers on atrocities they had committed, this year's Winter Soldier will feature Iraq War veterans speaking about war crimes they committed or witnessed.
Others have previously questioned US attacks that have killed civilians, though not as sharply.
The rate of Western-caused civilian deaths between January and June exceeded the same measure for all of 2006.
In that same year, the group found at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed as a result of Taliban attacks.
