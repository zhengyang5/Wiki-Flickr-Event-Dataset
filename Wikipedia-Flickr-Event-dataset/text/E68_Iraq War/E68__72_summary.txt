(Reuters) - Most of the U.S. military deaths in the Iraq war, which have hit a milestone of 2,000 since the American-led invasion in March 2003, occurred after President Bush declared "major combat operations" over in May 2003.
Following is a look at some facts and figures on U.S. Iraq war casualties.
About 93 percent of U.S. military deaths have occurred since then in a guerrilla war with insurgents who rose up after President Saddam Hussein was toppled.
