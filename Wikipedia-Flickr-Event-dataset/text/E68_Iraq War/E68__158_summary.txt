Eighty-eight civilians were killed this month in violence, health ministry data showed, the first time the monthly bodycount has dropped below 100.
"These statistics are the lowest since the invasion," said an Interior Ministry official, asking not to be identified.
The civilian death toll in Iraq has been gradually falling for two years as the sectarian warfare unleashed between once dominant Sunni Muslims and majority Shi’ites by the U.S. invasion began to subside.
The October bombings took that month’s civilian bodycount to 343, compared to 125 in September — the previous lowest monthly toll of the war.
At least 100,000 Iraqis have been killed through violence in the more than 6-1/2 years since the invasion, according to www.iraqbodycount.org.
