During the interview, Al-Dari cautiously avoided adopting what could be interpreted as a sectarian discourse but argued that there are forms of ethnic cleansing occurring in Iraq.
The occupation forces together with the security forces would conduct their night raids and no one could do anything about it.
The occupation created a lot of problems, such as the side struggles that are taking place in Iraq ... Iraq has become the battleground for settling accounts.
So what we're seeing is not a civil war but ethnic cleansing?
There is ethnic, sectarian and political cleansing and it is executed by [Iraq's] security forces.
