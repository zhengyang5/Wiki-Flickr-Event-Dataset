THE United States is recruiting Sunni Arabs to protect neighbourhoods across a wide area of central Iraq.
Both made it clear the US saw the creation of the so-called Guardian forces as a major initiative to improve security.
At the same time, the Sunni tribes have armed wings, and a wide spectrum of insurgent groups and criminal gangs also wield the power of the gun.

Asked whether he supported the Guardian program, whether he thought it should be put in place countrywide and whether he thought it could improve security, General Petraeus replied: "Yes, yes and yes."
