Kurdish peshmerga forces have been in Kirkuk for a long time, but they did not have the prominent presence in the city like now.
The [insurgent] fighters reached Kirkuk's edges yesterday but they did not try to sweep to the city centre.
This move by the fighters has alarmed the peshmerga forces and made them call up more numbers.
I just got back home after a trip to the city centre.
The fighters are mainly at Hawija town in Kirkuk, which is predominantly inhabited by Arab tribes.
