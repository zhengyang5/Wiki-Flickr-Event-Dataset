The agreement calls for Iraq to prosecute U.S. troops according to court procedures that have yet to be worked out.
Those negotiations, administration officials have argued, could take three years, by which time the U.S. will have withdrawn from Iraq under the terms of the agreement.
Sunni lawmaker Omar Abdul Sattar said Tuesday that Tawafuq, the Sunni alliance, wants a pledge that the Americans will not implement articles in the security agreement that Tawafuq considers vague.
"The government should be committed to the results of the referendum, whether people will accept the (security agreement), or reject it," Sattar said.
The Sunnis said they plan to submit their proposal Wednesday as a resolution that would be separate from the vote on the security agreement, which also is due for a vote Wednesday.
