CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. – President Barack Obama consigned the Iraq war to history Friday, declaring he will end combat operations within 18 months and open a new era of diplomacy in the Middle East.
Like Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon before him, Obama came into office with an inherited war he pledged to end without delay.
Meantime, Obama is accelerating the end of the war by withdrawing roughly 100,000 troops by the summer of 2010.
Obama was moving to fulfill in large measure the defining promise of his campaign  to end combat operations within 16 months of taking office.
In Iraq, where several TV stations showed Obama's speech live, some citizens applauded the ironclad withdrawal plan while others questioned whether Iraq could defend itself alone.
