The deaths came at the end of the bloodiest month for U.S. troops in Iraq in two years, and with just six months before the American military is scheduled to leave after more than eight years of war.
Wednesday's rocket attack struck a U.S. base in southern Iraq that is located a few miles from the Iranian border, a U.S. military official said.
The U.S. military is preparing to leave Iraq by the end of the year, as required by a 2008 security agreement between Baghdad and Washington.
In all, 15 U.S. troops have died this month in Iraq, all but one in hostile attacks.
Wednesday's deaths bring to 4,469 the number of American troops who have died in Iraq.
