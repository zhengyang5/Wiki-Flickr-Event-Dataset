The first brigade of Soldiers to deploy exclusively in support of Operation New Dawn has arrived in southern Iraq.
They are replacing 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, one of the first heavy brigade combat teams configured for an advise and assist role.
Advise and assist operations are not new to United States Division-South units operating in southern Iraq.
"Iraqi Security Forces have been and will continue to be the lead provider of security today and into the future," Brooks added.
The 3rd ACR, as an advise and assist brigade, will begin duties in five provinces by the end of September.
