Iraqi Refugee ProcessingPart of the humanitarian mission of the USRAP is to provide resettlement opportunities to especially vulnerable Iraqi refugees.
Since large-scale Iraqi refugee processing was announced in February 2007, DHS and DOS have worked cooperatively to increase the number of Iraqi refugees admitted to the United States as part of the worldwide commitment.
DHS and DOS have worked closely to expand processing capacity for Iraqi refugee applicants while ensuring the highest level of security.
USCIS has interviewed 142,670 Iraqi refugee applicants; approved 119,202 for resettlement and, 84,902 Iraqi refugees have arrived in the United States.
USCIS officers have previously interviewed Iraqi refugee applicants in Syria as well, but have not been able to work in Syria to process refugee applications since March 2011.
