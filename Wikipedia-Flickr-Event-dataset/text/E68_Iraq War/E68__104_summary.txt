The White House, which has held up the movement in Anbar province as an example for the rest of Iraq, condemned his assassination as "an outrage".
Abu Risha was killed, along with two bodyguards, by a roadside bomb planted near his home in Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's western Anbar province.
"This is a spontaneous popular uprising against al-Qaeda, because, as you know, al-Qaeda killed our people," he told al-Arabiya TV this week.
Anbar province was once controlled by the insurgents, and was where they declared an "Islamic State of Iraq".
But the tribal alliance managed to force the insurgents back and reduce violence in the province dramatically.
