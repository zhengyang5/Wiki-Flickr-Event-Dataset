The last shipment of M1A1 Abrams tanks arrived mid-August completing the Government of Iraq's purchase of 140 tanks through a Foreign Military Sales agreement with the United States.
Upon arrival the tanks are secured at the BCTC where they are unpackaged and tested before their transition to the Iraqi army.
If they should find anything wrong due to the shipment process, they will fix the issue before turning them over to the Iraqi army."
The tanks will be distributed evenly within the four Iraqi Army tank regiments of the 9th Iraqi Army Mechanized Division.
"The M1A1 tanks provides the Iraqi army with the capability of defending its borders to protect the sovereignty of Iraq," said Bliese.
