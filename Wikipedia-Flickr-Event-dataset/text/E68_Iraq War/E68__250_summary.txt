At least 36 more Iraqi civilians, security force members and officials were killed Thursday in attacks that underscored the ruthlessness and growing randomness of much of the violence.
Interior Ministry statistics showed 12,000 civilians killed by insurgents in the last year and a half, Jabr said.
The figure breaks down to an average of more than 20 civilians killed by bombings and other attacks each day.
No official totals have been released for those dead, or for the total number of civilian casualties since the start of the war.
Jabr said the government figures showed that Shiites had suffered the bulk of insurgent attacks.
