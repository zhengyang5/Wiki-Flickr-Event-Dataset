AFP - Gunmen dressed in Iraqi army uniforms launched two execution-style attacks west of Baghdad on Monday, killing 13 members of a tribe who took up arms against Al-Qaeda, a villager and security official said.
"They killed three of his sons and four cousins," he said, adding that all those killed were members of the Zubaa tribe.
"It was a group of Al-Qaeda and they were wearing Iraqi army uniforms," Zubaie said.
The Sahwa, knows as the Sons of Iraq by the US military, are widely credited with turning the tide of the war against Al-Qaeda.
But dozens of Sahwa members have been arrested in recent months amid warnings that they have no immunity from prosecution.
