Sheiks aligned with Saleh al-Mutlaq's election slate, which won the highest percentage of votes in Anbar Province, discussed strategy on Saturday in Ramadi, Iraq.
And still Faris Taha, one of the election's victors, according to preliminary results, is too fearful to return to the region he will soon represent.
"I cannot go back," he said, having retreated from his hometown east of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, to a hotel in Baghdad's Green Zone.
Instead, the Islamic Party stood accused of stuffing ballot boxes and reporting inflated results from some polling stations.
The central election commission rejected some ballots before announcing preliminary results in Baghdad last Thursday, party officials said.
