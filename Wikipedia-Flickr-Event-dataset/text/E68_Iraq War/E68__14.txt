It is with very deep regret that the Ministry of Defence has confirmed the following fatalities suffered during Operation TELIC.

As at 12 February 2009, a total of 179 British Armed Forces personnel or MOD civilians have died serving on Operation TELIC since the start of the campaign in March 2003.

Of these, 136 were killed as a result of hostile action.

43 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents, or have not yet officially been assigned a cause of death pending the outcome of an investigation.

The balance of these figures may change as inquests are concluded. A more detailed breakdown of fatalities and casualties can be found here.
