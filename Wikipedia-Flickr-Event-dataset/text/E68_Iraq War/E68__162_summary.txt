"This action demonstrates the improved security, strength and capacity of Iraqi security forces," Biden said during a press conference Monday.
"The Iraqis led this operation, and it was based on intelligence the Iraqi security forces themselves developed."
Al-Masri became the head of Al Qaeda in Iraq after its former leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in June of 2006.
Odierno said that Iraqi intelligence services and U.S. special forces operations have continued to "degrade" Al Qaeda in Iraq over the past few months.
"There is still work to do but this is a significant step forward in ridding Iraq of terrorists," he said.
