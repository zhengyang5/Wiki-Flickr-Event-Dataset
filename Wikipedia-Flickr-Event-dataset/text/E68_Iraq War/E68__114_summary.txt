Iraq takes control of Basra from British armyBASRA, Iraq (AFP) â€” Iraq formally took security control of the southern oil province of Basra from British forces on Sunday, paving the way for Britain to sharply reduce its nearly 5,000-strong troop presence.
Basra, the ninth of Iraq's 18 provinces to be returned to local control by the US-led coalition, is the fourth and final province under British control since the 2003 invasion to be transferred.
Iraqi forces were heavily deployed in Basra to thwart any insurgent attacks, while helicopters patrolled the skies, an AFP correspondent said.
"It is a testament to the growing capacity of the Iraqi security forces, and to Iraqi readiness to step up and assume responsibility," he said.
Following the handover, British troops will provide specialist backup to Iraqi forces, such as patrolling the border with Iran and carrying out economic activities.
