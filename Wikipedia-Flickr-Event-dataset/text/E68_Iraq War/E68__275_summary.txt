For more than a year, U.S. forces in Iraq have secretly detained dozens of suspected Iranian agents, holding them for three to four days at a time.
The country's nuclear work was advancing, U.S. allies were resisting robust sanctions against the Tehran government, and Iran was aggravating sectarian violence in Iraq.
Three officials said that about 150 Iranian intelligence officers, plus members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Command, are believed to be active inside Iraq at any given time.
There is no evidence the Iranians have directly attacked U.S. troops in Iraq, intelligence officials said.
Tehran insists that its nuclear program is peaceful, but the United States and other nations say it is aimed at developing weapons.
