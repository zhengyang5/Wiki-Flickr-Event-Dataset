Foreign hostages in Iraq

CBC News Online | June 22, 2006



More than 200 foreigners have been kidnapped in Iraq. Kidnappers have demanded the release of Iraqi prisoners, the withdrawal of troops, and ransoms for the hostages' release. Some have been released, but about one-third of them have been killed. Others are believed to be still held hostage in Iraq.



Several Canadians have been kidnapped, including two peace activists on Nov. 26, 2005.

As well, hundreds of Iraqis have been kidnapped and held for ransom, a common occurrence that largely goes unreported. Iraqi militants have also kidnapped and killed Iraqi soldiers.

Many foreign hostages have also been released from Iraq.



Canadian Naji al Kawaiti was taken hostage April 3, 2004. His captors demanded a $50,000 ransom. Al Kawaiti was released May 4, 2004. The Department of Foreign Affairs said its officials played an important role in the release.



Iraqi militants freed Filipino truck driver Angelo de la Cruz on July 20, 2004, two weeks after taking him hostage to force the Philippine government to pull its troops from Iraq. De la Cruz was dropped off on the steps of the United Arab Emirates' Embassy in Baghdad. The Philippines withdrew its 51 soldiers from Iraq a month early on July 16 to meet the demands.



French journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot disappeared Aug. 20, 2004, as they were heading to Najaf. They were initially held in a suburb of Baghdad, but moved to four other locations before being released Dec. 22, 2004. The French government said the release was negotiated through intermediaries and denied paying a ransom.



Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian journalist, was kidnapped outside a Baghdad mosque on Feb. 4, 2005. Iraqi militants threatened on an online bulletin board to kill Sgrena unless Italy withdrew its 3,000 troops from Iraq. On Feb. 16, the Associated Press received a videotape showing Sgrena pleading for her life, asking the Italian government to "end the occupation."



Sgrena was released March 4, after Italian intelligence officer Nicola Calipari negotiated with her captors. Shortly after her release, U.S. soldiers fired on the car carrying her and Calipari as it approached a checkpoint. Calipari was killed and Sgrena was hit in the shoulder by shrapnel. Calipari had shielded Sgrena from the gunfire with his body.



Sgrena later suggested the U.S. soldiers wanted to kill her. Soldiers at the checkpoint said the car was speeding toward them and ignored orders to stop. An Italian investigation concluded that stress and inexperience on the soldiers' part led to Calipari's death, but that his death was not deliberate.



Three Romanian journalists and their Iraqi-American guide were freed in late May 2005 after nearly two months in captivity in Iraq. They had appeared on Al-Jazeera saying they would be killed if Romania failed to withdraw its troops.



Florence Aubenas, a French reporter for the daily Libération, and her Iraqi interpreter and guide, Hussein Hanoun, were released in June 2005 after being held hostage for five months.



In mid-June 2005, Australian Prime Minister John Howard announced that Douglas Wood, a 63-year-old engineering consultant, had been rescued in a military operation. Wood had been held for six weeks in Iraq. Shortly after Wood's capture, his abductors gave the Australian government an ultimatum to pull its troops from Iraq or he would be killed.



In January 2006, Jill Carroll, a freelance reporter for the Christian Science Monitor, was grabbed when gunmen ambushed her car and killed her translator shortly after she left the offices of a Sunni Arab politician. On Jan. 17, Al Jazeera aired a videotape of Carroll. An accompanying message said Carroll would be killed unless the U.S. released all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours. Carroll
