British ministers are increasingly optimistic that a non-military solution will be found but are anxious to keep the pressure on President Saddam by making it clear that force will be used if necessary.
But Mr Bush was given broad backing from leaders of the US House of Representatives when they gave a green light to the use of American forces "as necessary and appropriate" against Iraq.
Mr Bush warned that Baghdad had a narrow window of time in which to comply with United Nations resolutions and said that the use of force could soon become "unavoidable".
Britain is pushing for a compromise new UN resolution on Iraq that answered French demands for a two-stage process before military action.
He urged the international community to continue to seek a UN solution and suggested that Mr Bush was pursuing this route only because of Mr Blair's pressure.
