PART OF A LARGER TRENDThe United States has rapidly increased its arms sales to Iraq over the last several years.
With the $10.9 billion deal announced in July, the United States has completed approximately $20 billion in arms sales agreements with Iraq since 2005.
The United States is already the unparalleled leader in arms sales agreements to the Middle East.
As a March 2008 analysis by the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation detailed, the United States was responsible for 56% of all arms sales agreements with Middle Eastern countries from 1999 to 2006.
Since 2005, the United States averaged $4.9 billion per year in arms sales with Iraq.
