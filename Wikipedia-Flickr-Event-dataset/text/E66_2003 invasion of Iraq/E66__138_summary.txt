U.S. military: Iraqis captured, murdered soldier in the 507thSALEM, Ore. (AP)  A soldier in the same ambush as former POW Jessica Lynch was not killed in action but captured by Iraqi fighters and then executed, officials said.
"He was executed — shot twice in the back," Maj. Arnold Strong, a Guard spokesman, said in a telephone interview Thursday.
Investigators, Strong said, "have a pool of suspects," presumed to be members of the Fedayeen paramilitary force who captured Walters.
Lynch was rescued from an Iraqi hospital April 1, 2003, while seven others captured in the ambush were freed 12 days later.
Empty gun magazines were found near where Walters was captured, suggesting he fired until ammunition ran out.
