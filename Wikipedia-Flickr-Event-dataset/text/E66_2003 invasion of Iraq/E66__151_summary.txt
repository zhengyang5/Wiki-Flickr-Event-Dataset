Misperceptions, the Media and the Iraq War October 2, 2003 Study Finds Widespread Misperceptions on IraqHighly Related to Support for War Full ReportQuestionnaireA new study based on a series of seven US polls conducted from January through September of this year reveals that before and after the Iraq war, a majority of Americans have had significant misperceptions and these are highly related to support for the war in Iraq.
Among those with none of the misperceptions listed above, only 23% support the war.
Among those with one of these misperceptions, 53% support the war, rising to 78% for those who have two of the misperceptions, and to 86% for those with all 3 misperceptions.
Steven Kull, director of PIPA, comments, "While we cannot assert that these misperceptions created the support for going to war with Iraq, it does appear likely that support for the war would be substantially lower if fewer members of the public had these misperceptions."
In the run-up to the war misperceptions were also highly related to support for going to war.
