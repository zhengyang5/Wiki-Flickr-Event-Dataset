Coalition planes hit Iraq sites in no-fly zoneLeaflets warning Iraqis dropped in southern areaINCIRLIK AIR BASE, Turkey (CNN) -- U.S.-British coalition aircraft bombed Iraqi air-defense sites in the northern no-fly zone Thursday in response to anti-aircraft fire, officials said.
Meanwhile, coalition planes dropped leaflets in the southern no-fly zone warning the Iraqis not to repair damaged air defense sites.
In the northern zone, coalition patrols attacked sites south of Tall Afar after the Iraqis fired at the planes, said Capt.
Other fliers said that the no-fly zone enforcement protects Iraqis and warned that airstrikes could follow any threats on coalition aircraft.
The leaflet drop was the fifth in the southern no-fly zone in the past two months.
