Iraqi lawyer's courage leads Marines to LynchBy David J. Lynch, USA TODAYRelated story: Rescued soldier doing well after first surgery) MARINE COMBAT HEADQUARTERS, Iraq Â— The daring rescue that freed American POW Jessica Lynch on Tuesday originated with a tip from a genial Iraqi lawyer who couldn't stomach seeing a woman hit.
Lynch, 19, was seized March 23 along with 14 other soldiers when their supply convoy took a wrong turn as it passed the southern Iraqi town of Nasiriyah.
As he passed a first-floor emergency ward, he saw through the window an Iraqi paramilitary man give Lynch two open-handed slaps to the face.
Mohammed had to walk more than 6 miles out of Nasiriyah, along an open road in an area that Marines have nicknamed "Ambush Alley."
That piqued the interest of a young Marine shouldering an M-16, who then ushered the Iraqi to see his superior officer.
