On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein's ability to wage war.
Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense.
I want Americans and all the world to know that coalition forces will make every effort to spare innocent civilians from harm.
A campaign on the harsh terrain of a nation as large as California could be longer and more difficult than some predict.
And you can know that our forces will be coming home as soon as their work is done.
