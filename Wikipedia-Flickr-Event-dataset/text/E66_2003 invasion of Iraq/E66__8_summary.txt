On Thursday night, Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, confidently predicted that, should a war erupt, the Iraqi army would soon surrender in the face of overwhelming US force.
You have always got to hope for minimum loss of life in any war, but Mr Rumsfeld's prognosis about the speed of an Iraqi army collapse is ideologically driven and strategically ill-informed.
After the Gulf war defeat, the Iraqi army was cut to less than half its original size.
Like Washington, President Saddam is also aware of the dangers the Iraqi armed forces pose to his continued rule.
An invading US army will face 375,000 Iraqi troops and 2,200 tanks.
