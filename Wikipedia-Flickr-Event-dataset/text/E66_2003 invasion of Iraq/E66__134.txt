Civilians fired on in Basra: UK

Updated

British military officials claim Iraqi forces have opened fire on civilians trying to flee the southern city of Basra in their thousands.

"The Black Watch are engaging them and doing their best to protect the civilians," Flight Lieutenant Peter Darling told AFP, referring to the Scottish regiment.

Lt Darling says it is not known if any civilians have been wounded in the firing.

The scale of the shooting by the Iraqi forces loyal to President Saddam Hussein, who have been surrounded by US and British troops, is also unclear.

"We do not have any information about casualties yet."

Another British spokeswoman, Flight Lieutenant Emma Thomas, put the number of civilians trying

to flee at "two to three thousand."

"They are known to be trying to flee from the west," she told AFP.

"We have been trying to return fire. Obviously it is difficult because we are trying to avoid civilian casualties."

British forces claim to have surrounded the city but have continued to meet resistance from Iraqi militia.

The Black Watch destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks which had tried to break out of the cordon surrounding Basra yesterday.

Another British spokesperson says the troops are setting up aid centres on the outskirts of Basra with food and water for hundreds of fleeing civilians after pledging to give them "safe passage" out of the city.

"We are setting up centres, giving them basics - food and water," Major Will MacKinlay told AFP.

"We have troops all around Basra. They (the civilians) could be leaving in any direction."
