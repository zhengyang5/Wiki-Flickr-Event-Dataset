\"In the months leading up to the war, it was a steady drumbeat of weapons of mass destruction,\" said Senator Lincoln D. Chafee, a Republican.
The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee agreed in June to broaden the scope of its probe into IraqÂ’s alleged WMDs and whether intelligence had been exaggerated to justify war.
\'Gross Exaggeration\'Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Democrat, charged that the Bush administration had \"grossly exaggerated\" the connection between Iraq and the global war on terrorism.
\"In my view, the overemphasis on Iraq has caused a serious erosion of our ability to go after the actual [terrorist] operatives,\" he stressed.
Senators from both the Republican and Democratic parties further demanded the Bush administration to seriously consider seeking a second U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing greater U.N. participation in postwar Iraq, both in peacekeeping and reconstruction.
