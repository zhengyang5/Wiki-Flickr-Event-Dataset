For Immediate ReleaseOffice of the Press SecretaryMarch 22, 2003President Discusses Beginning of Operation Iraqi FreedomPresident's Radio AddressTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning.
American and coalition forces have begun a concerted campaign against the regime of Saddam Hussein.
In this conflict, American and coalition forces face enemies who have no regard for the conventions of war or rules of morality.
I want Americans and all the world to know that coalition forces will make every effort to spare innocent civilians from harm.
Our entire nation appreciates the sacrifices made by military families, and many citizens who live near military families are showing their support in practical ways, such as by helping with child care, or home repairs.
