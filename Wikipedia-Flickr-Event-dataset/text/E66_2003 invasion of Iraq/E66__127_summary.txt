Then as now the battalion belongs to the 1st Regiment of the famed 1st Marine Division – “The Old Breed” – the core of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force headquartered at Camp Pendleton .
When the shooting stopped one Marine was dead and another wounded, arguably the first casualties of the second Iraq war.
It was assigned to Regimental Combat Team 1 – tasked to drive up Route 7 to Baghdad as part of the 1st Marine Division commanded by Maj Gen James N. Mattis.
Lost in the massive convoy following behind was Third Platoon, an insignificant cog in the 1st Marine Division.
Occasionally the cameras would pan to a dead Iraqi,Third Platoon Marine Alex Nicoll offers a vivid account of the action.
