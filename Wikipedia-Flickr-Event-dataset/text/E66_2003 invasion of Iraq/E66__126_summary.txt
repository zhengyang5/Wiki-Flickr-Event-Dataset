A US Pentagon report said Russia passed details through its Baghdad ambassador.
One piece of intelligence passed on was false, and in fact helped a key US deception effort, the report said.
Surprise attackThe false intelligence apparently passed on by Russia concerned the date the US was likely to start its main attack on Baghdad.
Saddam 'interference'The report also said Saddam Hussein's inept military leadership was a key factor in the defeat of his forces.
The 210-page report - Iraqi Perspectives Project - aims to help US officials understand in hindsight how the Iraqi military prepared for and fought during the invasion.
