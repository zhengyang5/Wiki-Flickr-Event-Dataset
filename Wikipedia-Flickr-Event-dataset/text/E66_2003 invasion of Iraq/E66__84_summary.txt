The Associated Press March 26, 2003Saddam counts on Republican Guard as last chance for defending BaghdadIraqi President Saddam Hussein has counted on Iraq's elite Republican Guard to ensure his survival.
The Iraqi troops armed with decaying T-72 and T-62 Russian tanks were overpowered by far more modern American armor.
It's uncertain how strong a defense the Republican Guard will put up - it gets the best Iraq has, but it's believed to be the best of very little.
GlobalSecurity.org, a U.S.-based think-tank that compiles data on military forces, estimates the strength of the Republican Guard at about 50,000.
Republican Guard divisions led the invasion of Kuwait, but were replaced by regular army units in the neighboring country before the U.S.-led war to oust the invaders.
