F-14 SAR - April 2, 2003The following was received from a PJ in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Moffit said the F-14 crash was the result of a mechanical failure, not enemy fire.
Driscoll said the last crash of a plane in the air wing was at least five years ago.
While it is primarily a strike plane, its two-person crew gives it extra communications and target-locating capability compared to the newer F/A-18 Hornets.
"We have a tendency to lose more aircraft to mechanical and normal operating events than we do to combat," Moffit noted.
