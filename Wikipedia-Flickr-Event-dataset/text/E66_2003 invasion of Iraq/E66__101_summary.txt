The United States Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, slapped down the reporters who insisted that President George Bush had not followed the "war plan" they had all written about for weeks.
"I don't believe you have the war plan," Rumsfeld chided them at his first briefing since the attacks on Baghdad, "a fact that does not make me unhappy."
