Sixty-nine percent in a Washington Post poll published Saturday said they believe it is likely the Iraqi leader was personally involved in the attacks carried out by al-Qaeda.
A majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents believe it's likely Saddam was involved.

The president frequently has called the Iraq war an important centerpiece in the United States' war on terror.
But some members of the administration have said recently they don't believe there is a direct link.
