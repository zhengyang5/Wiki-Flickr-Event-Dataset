Published reports of the current troop strength of Iraqi ground forces are uncertain, though the total Iraqi ground forces were estimated to include 350,000 to 425,000 active-duty troops.
Iraqi divisions in the regular Army generally had 8,000-10,000 troops, with about half of the Army serving in non-divisional units.
The gap between theoretical and actual strength may have contributed to over-estimates of the strength of Iraqi forces deployed during the 1990-91 Gulf War.
Armored and mechanized divisions were triangular in organization; armored divisions had two armored brigades and a mechanized brigade, while mechanized divisions had two mechanized brigades and an armored brigade.
Iraqi divisions had at least four artillery battalions, but often were augmented by additional battalions.
