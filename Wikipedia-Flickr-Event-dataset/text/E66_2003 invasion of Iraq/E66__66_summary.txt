Russert: Senator John McCain, Senator Joe Biden, what should we do in Iraq?
It does us incredible damage, but I don't think it's comparable to Saddam's torture chambers by any stretch of the imagination.
Russert: Senator McCain, there is a debate within your Republican Party as to how to deal with this particular issue.
But I think John Kerry has an obligation to do that for the way he wants to heal.
McNamara: I don't think any of us predicted seven years ago or 15 years ago the deployment of 500,000 men to Vietnam.
