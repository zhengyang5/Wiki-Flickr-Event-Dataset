How much, if any, is left of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and related proscribed items and programmes?
Another matter - and one of great significance - is that many proscribed weapons and items are not accounted for.
We are fully aware that many governmental intelligence organizations are convinced and assert that proscribed weapons, items and programmes continue to exist.
The two commissions could be useful tools to come up with proscribed items to be destroyed and with new documentary evidence.
This was a declared site, and it was certainly one of the sites Iraq would have expected us to inspect.
