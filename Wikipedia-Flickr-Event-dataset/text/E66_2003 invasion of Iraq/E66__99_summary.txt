The mystery of what happened to Saddam Hussein begins at a palace compound called Dora Farms on the southern outskirts of Baghdad.
CBS News became the first news organization to visit Dora Farms.
No one has searched Dora Farms more carefully than Tim Madere, a U.S. Army colonel assigned the task of searching sensitive sites.
The compound has been searched three times â€“ once by the CIA and twice by Madere, trying to find Saddam's DNA.
This doesn't solve the mystery of what happened to Saddam, but the clues at Dora Farms leave no doubt he could have survived.
