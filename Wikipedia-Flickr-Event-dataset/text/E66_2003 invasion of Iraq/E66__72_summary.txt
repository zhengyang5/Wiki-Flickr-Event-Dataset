The result is that at a time of renewed interest in humanitarian intervention, the Iraq war and the effort to justify it even in part in humanitarian terms risk giving humanitarian intervention a bad name.
The Standards for Humanitarian InterventionUnusual among human rights groups, Human Rights Watch has a longstanding policy on humanitarian intervention.
Humanitarian PurposeAny humanitarian intervention should be conducted with the aim of maximizing humanitarian results.
Compliance with Humanitarian LawEvery effort should be made to ensure that a humanitarian intervention is carried out in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law.
The Iraq war highlights the need for a better understanding of when military intervention can be justified in humanitarian terms.
