All Council members explained their position following the vote, with many referring to the consensus adoption as a milestone for both Iraq and the Security Council.
The text indicated a timetable for the establishment of a democratically elected government and an end to the presence of the multinational force.
The text would also further strengthen the authority and rule of the Security Council.
We ask the Security Council to help us by acting now to adopt a Security Council resolution giving us necessary support.
A further objective will be to train and equip Iraqi security forces that will increasingly take responsibility for maintaining Iraqâ€™s security.
