A British soldier killed by insurgents in Iraq was still alive as he lay surrounded by a crowd almost four hours after his convoy was ambushed, an inquest was told yesterday.
They could hear Sgt Cullingworth calling two to three minutes after the ambush started, saying: "Clarkie, come back and get me."
Dr Nicholas Hunt said the footage showed that Sapper Allsopp was still breathing "although apparently close to death" in Al Zubayr.
Staff Sgt Cullingworth, from Essex, who had previously served in the Balkans and Afghanistan, left a wife and two boys, aged eight and three.
Sapper Allsopp, from north London, had previously served with bomb disposal in Cyprus and Kenya.
