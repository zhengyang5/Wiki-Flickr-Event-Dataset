The leaders discussed the prospects for a second resolution, but Mr Bush said: "The US would put its full weight behind efforts to get another resolution and would 'twist arms' and 'even threaten'.
Mr Blair replied that he was "solidly with the President and ready to do whatever it took to disarm Saddam."
But he also insisted that " a second Security Council resolution would provide an insurance policy against the unexpected, and international cover, including with the Arabs" .
President Bush said that he "thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups".
