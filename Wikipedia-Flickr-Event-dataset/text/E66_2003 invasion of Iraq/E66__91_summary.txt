Labour claims its actions are lawful while it bombs Iraq, strarves its people and sells arms to corrupt states7 August 2000"All governments are liars," wrote the great American muckraker I F Stone, "and nothing they say should be believed."
However, as the Prime Minister noted in his famous leaked memo, new Labour will "stand up" for Britain.
On the BBC's Today programme recently, the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain gave his personal assurance that new Labour had never sold arms to any government that used them for internal repression.
Apart from an occasional Amnesty report, the Foreign Office has largely succeeded in keeping the facts about the Saudi regime out of the British media.
"Our actions are entirely lawful," wrote Hain in a now notorious letter drafted by the Iraq desk at the Foreign Office.
