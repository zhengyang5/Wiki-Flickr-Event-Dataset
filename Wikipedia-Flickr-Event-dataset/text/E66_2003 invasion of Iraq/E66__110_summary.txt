Over the course of two weeks, the 1st BCT demonstrated the soundness of our Army Doctrine and the agility of the American Soldier.
The BCT synchronized conventional, special operations, and Iraqi forces to gain a foothold, clear the city, and initiate civil military operations.
Following a 40hr Ground Assault Convoy, 1st BCT attacked the southern and western sides of the city.
Again, the discipline and judgment of the American soldier was displayed as combat operations continued in the city.
It was calculated that by liberating An Najaf, the Shiites would rise up and assist the Coalition in the battle.
