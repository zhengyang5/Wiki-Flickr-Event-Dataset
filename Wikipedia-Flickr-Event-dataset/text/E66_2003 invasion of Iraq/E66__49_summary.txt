For Immediate ReleaseOffice of the Press SecretaryMarch 6, 2003President George Bush Discusses Iraq in National Press ConferenceThe East Room8:02 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Good evening.
Anything they choose will be better than the misery and torture and murder they have known under Saddam Hussein.
It's in our national interest, as well, that we deal with Saddam Hussein.
It makes no sense to allow this issue to continue on and on, in the hopes that Saddam Hussein disarms.
So whatever is resolved is going to have some finality to it, so that Saddam Hussein will take us seriously.
