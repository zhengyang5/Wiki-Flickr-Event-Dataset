Status changed for soldier killed in IraqInvestigation shows POW was murderedFrom Mike MountCNN Washington BureauWASHINGTON (CNN) -- A soldier thought to have been killed in combat in the opening days of Operation Iraqi Freedom was instead murdered by his Iraqi captors, according to a military investigation.
Walters' status was changed by the military earlier this month from Killed in Action to POW - Murdered.
His family was notified of the change this week, military officials said.
Military officials could not say if any other investigations from the war had changed the status of a service member's death.
With the change of status, Walters' family receives additional benefits from the military.
