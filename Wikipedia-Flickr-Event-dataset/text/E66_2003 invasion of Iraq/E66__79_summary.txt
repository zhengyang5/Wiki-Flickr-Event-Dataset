Investigation into the Netherlands' support for 2003 war finds military action was not justified under UN resolutionsThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a violation of international law, an independent inquiry in the Netherlands has found.
In a damning series of findings on the decision of the Dutch government to support Tony Blair and George Bush in the strategy of regime change in Iraq, the inquiry found the action had "no basis in international law".
"The Dutch government lent its political support to a war whose purpose was not consistent with Dutch government policy.
It found that when the Dutch government decided in August 2002 to support the attack on Iraq it treated intelligence about WMD and the legality of an invasion as "subservient".
The Dutch intelligence agencies were "more reserved" in their assessments than the government when discussing the initiative in parliament, the report found.
