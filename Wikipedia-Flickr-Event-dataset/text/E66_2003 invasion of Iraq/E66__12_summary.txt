U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait'Ready to conduct an operation'CAMP DOHA, Kuwait (CNN) -- The commander of coalition forces in Kuwait said Tuesday more than 100,000 U.S. troops are in the country ready to launch an attack if one is ordered against Iraq.
Another option under consideration would be for U.S. troops to seize control of an airfield in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.
Or, the airfield could be used for airborne troops to parachute in, or air assault troops to come in by helicopter.
Administration officials confirmed to CNN that in the past several days a small amount of additional U.S. troops have crossed the border into northern Iraq.
Kuwait raises alert levelWith preparations continuing for the potential war with Iraq, the Kuwaiti government raised its military alert level Tuesday.
