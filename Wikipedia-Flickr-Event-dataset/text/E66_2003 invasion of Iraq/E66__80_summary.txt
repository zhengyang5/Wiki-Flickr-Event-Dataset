Bush: Join 'coalition of willing'PRAGUE, Czech Republic (CNN) -- George W. Bush has said the United States will lead a "coalition of the willing" if the Iraqi president chooses not to give up his weapons of mass destruction.
"It's very important for our [NATO] nations as well as all free nations to work collectively to see to it that Saddam Hussein disarms," Bush said.
Bush said that friends of the U.S. could choose whether they wanted to participate in any military action against Iraq should Saddam refuse to surrender his weapons programmes.
Bush met Havel and Czech Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla in the splendour of Prague Castle and Hrzansky Palace.
Bush said the U.S. could draw on such "effective military capacity" in a changing NATO.
