Mr. President,Mr. Secretary-General,MinistersAmbassadors,I would like to thank Mr. Blix and Mr. ElBaradei for the information they have just given us on the continuing inspections in Iraq.
Or do we consider that the possibilities regarding inspections presented in resolution 1441 have still not been fully explored?
So what have we just learned from the report by Mr. Blix and Mr. ElBaradei?
-They must support the efforts of Mr. Blix and Mr. ElBaradei:The latter are naturally the best placed to tell us which ones they wish to adopt for the maximum effectiveness of their work.
France has already announced that it had additional resources available to Mr. Blix and Mr. ElBaradei, beginning with its Mirage IV reconnaissance aircraft.
