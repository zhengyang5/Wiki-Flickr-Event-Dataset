An Army unit removed 250 tons of ammunition from the Al-Qaqaa weapons depot in April 2003 and later destroyed it, the company’s former commander said Friday.
A Defense Department spokesman said some of it was of the same type as the missing explosives that have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
But those 250 tons were not located under the seal of the International Atomic Energy Agency — as the missing high-grade explosives had been.
Still, 377 tons of explosives amounts to a tiny fraction of the weaponry in Iraq.
U.S. forces have already destroyed, or have scheduled to be destroyed, more than 400,000 tons of all manner of Iraqi weapons and ammunition.
