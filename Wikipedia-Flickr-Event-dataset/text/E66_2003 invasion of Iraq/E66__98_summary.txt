In fact, it was Mr. Hussein, according to the secretary's account.
The United States bombed military command sites in the capital, but Mr. Hussein stayed in civilian neighborhoods.
But after his convoy encountered American armored vehicles, Mr. Hussein and his aides were frantic, and forced their way into a Baghdad residence.
Alarmed, Mr. Hussein, his sons and Mr. Mahmud got in their cars and drove toward Hit, spending the night in palm grove outside town.
The brothers went back to Iraq, eventually reaching Tikrit and Mosul, where American troops killed them in July 2003.
