IRAQIS BASH CHOPPERS One U.S. copter downed, crew captured by Saddam's guardsA formidable fleet of U.S. Apache Longbow assault helicopters was transformed from hunters to prey yesterday by a savage barrage of anti-aircraft fire.
One of the choppers was downed by the withering groundfire and its crew captured by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard.
Iraqi television broadcast pictures of the captive pilots and their downed Apache AH-64D helicopter sitting intact on a grassy field as men with Kalashnikov rifles danced around it.
The downed chopper is from the 1st Battalion of the 227th Aviation Regiment, based in Fort Hood, Tex., the Army said.
Iraq also claimed a second helicopter was shot down, which an embedded correspondent with The New York Times also reported.
