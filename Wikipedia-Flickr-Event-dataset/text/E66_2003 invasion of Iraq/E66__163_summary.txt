Robin Cook, the leader of the Commons and a former foreign secretary, today resigned from the government in protest over the prime minister's stance on Iraq.
Following a weekend of fervent speculation - and silence from Mr Cook himself - the minister left Downing Street before the start of today's emergency cabinet.
Mr Cook said in a statement: "It is 20 years ago that I first joined Labour's shadow cabinet.
Mr Cook is now expected to make a public statement on his resignation in the Commons tonight, following Jack Straw's address to MPs at 7pm.
Downing Street later announced it would publish in full the letters of correspondence between the prime minister and Mr Cook.
