No-fly zones: The legal positionThe two no-fly zones over Iraq were imposed by the US, Britain and France after the Gulf War, in what was described as a humanitarian effort to protect Shi'a Muslims in the south and Kurds in the north.
However, unlike the military campaign to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the no-fly zones were not authorised by the UN and they are not specifically sanctioned by any Security Council resolution.
But critics of the no-fly zones point out that the resolution did not say the Security Council was acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which provides for enforcement action.
International law Many UK ministers say that under international law, there is a right to intervene to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.
"We have believed for a long time that there is no basis in international law for this type of bombing," Mr Vedrine has said.
