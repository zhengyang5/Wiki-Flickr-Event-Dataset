But within minutes, Mr. Hage said, Mr. Obeidi collapsed, and a doctor was called to treat him.
Mr. Obeidi told Mr. Hage that Iraq would make deals to avoid war, including helping in the Mideast peace process.
Mr. Hage said Mr. Obeidi made it clear that he wanted to get his message to Washington, so Mr. Hage contacted Mr. Maloof in Washington.
Mr. Hage said Mr. Habbush asked him if it was true that he knew Mr. Perle.
Mr. Hage said Mr. Habbush offered to turn him over to Mr. Hage, but Mr. Hage said he would pass on the message that Mr. Yasin was available.
