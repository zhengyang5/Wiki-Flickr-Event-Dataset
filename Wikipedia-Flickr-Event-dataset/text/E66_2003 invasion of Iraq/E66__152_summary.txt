Mr Ted Turner, founder of the Cable News Network (CNN), said that Mr Murdoch helped start the American-led war by using his News Corp media outlets, such as Fox TV, to advocate an invasion.
In a speech in San Francisco on Thursday night, Mr Turner said Mr Murdoch promoted the war because 'it's good for his newspapers and good for his television stations'.
Mr Turner is stepping down next month from his position as vice-chairman of AOL Time Warner, the world's largest media company.
Mr Turner likened Mr Murdoch to William Randolph Hearst, publisher of newspapers which included the San Francisco Examiner in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
'Hearst used to like to boast that he started the Spanish-American War with his newspapers,' Mr Turner said.
