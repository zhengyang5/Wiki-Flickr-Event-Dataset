UC Berkeley Web FeatureReporters, commentators visit Berkeley to conduct in-depth postmortem of Iraq war coverageâ€“ The U.S. invasion of Iraq was without a doubt the most widely and closely reported war in military history.

"We thought it was really important to conduct a postmortem on how the media did," says Orville Schell, Dean of the Journalism School.
