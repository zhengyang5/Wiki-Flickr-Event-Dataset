Project on Defense Alternatives Research Monograph # 8

20 October 2003 Appendix 1. Survey and assessment of reported

Iraqi combatant fatalities in the 2003 War

This appendix compiles reports of Iraqi combatant fatalities made by US defense officials, Central Command staff, field commanders, other military personnel, and journalists traveling with coalition military units. The survey draws on approximately 200 press reports covering 69 individual battles and engagements of varying size and scope. Regarding these combat events, the press articles convey 140 discrete numerical estimates and another 30 that are composite (that is, covering more than one event).Forty of the articles reviewed for this analysis do not contain numerical estimates, but convey important substantiating detail.

For most of the combat events there are multiple or overlapping estimates. When simply added together, the higher-end estimates suggest an observed Iraqi combatant fatality total exceeding 14,000. But these reports cannot be taken at face value; they often convey hasty or impressionistic counts made under great stress. In some case, when the estimates emanate from higher command or political authorities, they may reflect an information warfare objective more than they do facts on the ground. Inflating combatant casualty estimates can be one way to convince an adversary to quit the fight. This may have been the case with the Central Command estimate of 2,000-3,000 Iraqis killed in the 5 April armored thrust into Baghdad, as Lexington Institute analyst Dan Goure has suggested.(1)

Rejecting the 14,000 figure, our review of estimates made by field observers concludes that a reliable count is in the range of 4,895 to 6,370 observed and reported Iraqi combatant fatalities for the period 19 March through 20 April 2003.

In calculating this sum we have controlled for casualty inflation in several ways:

First, we gave greatest weight to observations of limited scope made at the company, battalion, and brigade level. Based on these, we built more comprehensive estimates -- that is, estimates of broader scope, covering larger swaths of territory and time.

Second, estimates by military or civil authorities above the division level (for instance, Central Command and Defense Department spokespersons)were excluded from our countexcept when they were consistent with estimates made by those closer to the actual battles and combat engagements. (In several instances, estimates of Iraqi fatalities made by authorities above the division level were found to exceed those made by field commanders by 100 percent to 200 percent.)

Third, estimates made by embedded journalists and by unit field commanders at the division level or below were also adjusted in many cases, especially when the estimates were expressed in rounded numbers and involved more than 20 fatalities. Larger, rounded estimates made by reporters and commanders were often meant to cover multiple engagements, multiple battalion-sized units, or several days or even weeks of activity. Our approach disfavored such sweeping estimates because they are inherently more difficult to substantiate. We also assumed that such estimates were more subject to inflation.

Fourth, we settled on estimates around which there was a convergence of evidence -- both testimony and substantiating detail. Our default assumption, based on several confirming instances, was that larger, rounded estimates could overstate observed fatalities by a factor ranging from 30 percent to 275 percent. We relaxed this assumption in accord with the amount of testimony, the proximity of the observers to the events, and the presence and extent of supporting narrative detail.

It is important to recognize, however, that our adjusted estimate of observed fatalities is, at best, a more reliable accounting of what was seen and reported -- not all there was to see and report. Coalition units did not travel everywhere, nor did military personnel and journalists see and report everything. Much of the killing occurred beyond visual range or was obscured by structures and terrain. Especially regarding long-range fires: much of the evidence of their fatal effects would have been buried or removed before ground personnel and journalists could observe them.

In one respect our survey was limited by choice: with few exceptions, we only included combat events in our pool if they were associated with a numerical estimate of combatant fatalities. Without doubt, many smaller engagements are not included in our count. Three important areas in which our coverage is notably incomplete are the northern front, the operations of US marine units in Baghdad, and special force operations. Our broader reading of press reports and CENTCOM press briefings gives us the impression that our sample could easily have missed 10 to 15 percent of all combat events weighted in accord with the number of fatalities they involved.

Thus, the following summary of observed combatant fatalities can be considered only one, limited input to the calculation of the war's death toll. The problem of incompleteness is further addressed in the main body of the report.

Our estimate for total observed and reported Iraqi combatant fatalities for the period 20 March through 20 April is 4,895 - 6,370. Sub-estimatesfor city areas are presented below in Table A1. The evidence for each areais briefly reviewed in the sections that follow.

1700-2120

If accepted uncritically, official coalition estimates of Iraqi combatant fatalities in the battle for Baghdad suggest a death toll of in excess of 7,000 soldiers and militia. However, the larger, more sweeping estimates on which this high total depends originate mostly with upper-level commanders, not field commanders or journalists. For our estimate, we exclude numbers originating from Central Command and instead depend for the most part on estimates issued by commanders on the brigade level and below. One area of incompleteness regards Marine Corps operations in Baghdad, which seem under-reported.

1.1. Combat on the immediate approach to Baghdad: 70-90 Iraqi combatant fatalities (PDA estimate).



As they approached Baghdad on April 3, units of the "3rd Infantry fought Republican Guard and Iraqi army forces, destroying at least seven Iraqi armored personnel carriers and 15 tanks."

Reuters correspondent Nadim Ladki said there were more than 120 people wounded in the attack on the village, which lies between the airport and the Iraqi capital. "We saw a pile of dead bodies at one of the four hospitals where the victims were taken. Most of them appeared to be military."

1.2 Baghdad airport engagements: 400 to 450 Iraqi combatant deaths (PDA corrected estimate). By some official estimates, more than 2,500 Iraqis were killed in the effort to seize and defend the international airport. However, disaggregated estimates by lower level commanders and embedded reporters suggest the number of Iraqis killed was less than 500. For our estimate we accept 400 to 450 Iraqi combatant fatalities.

Led by five tanks, mixed Iraqi forces attempt a counter-attack on US positions at international airport on April 4; 40 Iraqis are killed. Prior to this, coalition damage assessment set airport death toll at 320 dismounted Iraqi personnel as well as 31 air defense guns, three troop carriers, 23 trucks, one field artillery piece, and an ammunition truck were seized or destroyed. "Iraqi tanks 'suicidal' airport charge," Sydney Morning Herald (AP), 4 April 2003. "Military sources" report at least 320 Iraqis killed in battle to take Baghdad airport.

"Having moved on to the runway on Thursday evening, the 3rd Infantry came under shellfire.... From the skies, A-10 Thunderbolt 'Tankbusters' fired on Iraqi tanks, reducing many of them to burning wrecks. Other warplanes bombarded airport buildings. Reporters from the New York Times saw three satellite- guided bombs strike barracks and hangars on the airport's northern side. From Iraqi positions on the ground, anti-aircraft fire shot up into the darkness. By morning yesterday, the worst of the battle was over. It was not entirely clear what toll it had taken but the 3rd Infantry said it had killed between 300 and 400 Iraqi troops."

1.3. "Thunder Run" armored foray into Baghdad, April 5: 600 to 800 Iraqi combatant deaths (PDA corrected estimate). By Central Command's estimate as many as 3,000 Iraqi combatants were killed during the first armored foray into Baghdad, which covered 25 miles in three hours. However, a field commander who led the operation estimates the number of fatalities as more than 1,000. As a hedge against exaggeration we accept for our estimate only 600 to 800 Iraqi combatant fatalities.

Central Command estimates that 2,000 to 3,000 Iraqi troops were killed during US armored foray into Baghdad. "2,000 to 3,000 Iraqi Troops Killed in Foray," Associated Press, 6 April 2003. (Disregarded by PDA estimate.)

Colonel David Perkins, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the US 3rd Infantry, said: "There was some very intense fighting, with just about every kind of weapons system you can imagine. It was a non-stop gauntlet of both heavy systems as well as light infantry on roofs, shooting down on top of tanks with RPGs rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns....We have destroyed probably in excess of 1,000 dismounted infantry."

"On Friday, his unit, part of the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division, swept through neighborhoods outside Baghdad where civilians were blowing kisses. A day later, as his unit pressed closer to the city, the civilians were fleeing in terror. Sunday said his unit was moving today through an area with homes, warehouses and highways. 'You know Washington,the Beltway? Not that big, but there was stuff like that,' he said. Soon, firefights erupted. Sunday said he saw Iraqi soldiers firing from roofs,from bridge underpasses, from trucks. The boom of artillery fire and grenades filled the air. Amid the flying bullets, he was astonished to see a woman simply sitting in the middle of the road, cradling a little boy.

On Wednesday April 9 US forces consolidate hold on Baghdad, seizing the headquarters of the Special Republican Guard (1-64 Armor Battalion), targeting scattered militia positions with mortar and artillery fire, and attacking a Mosque from which militia fire emanated. Bridgeheads over the Tigris were also expanded (4-64 Armor Battalion) to link up with USMC units. One of the three lead battalions, "the 3rd Battalion, 15th Regiment, which held several positions in central Baghdad...killed 15 to 20 fighters, mostly rocket-propelled grenade teams in groups of two or three, said Maj.

425-555 Iraqi combatant fatalities.

Publically available estimates of Iraqi combatant fatalities in the Basra area and to its south suggest a death toll exceeding 650. And these estimates provide only partial coverage of combat in the area. For our estimate we accept 425 to 535 observed fatalities. This aggregated estimate significantly discounts some of the larger estimates made by military officials and embedded journalists, noted below.

Apache Troop commander Capt. H. Clay Lyle had moved his tanks and Bradleys towards a position that the Air Force said the Iraqis were occupying on the north side of a freeway. After jets and artillery had worked over the position... the Cav opened fire with their Abrams 120mm main guns... From less than half a mile away, the fight appeared to be almost completely one-sided. The yellow flashes of Lyle's tanks firing were quickly followed by orange fireballs as the high explosive rounds hit home.... The troop also had fought a running battle with light infantry militia and suicide bombers through the night and into Friday morning. The cav soldiers shot and killed the drivers of several vehicles that approached them at high speed and refused to stop. ... Three suspected suicide bus missions were attempted against Apache Troop last night.

11. Northern Front

(including Kirkuk, Mosul, Tikrit):

230-375 Iraqi combatant fatalities.

A distinct problem in formulating an estimate of combatant fatalities in northern Iraq is the incompleteness of reporting on combat there. There are a variety of reasons for this incompleteness: many of the northern engagements were smaller in scale; the combat was dispersed and irregular in character; it depended uniquely on special forces; the theater was relatively inaccessible and there was a prevailing sense that its importance was secondary. We calculate that between 230 and 375 Iraqi combatants were observed killed in the incomplete sample of engagements that we cite below. (A raw or uncorrected survey of the associated testimony would suggest approximately 450 fatalities.)

11.1. Combined arms assault on Ansar: "American commanders at the battlefield today estimated that 30 to 50 Ansar militants had been killed and that 2 had been captured. The Special Forces commander said 30 to 40 Ansar fighters died in Sarget. Kosrat Rosul Ali, a veteran Kurdish guerrilla and politician, said about 100 Ansar fighters had died throughout the day." C.
