Civilians fired on in Basra: UKUpdatedBritish military officials claim Iraqi forces have opened fire on civilians trying to flee the southern city of Basra in their thousands.
The scale of the shooting by the Iraqi forces loyal to President Saddam Hussein, who have been surrounded by US and British troops, is also unclear.
Another British spokeswoman, Flight Lieutenant Emma Thomas, put the number of civilians tryingto flee at "two to three thousand."
British forces claim to have surrounded the city but have continued to meet resistance from Iraqi militia.
The Black Watch destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks which had tried to break out of the cordon surrounding Basra yesterday.
