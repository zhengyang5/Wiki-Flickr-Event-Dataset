Pilger uncovered video footage of Powell in Cairo on February 24, 2001 saying, "He (Saddam Hussein) has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction.
Powell boasted this was because America's policy of containment and its sanctions had effectively disarmed Saddam.
Pilger interviewed several leading US government figures in Washington but said he did not ask Powell or Rice to respond to his claims.
In his report, Pilger interviews Ray McGovern, a former senior CIA officer and friend of Bush's father and ex-president, George Bush senior.
McGovern told Pilger that going to war because of weapons of mass destruction "was 95 per cent charade."
