The Seattle Times March 27, 2003Most loyal soldiers in Iraq belong to Fedayeen SaddamBy Seattle Times news servicesWASHINGTON Until the war began, few Americans had heard of the Fedayeen Saddam, the paramilitary extremists loyal to Saddam Hussein who have led much of Iraq's defenses in the first week of the war.
Coalition forces say Fedayeen have engaged in fake surrender ambushes and have shot civilians or regular-army soldiers who wanted to leave Basra or surrender.
The paramilitary organization is loyal to the Baath party, which took control in Iraq in 1968, and has evolved into the totalitarian political tool of Saddam, experts said.
Founded in 1995 by Saddam's elder son Odai, who commands the Fedayeen, recruited from regions loyal to Saddam.
Size: 18,000-20,000 fighters out of Iraqi paramilitary forces of 42,000-44,000, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
