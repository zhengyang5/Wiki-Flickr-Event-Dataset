The lightly armed force is prepared to perform a variety of missions, from delivering humanitarian aid to hunting down supporters of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, INC spokesmen said.
Some of the force will be deployed to other southern cities, the official said, while another group will assist U.S. forces in northern Iraq.
The INC is one of six anti-Hussein organizations -- including groups representing northern Iraqi Kurds and southern Iraqi Shiites -- that have formed an uneasy coalition under U.S. auspices.
The airlift began Friday with U.S. military aircraft ferrying Chalabi and the INC soldiers from northern Iraq to Tallil airfield in southern Iraq.
An INC news release on the deployment said the contingent has been designated the 1st Battalion of Free Iraqi Forces.
