Lynch book tells of rape by captors By Rick Hampson, USA TODAY PALESTINE, W.Va.  Jessica Lynch, the former prisoner of war whose rescue made her the most famous GI in the Iraq war, was raped by her captors, according to her authorized biography. Rick Bragg's book also casts doubts on the claim of an Iraqi lawyer who says he helped rescue the soldier. Glamour Magazine handout But the book, which will be released Tuesday, says Lynch has no memory of being sexually assaulted, and she appreciates her treatment in an Iraqi hospital after her vehicle crashed during an Iraqi ambush. In the book, author Rick Bragg writes that scars on Lynch's body and medical records indicate she was sodomized, but that Lynch recalls nothing: "Jessi lost three hours. She lost them in the snapping bones, in the crash of the Humvee, in the torment her enemies inflicted on her after she was pulled from it." RELATED ITEM Excerpts released Thursday of an interview with former prisoner of war Jessica Lynch by ABC News' Diane Sawyer, to be broadcast Tuesday night on Primetime:  On whether she's a hero: "I don't look at myself as a hero. My heroes are Lori (Pvt. Lori Piestewa, who was killed during the ambush on Lynch's convoy), the soldiers that are over there, the soldiers that were in that car beside me, the ones that came and rescued me. I'm just a survivor."



 On written accounts of her heroism: "It hurt in a way that people would make up stories that they had no truth about. Only I would have been able to know that, because the other four people in my vehicle aren't here to tell that story. So I would have been the only one â€” able to say, yeah, I went down shooting. But I didn't. I did not."  On the wrong turns that led to the ambush: "We weren't thinking quickly. We were so tired, we were hungry. It was just a mistake."



 On whether she fired her rifle in the ambush: "No. My weapon did jam, and I did not shoot, not a round, nothing."  On why she is discussing not firing her weapon: "I'm ashamed, I'm scared, I was nervous, I was â€” I mean, every word that you can think of, that's the way I was feeling. But yet I was proud. I was proud to be there, I was proud to serve with every one of those in that vehicle. I was proud to know them. Everyone in that vehicle was a fighter. I knew that they were there in my vehicle fighting, for me, because I had no ammunition, I have a weapon that was jammed."  On whether she killed any Iraqis: "No. No. I went down praying to my knees. And that's the last I remember."



 On her captivity in the Iraqi hospital: "I kept repeating, 'Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me.' They kept telling me, 'Oh, it's OK,' you know, 'We're not going to hurt you.' If you were surrounded by a whole hospital of Iraqis, would you believe them?"  On her emotions while being held captive: "I was afraid to actually let it all out, like emotionally just, you know, cry. Because I was afraid, OK, if I do that, they're going to see that I am so weak, that I'm so terrified of them that, you know, they're going to win. I mean, that's what they want is to break me down to see that I am so weak and useless."  On how she was treated: "From the time I woke up in that hospital, no one beat me, no one slapped me, no one, nothing. I mean, I actually had one nurse, that she would sing to me."  On her Iraqi caregivers: "I'm so thankful that they helped me in any way that they could. I'm so thankful for those people, because that's why I'm alive today."  On whether she was bothered about how her rescue was portrayed by the military: "It does that they used me as a way to symbolize all this stuff. Yeah, it's wrong. I don't know why they filmed it, or why they say the things they, you know. All I know was that I was in that hospital hurting. I needed help. I wanted out of there. It didn't matter to me if they would have came in shirts and blank guns, it wouldn't have mattered to me, I wanted out of there."  On why she wrote the book and whether it was for money: "No. No, no. Not about the money at all. It's just I want my story to be told. I mean, I wrote it just to let everyone know my side of the story, the soldiers who are beside me in that war and the soldiers that are still over there."

He adds, "The records do not tell whether her captors assaulted her almost lifeless, broken body after she was lifted from the wreckage, or if they assaulted her and then broke her bones into splinters until she was almost dead." Lynch told ABC News' Primetime in an interview to be broadcast Tuesday night, that although she doesn't remember being assaulted, "even just the thinking about that, that's too painful." Wrong place, wrong time The book —I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story— will be issued by publisher Alfred A. Knopf on Veterans Day. The New York Daily News and The Herald-Dispatch of Huntington, W.Va., obtained copies of the book and published sections Thursday. Their general accuracy was confirmed by Lynch family representatives in her home state of West Virginia. Lynch, now 20, was shipped to Kuwait in January with the Army's 507th Maintenance Company and was captured March 23 after her convoy was ambushed in Nasiriyah. She was rescued from an Iraqi hospital April 1 by U.S. forces. The episode was originally described in heroic terms, with Lynch battling fiercely and later being rescued under dire circumstances. But subsequently it was learned that Lynch never fired a shot because her rifle jammed. By the time U.S. forces arrived, the hospital was undefended. And Iraqi hospital staffers had earlier tried to sneak her to safety in an ambulance, but turned back when suspicious U.S. soldiers opened fire. In the book, Lynch admits she was no hero: "I didn't kill nobody." In the broadcast interview, ABC's Diane Sawyer asked her, "Did you go down, like somebody said, (like) Rambo?" Lynch replied, "No. No. I went down praying to my knees. And that's the last I remember. "I did nothing," she added. "I mean, I was just there in that spot, you know — the wrong place, the wrong time." Lynch also challenges the account of an Iraqi lawyer who says he saw her being slapped by military interrogators in the hospital. "From the time I woke up in that hospital, no one beat me, no one slapped me... I mean, I actually had one nurse, that she would sing to me," she told ABC. "I'm so thankful for those people, because that's why I'm alive today." In the book, Lynch describes how Iraqi doctors were branded "traitors" by those loyal to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for helping her. The book describes Lynch's injuries in detail for the first time: • Her right arm was shattered between her shoulder and her elbow, and the compound fracture "shoved slivers of bone through muscles, nerves and skin." • Her spine was fractured in two places. • Her right foot was crushed. • Her left leg was broken into pieces above and below the knee, "and splintered bone had made a mess of nerves and left her without feeling in that limb." • The flesh along the hairline of her forehead was torn in a ragged, 4-inch line. Asked by Sawyer to describe her first physical sensation upon regaining consciousness, Lynch said, "I've never felt that much pain in my whole entire life. It was, you know, from my foot to my other foot to my legs to my arms to my back, my head...I knew that if I felt that pain, then at least my legs, arms, you know, head, back, everything was still attached...But I seriously thought I was going to be paralyzed for the rest of my life." The ordeal left Lynch barely able to walk, unable to use her right hand or control her bowels. Now, she says, she still has no feeling in her left foot below the ankle and no idea when it will come back. And attempts to electronically stimulate her malfunctioning bowels and kidneys failed. As for walking, "I just want to keep adding, you know, just steps every day, so eventually I can throw away the crutches and, you know, just start walking on my own," she told ABC. "That's my goal. I just want to be able to walk again." Survivor stories Lynch seems troubled by her lionization as a hero. "I'm just a survivor," she says in the book. "When I think about it, it keeps me awake at night." Lynch's treatment while in captivity had been a subject of speculation in her hometown of Palestine, W.Va. "Everybody suspected under the circumstances something like that could happen," LouAnn Thorn of Palestine said Thursday, referring to the rape report. "But since we hadn't heard anything about it until she got home, I thought just maybe it didn't happen." The book's release coincides with NBC's airing Sunday night of the movie Saving Jessica Lynch. It's based mostly on a book by Iraqi lawyer Mohammed al-Rehaief, who says he helped Lynch while she was in the hospital. Lynch, however, says she has no memory of al-Rehaief. She did not cooperate in the making of the movie. Lynch and Bragg will split a $1 million advance for the book, which will have a first printing of about 500,000 copies. Bragg has written several books and won the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing in 1996 while at The New York Times. He resigned in May after the newspaper suspended him over a story that carried his byline but was reported largely by a freelancer. Copyright 2005 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
