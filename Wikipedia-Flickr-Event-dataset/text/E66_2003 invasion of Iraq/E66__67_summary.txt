The group, which received a copy of the 2002 memo among several hundred pages of other documents, provided a copy of the memo to The New York Times.
In early 2002, the Central Intelligence Agency sent the former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV to Niger to investigate possible attempts to sell uranium to Iraq.
The review concluded that Niger was "probably not planning to sell uranium to Iraq," in part because France controlled the uranium industry in the country and could block such a sale.
The State Department review also cast doubt on the logistics of Niger being able to deliver 500 tons of uranium even if the sale were attempted.
"All the people understood that there was documentary evidence" suggesting that the intelligence about the sale was faulty, he said.
