Its capability is very carefully monitored to assess the impact of any changes on coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones.
The coalition has on occasion responded purely in self-defence using high precision weapons against elements of the Iraqi Air Defence System.
Other important initiatives, including the UN-sponsored arms embargo on Iraq, also have an impact on the capability of Saddam's air defence infrastructure.
From time to time minor adjustments are made to the authorised self-defence responses to violations of the no-fly zones.
Detailed procedures governing the operations conducted by coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones are reviewed and amended from time to time.
