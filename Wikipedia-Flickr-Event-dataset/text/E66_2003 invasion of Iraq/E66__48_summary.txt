“The stated policy of the United States is regime change,” Bush said at the White House.
Bush also wants Hussein to let people who may have witnessed his alleged military buildup to leave Iraq to be interviewed without fear of reprisal.
He continues to assert that military force may ultimately be needed to disarm Hussein, but he has moved away from the threat of a unilateral US attack.
“I believe the free world, if we make up our mind to, can disarm this man peacefully,” Bush said.
Bush seeks a single resolution calling on Hussein to disarm and threatening the use of force should the Iraqi leader fail to comply.
