Two ships have commemorated the battle with the name USS Cowpens.
In those days, carriers were named for battles, so the ship was reclassified CVL-25, and named USS Cowpens.
The USS Cowpens, CVL-25, was decommissioned January 13, 1947 and reclassified as an aircraft transport, AVT-1, but she never served in that role.
Thus the USS Cowpens, CG-63 can fulfill her mission in all directions, up, down, and out.
The newest USS Cowpens expects to live up to her heritage and serve the United States of America to the best of her ability.
