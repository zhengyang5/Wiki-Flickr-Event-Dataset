Jessica Lynch and the death of NFL star-turned-soldier Pat Tillman.
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is scheduled to take up those cases in an April 24 hearing, the panel announced Tuesday.
The hearing will feature testimony from Lynch and relatives of Tillman, who was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004.
The Pentagon reported that she was shot and stabbed during a fierce firefight with Iraqi troops in which 11 of her comrades were killed.
Lynch later turned out to have suffered broken bones when her vehicle crashed during the battle; her weapon was jammed with sand and she never fired a shot.
