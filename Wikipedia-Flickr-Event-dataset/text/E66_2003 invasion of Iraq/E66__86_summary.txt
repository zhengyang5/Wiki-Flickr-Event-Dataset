Iraq’s armed forces are estimated at 389,000 (army 350,000, navy 2,000, air force 20,000 and air defence 17,000).
Iraqi air force sorties are likely to be one-way missions – or decoys aimed at luring allied aircraft into missile traps.
There is growing consensus among military experts that Iraq would avoid large-scale, battlefield engagements in favour of withdrawing to cities to engage Coalition forces in a war of attrition.
This would lead to great loss of life, both military and civilian.
Unlike active radar systems that transmit signals, making them vulnerable to attack by radar-seeking missiles, passive systems linked by optical fibres don’t transmit.
