My report to the Council today is an update on the status of the IAEA's nuclear verification activities in Iraq pursuant to Security Council resolution 1441 and other relevant resolutions.
Current Inspection Activities: Still Building CapacityThe focus of the IAEA's inspections has now moved from the "reconnaissance phase" into the "investigative phase".
In response to a request by the IAEA, Iraq has expanded the list of relevant Iraqi personnel to over 300, along with their current work locations.
The list includes the higher-level key scientists known to the IAEA in the nuclear and nuclear related areas.
We have to date found no evidence of ongoing prohibited nuclear or nuclear related activities in Iraq.
