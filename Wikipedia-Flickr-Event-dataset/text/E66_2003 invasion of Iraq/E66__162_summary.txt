Feith's office "was predisposed to finding a significant relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda," according to portions of the report, released yesterday by Sen. Carl M. Levin (D-Mich.).
The inspector general described Feith's activities as "an alternative intelligence assessment process."
"It was from the start a criticism of the consensus of the intelligence community, and in presenting it I was not endorsing its substance.
"The bottom line is that intelligence relating to the Iraq-al-Qaeda relationship was manipulated by high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense to support the administration's decision to invade Iraq," Levin said yesterday.
The summary document confirmed a range of accusations that Levin had leveled against Feith's office, alleging inaccurate work.
