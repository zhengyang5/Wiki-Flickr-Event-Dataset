US and British troops were locked in fierce gunfights with Republican Guard soldiers yesterday as they struggled to take control of Umm Qasr, a small strategically important port on the Kuwaiti border.
The port will be used to bring in food and logistics supplies once fighting is over.
At the dockyard by the port the marines spotted a lone gunman manning a sentry post above the main gates.
The marines then ran through the port buildings, marking each cleared room with a red cross on the wall.
At least 40 Iraqi soldiers were still holding out yesterday in the old part of the city.
