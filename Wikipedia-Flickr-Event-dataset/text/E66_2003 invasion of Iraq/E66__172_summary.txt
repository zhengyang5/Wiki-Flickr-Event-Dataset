Last Tuesday, the U.S. Air Force tested a new and very powerful weapon called the Massive Ordnance Air Blast.
It delivers about 10 times the blast of most U.S. Air Force and Navy bombs ("smart" or otherwise).
Eglin Air Force Base, which is in Florida, is home of the Air Armament Center.
A few years ago, the Air Force asked Eglin to come up with some ideas for the next-generation gunship.
According to the Air Force, Eglin received the order to put the concept into development last October.
