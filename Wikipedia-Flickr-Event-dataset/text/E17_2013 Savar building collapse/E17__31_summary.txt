SAVAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - A young Bangladeshi woman who spent 17 days buried alive under a collapsed garments factory was rescued on Friday when astonished workmen heard a voice calling “save me, save me” from the rubble.
When the eight-storey building collapsed on April 24, Begum was trapped in a lightless, cell-like nook - alone, but alive.
“To save water I used to drink only a small quantity,” Begum, 19, told Somoy television from her hospital bed.
It must have been a miracle.”A woman is rescued from the rubble of the Rana Plaza building 17 days after the building collapsed in Savar May 10, 2013.
“I heard a faint voice saying ‘Save me, Save me’,” Rana told Reuters television.
