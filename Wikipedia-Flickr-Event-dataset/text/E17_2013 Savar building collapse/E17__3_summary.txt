The collapse on April 24 of the Rana Plaza factory building focused worldwide attention on the hazardous conditions in Bangladesh's low-cost garment industry and strengthened pressure for reforms.
Primark is one of the few retailers that have acknowledged that their clothes were being made by factories in the Rana Plaza building at the time of the collapse.
Minimum wages for garment workers are among the lowest in the world at 3,000 takas ($38) a month.
Bulldozers and other vehicles have been removed from the building site, which will be fenced with bamboo sticks.
The Rana Plaza owner and eight other people, including garment factory owners, have been detained in the collapse investigation.
