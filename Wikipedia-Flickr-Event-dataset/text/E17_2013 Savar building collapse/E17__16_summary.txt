New Wave Style, a garment factory that occupied three floors of the building, said at least half the casualties were women.
Bangladesh's industrial police confirmed that they had ordered the evacuation of Rana Plaza, but thousands of people still reported for work yesterday.
Yesterday, all the upper floors of Rana Plaza collapsed, leaving only the ground floor intact.
New Wave Style, the largest of the factories, lists international retailers such as Benetton and Monsoon along with British high street names such as Primark, Matalan and Bonmarche among its main buyers.
The incident raises further questions over safety and working conditions in Bangladesh's £13bn (€15.2bn) garment industry, which supplies many high street brands.
