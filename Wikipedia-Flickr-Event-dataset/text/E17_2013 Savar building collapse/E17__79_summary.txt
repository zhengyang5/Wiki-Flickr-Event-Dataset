Sohel Rana received the maximum three-year sentence for failing to declare his personal wealth to Bangladesh's anti-graft commission.
He faces further charges, including murder, over the Rana Plaza disaster.
Rana and 37 others, including government officials, could receive the death penalty if they are found guilty of murder over the complex's collapse.
Survivors of the collapse said they had been ordered to enter the factory to work despite complaining about the appearance of cracks in the walls.
