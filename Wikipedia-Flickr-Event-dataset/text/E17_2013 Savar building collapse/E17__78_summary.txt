Authorities in Bangladesh will press murder charges against the owners of the Rana Plaza garment-factory complex in Dhaka that collapsed in 2013, killing more than 1,100 people in the country’s worst-ever industrial disaster, AFP reports.
“We are going to press murder charges against 41 people including the owners of the building, Sohel Rana and his parents, later today,” Bijoy Krishna Kar, the lead investigator for the Bangladeshi police, told the news agency.
More than 2,400 workers were rescued or escaped alive after the factory collapsed on April 24, 2013.
“They [Sohel Rana and the factory owners] discussed and decided to keep the factory open,” Kar said.
Rana and the others will also be charged with violating Bangladesh’s building code.
