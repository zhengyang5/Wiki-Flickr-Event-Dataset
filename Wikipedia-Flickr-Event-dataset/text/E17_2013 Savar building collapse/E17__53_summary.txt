DHAKA - Bangladesh has shut down 18 garment plants for safety reasons after a building housing five garment factories collapsed last month and killed more than 800 people, a minister said Wednesday.
The move comes days after Bangladesh agreed with the International Labour Organisation to give safety "the highest consideration" amid government fears Western garment firms might source goods elsewhere.
"We'll ensure ILO standards in terms of compliance," said Siddique, who heads a newly created high-powered panel to inspect the country's 4,500 garment factories in an effort to avoid fresh disasters.
"We have seen that those who claim to be the best compliant factories in Bangladesh have not fully abided by building regulations," he added.
The Rana Plaza complex turned out clothing for Western retailers such as Britain's Primark and the Spanish label Mango.
