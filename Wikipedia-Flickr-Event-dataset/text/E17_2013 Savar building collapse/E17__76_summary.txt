Two years on, nearly $25 million in compensation has been paid out to survivors and relatives of the dead.
But Anwarul Islam Khandaker, a government official whose office has tallied the dead and missing, said 135 workers remain unaccounted for.
Mojtaba Kazazi, head of the Rana Plaza Claims Administration, said relatives of people classified as missing, presumed dead are among the 3,000 people to have received compensation.
Relatives of some two dozen missing workers may have not been compensated as they could not back up their claims with documentation, said Kazazi.
“We’ve included the relatives of missing workers as much as possible for compensation.
