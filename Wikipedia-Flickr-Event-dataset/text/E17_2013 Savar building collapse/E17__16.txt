New Wave Style, a garment factory that occupied three floors of the building, said at least half the casualties were women. Many children were also victims, as the company provided creche facilities.

As early as Tuesday, cracks were noticed in the structure of the building. Bangladesh's industrial police confirmed that they had ordered the evacuation of Rana Plaza, but thousands of people still reported for work yesterday. Some said they had returned on pain of dismissal after engineers working for the building's owner inspected the structure and pronounced it safe. Yesterday, all the upper floors of Rana Plaza collapsed, leaving only the ground floor intact. People joined soldiers in digging for survivors, some using their bare hands. Witnesses said they could hear those trapped inside reciting prayers and crying out for water. Four garment factories occupied six of the eight floors. New Wave Style, the largest of the factories, lists international retailers such as Benetton and Monsoon along with British high street names such as Primark, Matalan and Bonmarche among its main buyers.

Primark said its "ethical trade team" was "working to collect information, assess which communities the workers come from, and to provide support where possible". The incident raises further questions over safety and working conditions in Bangladesh's £13bn (€15.2bn) garment industry, which supplies many high street brands. (© Daily Telegraph, London)
