More than 370 people died when the eight-story Rana Plaza building crumbled into a vast pile of rubble on Wednesday.
Foreign offers to provide experienced disaster rescue teams, which could potentially have saved more lives, were turned down last week, diplomatic sources said.
Documents seen by The Daily Telegraph indicate both Bangladesh's foreign and home ministries rejected the offers because they feared that accepting aid would damage national pride.
A spokesman for Britain's Department for International Development confirmed it had offered "specialist technical advice" which Bangladesh had rejected.
He is accused of encouraging workers to return inside the Rana Plaza despite warnings from engineers it could collapse.
