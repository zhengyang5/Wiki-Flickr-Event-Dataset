Within two minutes the Rana Plaza structure was a mass of rubble, twisted metal, machinery and crushed and trapped bodies.
The building housed a shopping centre on the lower floors with five garment factories located on the third to eighth floors.
Those first on the scene were mainly local workers – relatives of those trapped, fellow garment workers from nearby workplaces or other shifts, rickshaw drivers, shop workers etc.
Yet at the time of the collapse the greedy Rana was even having a ninth floor added to this house of cards.
As a ‘precautionary measure’ the BGMEA announces that all garment factories will remain closed for the weekend.
