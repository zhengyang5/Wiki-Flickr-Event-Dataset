Bangladesh ordered 18 garment makers in two cities to close factories as the death toll from the collapse of a building last month rose to 804.
Garment factories in Bangladesh face increased scrutiny after the collapse of the building and a November fire that claimed 112 lives.
The South Asian government, workers, employers and the International Labour Organization agreed to a plan to improve workersâ€™ rights and safety.
The death toll is now 804, police inspector Mohammad Asaduzzaman said by phone from Savar, where the building collapsed.
Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and labor activists have been considering an agreement to improve factory safety in Bangladesh for at least two years.
