A Dhaka court today framed charges against Sohel Rana and 17 others in a case filed for violating building code in constructing the nine-storey Rana Plaza, which collapsed in 2013.
At least 1,136 people, mostly garment workers, were killed and more than 2,500 injured after the nine-storey building collapsed in Savar on April 24, 2013.
The Anti-Corruption Commission filed the case on June 15 in 2014 with Savar police against 17 people, excluding Rana.
The commission included Rana's name in the charge sheet as it found evidence of his involvement in violating the building code.
According to the case statement, the building authorities obtained permission for a six-storey building but later extended it by three more floors.
