But the owners of the garment factories on the upper floors ordered employees to work on Wednesday, despite the safety risks.
“I heard screams,” said Mahmudul Hasan, a quality inspector at Ether Tex, a garment factory, who was hit by a falling ceiling.
Bangladesh has the lowest labor costs in the world, with the minimum wage for garment workers set at roughly $37 a month.
Bangladesh now has more than 5,000 garment factories, employing more than 3.2 million workers, many of them women, and advocates credit the industry for lifting people out of poverty, even with such low wages.
In 2005, at least 64 workers at Spectrum Garments were killed in a building collapse.
