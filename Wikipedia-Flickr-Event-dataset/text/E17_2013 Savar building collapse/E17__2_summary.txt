Authorities are continuing to search the rubble for more bodies two weeks after the Rana Plaza building collapsed on 24 April.
Bangladesh has shut down 18 garment plants for safety reasons since the Rana Plaza disaster, the Bangladeshi textile minister has confirmed.
The move follows Monday's government announcement that a panel would inspect garment factories for building flaws.
Bangladesh has one of the largest garment industries in the world, and some of the clothes produced in the building were made for Western retailers.
The EU has said it is considering "appropriate action" to encourage an improvement in working conditions in Bangladesh factories.
