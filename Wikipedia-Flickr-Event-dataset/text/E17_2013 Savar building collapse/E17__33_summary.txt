The units started up after a power cut, sending powerful vibrations throughout Rana Plaza, said Main Uddin Khandaker, head of a government inquiry team.
Mr Khandaker told reporters that 15 minutes before the Rana Plaza collapsed in the Dhaka suburb of Savar on 24 April, it was affected by a power cut.
Abdur Razzak Khan acted as a consultant for Rana Plaza owner Mohammed Sohel Rana, who is accused of illegally adding more floors to the building.
Two other engineers are also in custody, along with Mr Rana, his father Abdul Khalek and four owners of garment factories that operated inside the building.
On Thursday, garment factories reopened across Bangladesh for the first time since the collapse.
