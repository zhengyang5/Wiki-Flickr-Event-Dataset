Police in Bangladesh filed the first formal murder charges Monday against dozens of individuals over the 2013 collapse of a garment factory building, killing more than 1,130 people.
The collapse of Rana Plaza, built on swampy ground outside the capital, Dhaka, ranks amongst the world's worst industrial accidents, and sparked an outcry for greater safety in the world's second-largest exporter of ready-made garments.
"We pressed charges against 42 people, including owner Sohel Rana, in two cases filed over the building collapse," said lead investigator Bijoy Krishna Kar, adding that one case was for murder and the other over a breach in construction rules.
In a separate case, the accused will also face charges of violating safety rules in building Rana Plaza because additional floors were added to the original five-story building, which was actually meant for office and shopping malls.
Rana was arrested after a four-day hunt shortly after the April 2013 building collapse, apparently trying to flee across the border to neighboring India.
