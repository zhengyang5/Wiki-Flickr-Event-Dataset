The Rana Plaza Donorâ€™s Trust Fund is backed by the International Labour Organization.
About $40 million (U.S.) is needed to pay 3,000 workers or the families of those killed when the Rana Plaza collapsed on April 24, 2013.
The process to begin paying compensation to the victims of the Rana Plaza collapse is less than two weeks away, but only seven of the 28 international brands linked to garment factories in the building have contributed to a fund.
The U.K. retailer Primark, said IndustriALL, is among the brands yet to make a contribution to the fund.
Signed by 156 global brands and retailers, it released its first inspection report earlier this week.
