It was hardly more than a whisper, but Sharmeen Begum recognised the voice as that of her daughter Sumi, who worked at a garment factory in the ill-fated Rana Plaza building outside Dhaka.
Sumi had been missing since Rana Plaza collapsed into a heap of rubble on Wednesday, killing at least 213 and trapping hundreds of others.
The walls on both sides of the road on which Rana Plaza is located are plastered with posters showing the smiling face of Sohel Rana, the owner of the collapsed commercial complex.
He used that clout in 2007 to start construction of Rana Plaza without permission from the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakkha (Rajuk), the agency in charge of building safety in greater Dhaka.
More than 700 garment workers have died since 2005 in Bangladesh, according to the International Labour Rights Forum, a Washington-based advocacy group.
