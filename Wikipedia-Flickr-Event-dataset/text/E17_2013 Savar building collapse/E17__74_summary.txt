A meeting among the world’s apparel retailers on proposed compensation for Rana Plaza victims ended inconclusive in Geneva on Friday, but they are scheduled to meet again on November 28.
“The long overdue final agreement on compensation to Rana Plaza victims is still not finalised as brands continue to hesitate,” said a statement of IndustriALL.
“How can the brands that sourced from Rana Plaza continue to refuse to pay?
“We are expecting to disburse compensation to the victims by January 14 next year,” IndustriALL Bangladesh representative Roy Ramesh Chandra told Dhaka Tribune on Saturday.
On 24 April 2013, Rana Plaza, an eight-story commercial building, collapsed in Savar killing over 11,00 workers and 2,500 sustained injuries.
