Survivors and families of the deceased gathered on Thursday to commemorate the victims of last year's Rana Plaza factory collapse, which killed more than 1,100 people, mostly garment workers, and injured 2,500 more.
Mourners laid floral wreaths at the site of the disaster, located 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the capital Dhaka.
The group has also asked for April 24 to be declared Labor Safety Day in the country.
The companies linked to the Rana Plaza disaster include the Spanish brand Mango, Italian brand Benetton and French retailer Auchan.
The Rana Plaza collapse is the worst ever disaster for Bangladesh's garment industry, a key part of the country's economy worth an estimated $20 billion (15.3 billion euros) annually.
