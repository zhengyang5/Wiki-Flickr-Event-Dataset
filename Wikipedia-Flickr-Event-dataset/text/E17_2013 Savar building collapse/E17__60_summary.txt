A court in Bangladesh has postponed the case of some 18 people facing trial for alleged construction code violations related to the Rana Plaza tragedy, when nearly 1,130 people lost their lives in a building collapse.
The April 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza building housing garment factories in Dhaka ranks among the world's worst industrial accidents.
