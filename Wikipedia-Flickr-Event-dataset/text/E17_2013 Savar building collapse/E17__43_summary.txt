Rana Plaza Our minivan heads towards Savar, a kind of satellite industrial area on Dhaka’s outskirts.

A strip of dusty waste ground, once the entrance to Rana Plaza, is now the site of a bleak memorial.
Sana and her small group of friends — ex-students, academics, political activists, journalists — spent days and weeks at Rana Plaza.
Hundreds of Rana Plaza workers and perhaps thirty Tazreen workers remain “missing.” For Sana and her colleagues, the search for them continues.
