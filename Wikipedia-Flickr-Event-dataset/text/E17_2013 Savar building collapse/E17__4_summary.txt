Another 29 bodies were pulled from the rubble of the Rana Plaza building in Savar overnight, bringing the total to 507, the army said.
Rescuers say they do not know how many people are still missing as factory owners have not given them precise figures.
On Thursday, garment factories across Bangladesh reopened for the first time since the collapse last week.
The EU has said it is considering "appropriate action" to encourage an improvement in working conditions in Bangladesh factories.
