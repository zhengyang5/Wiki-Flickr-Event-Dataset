The North American retailers plan to develop a common safety standard for the factories by October and to create a clearinghouse to share information among themselves about which factories have been approved for production and which need safety improvements.
That differs from the way retailers in the European-dominated plan take responsibility for safety violations.
The Europeans pledge to ensure that there is money to fix serious fire and building safety problems in any of the factories they use in Bangladesh.
Unlike the European group, the North American retailers are not promising to finance needed improvements, outside of the loans.
One retail executive said that the American retailers were worried about liability issues wrapped up in the heavily European accord.
