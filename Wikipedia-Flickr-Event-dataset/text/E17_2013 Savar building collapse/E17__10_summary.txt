At least 76 garment workers have been confirmed dead in Bangladesh after an eight-storey building containing clothing manufacturing units collapsed, officials say.
It has been confirmed that one of the manufacturers has previously supplied the UK discount fashion chain Matalan.
The building, in Savar, about 12 miles north of Dhaka, the capital, collapsed at 9am on Wednesday morning, after production had started at the building.
It housed four garment factories, where an estimated 5,000 workers were employed, plus a bank and some shops.
But shortly they, and the hundreds injured in the collapse, will be without income and without support.
