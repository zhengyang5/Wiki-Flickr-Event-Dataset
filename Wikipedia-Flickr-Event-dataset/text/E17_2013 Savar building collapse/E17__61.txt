The deputy Prime Minister was asked whether he buys clothes from bargain stores in the wake of the collapse of a Bangladeshi clothing factory, which killed hundreds of people.

The factory supplied shops including Primark, prompting questions over whether Western chains do enough to check the safety standards of their suppliers.

Speaking on his weekly Call Clegg LBC 97.3 radio phone-in, the Liberal Democrat leader said his family shops for the most "affordable" items like any other family.

Mr Clegg, a millionaire who lives in Putney with his wife and three sons, was asked whether he or his wife buy clothes from Primark and Matalan.

"We have. Yes, we've bought children's clothes... K-mart and... like any consumer you shop around and often you don't think about how something's produced. You've got three kids in tow on a Saturday afternoon. You rush in, you rush out.

"I'm not pretending our shopping choices are done on some sort of moral calculator, far from it. You go to the most convenient shop, you buy what's affordable, you try and get what you can in an affordable way for your kids."

Mr Clegg praised Primark for vowing to compensate families whose relatives died in the Bangladesh tragedy.

However, he said consumers have more power than they think when it comes to making choices about where they shop.

"I'm saying... there's more we could do to talk about what goes on behind the scenes and this terrible catastrophe might well prompt people to think again," he said.
