Hundreds of survivors of Bangladesh's worst industrial disaster have blocked a main highway to demand wages, as the death toll from the collapse of a nine-storey building passed 700.
Around 3,000 garment workers were on shift at the Rana Plaza complex at the time of the collapse on April 24.
Police say around 400 survivors blocked a highway connecting the capital with the country's south and southwest on Tuesday by staging a sitdown protest.
Factory workers have held protests calling for tough punishment for those responsible and stronger safety regulations.
