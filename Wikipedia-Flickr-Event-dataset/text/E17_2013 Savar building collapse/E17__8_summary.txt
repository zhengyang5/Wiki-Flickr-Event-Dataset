According to survivors several thousand workers and residents were in the building when it collapsed, but only 600 have so far been rescued.
Survivors said they had been evacuated from the building on Tuesday after several cracks appeared but their employers had ordered them to return to work this morning just one hour before the building collapsed.
The building, houses four garment factories which work 24 hours a day, a market, some residential apartments and a bank.
Government officials said the building was illegal while home minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir said the building may "have collapsed due to faulty construction."
"The managers forced us to rejoin and just one hour after we entered the factory the building collapsed with a huge noise.
