The Bangladeshi building that collapsed on Wednesday killing at least 87 people housed a garment factory that claims to supply a number of UK high street fashion retailers, according to reports.
The FT reports two affiliated factories, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms, operated out of the complex.
Their website suggests the company supplies a number of high street brands including Primark, Benetton and Monsoon.
"We can confirm that we have never placed any business with New Wave Style.
The country's garment industry is second only in size to China's, yet Bangladeshi workers are the lowest paid in the world.
