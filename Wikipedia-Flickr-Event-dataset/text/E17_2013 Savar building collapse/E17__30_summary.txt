"When the building started to collapse, workers thought they would be safe under the staircases.
Crews saw a woman waving her hand, and she shouted "I'm still here" and told rescuers her name was Reshma.
Within minutes, hundreds of soldiers and firefighters rushed to the scene to help clear the rubble, says the BBC's Akbar Hossain in Dhaka.
At least nine people have been arrested over the accident, including the owner of the building and several factory bosses.
