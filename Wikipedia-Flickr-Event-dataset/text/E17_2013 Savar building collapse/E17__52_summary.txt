Police said they have now recovered 705 dead bodies from the ruins of Rana Plaza, which housed a factory suppying the British retailers, Primark and Bonmarche.
Dhaka’s five main building inspectors told The Daily Telegraph that Rana Plaza was one of an estimated 20,000 new buildings currently being illegally used without final consent.
Like many without this certificate, Rana Plaza was neither built according to its plans nor used for the stated commercial purposes.
Afsar Uddin, the inspector for Dhaka’s central business districts Motiheel and Narayanganj said buildings without final occupation certificates are not allowed to have water and electricity connections.
His fellow inspector, Sukamal Chakma, who controls five Dhaka districts said few applied because their buildings had deviated from approved plans.
