The VICE Podcast is a weekly discussion which delves inside the minds of some of the most interesting, creative, and bizarre people we know. This week we sit down with American Apparel founder and Chief Executive Officer Dov Charney, who describes how he got his start in the clothing business and where he believes the industry should go next. Charney offers his perspective on the recent collapse of the Rana Plaza manufacturing facility in Bangladesh, which took the lives of over 1100 people. He calls for an international minimum wage to curb the exploitation of workers in the developing world, and he urges consumers to take more responsibility for the impact their purchasing decisions have on workers around the world.
