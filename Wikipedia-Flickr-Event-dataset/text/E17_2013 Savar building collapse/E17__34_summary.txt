A Dhaka court has fixed May 8 to pass an order on charge framing in a corruption case filed against 18 people, including building owner Sohel Rana, over the deadly Rana Plaza collapse in 2013.
The Rana Plaza tragedy made global headlines on April 24, 2013 when an eight-storey garment factory building in the Savar district north of Dhaka collapsed, killing over 1,100 people.
On June, 15, 2014, the ACC filed the case on charge of constructing Rana Plaza building with faulty design.
A month later, ACC Deputy Director M Mofidul Islam, also investigation officer of the case, submitted the charge-sheet against 18 people, including Sohel Rana, in the graft case.
The accused named in the charge-sheet include: Sohel Rana, and his parents Abdul Khaleque and Marjina Begum; Savar municipality mayor Refat Ullah; former chief executive officer of Savar municipality, Uttam Kumar Roy, and its executive engineer, Rafiqul Islam; former commissioner Haji M Ali Khan; architect ATM Masud Reza; Sajjad Hossain; and former town planner of Savar municipality, Farjana Islam.
