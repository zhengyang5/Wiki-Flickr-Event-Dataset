Most of the bodies were taken to the Enam Medical College from the site, which is located near the Savar Bus Stand.
More than 800 people were injured in what is easily one of the worst instances of building collapse ever in Bangladesh.
Savar Model Police Station OC Asaduzzaman said the rear of the building suddenly started to collapse around 8:30am.
According to the locals, many bodies were removed from the collapsed building, but many more are still trapped under the debris.
A nearby stall owner Sujon Mia told bdnews24.com the building collapsed suddenly with a loud sound.
