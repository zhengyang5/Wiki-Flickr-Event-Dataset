Rescuers and bystanders gather after an eight-story building housing several garment factories collapsed in Savar, near Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Wednesday.
He was pinned between slabs of concrete in the ruins of the garment factory building where he worked.
But officials at the garment factories operating inside ignored the order and kept more than 2,000 people working, authorities said.
The garment factories, though, kept working, ignoring the instructions of the local industrial police, said Mostafizur Rahman, a director of that police force.
The building collapse highlighted the dangers that workers still face.
