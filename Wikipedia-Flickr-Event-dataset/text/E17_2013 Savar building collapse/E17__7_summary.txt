Authorities said they had not yet determined what caused the collapse of the building, where five garment manufacturers employing about 2,500 workers were based, according to the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association.
Managers for the garment manufacturers housed inside the building could not be immediately reached for comment.
The third floor of the building was offices, garment manufacturers were on the fourth through seventh floors, and the top floor was a canteen.
The last major building collapse in the country occurred in 2005, when more than 70 people were killed in a garment factory collapse in the same area, the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha news service reported.
