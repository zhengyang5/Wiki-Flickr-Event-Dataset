KUALA LUMPUR - The Malaysian Red Crescent (MRC) has raised RM140,000 (S$55,000) in donations to help the victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.

In announcing this at a press conference here yesterday, MRC national chairman Tan Sri Shahriman Tunku Sulaiman said their target was to raise RM10 million by the end of February next year.

He said they would be sending a 13-man Rapid Deployment Squad (RDS) to the Philippines for four days from Tuesday to help the victims.

"Our past experiences in Aceh, Japan and Myanmar have shown us that Malaysians are generous and caring. I believe that it will be no different for the Philippines.

"I am sure they will donate generously to the cause."

He said MRC had also received support from AirAsia Group, which agreed to fund the expenses for the flight and cargo. This was also part of AirAsia's "To Philippines with Love" campaign.

"We also received support from other organisations that have come up with their own fundraising activities."

The organisations included the Australia International School Malaysia, Borders Malaysia, Groupon.my, MyDeal.com.my and Nexus International School.

Donations can be made to the Malaysian Red Crescent Society through its Malayan Banking Bhd account number 514422102657.
