Kim Kardashian eBays her old clothes to help Philippines typhoon victims... but donates just 10% of the proceeds to charity



The recent typhoon in The Philippines has claimed thousands of lives and left many struggling to access basic medical care.



And now, Kim Kardashian is bringing attention to their plight by launching an eBay sale of her clothes and accessories.



However, rather than donate the entire proceeds of the sale to non profit organisation International Medical Corps, the multi millionaire is only giving ten percent to the charity, according to the eBay posting.

Launching the sale on Thursday, the 33-year-old reality star tweeted a link to her personal website where she had written a personal letter.

'Hi guys, this is a very special auction because a portion of the proceeds of my eBay auction are going to International Medical Corps, a nonprofit organisation that provides critical health services on remote islands where families are struggling to access medical care and basic resources like food, clean drinking water and vital medications ,' she wrote.

'My prayers and thoughts are with those affected by the typhoon. Check out my eBay auction here and support those who need our help in the Philippines. Xo.'



Kim has a reported net worth of $40million.
