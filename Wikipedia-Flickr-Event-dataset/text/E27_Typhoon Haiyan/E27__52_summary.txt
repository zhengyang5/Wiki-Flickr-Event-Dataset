The national government has repeatedly said the breakdown in local governance has posed a huge challenge to the coordination of relief goods distribution.
Defense chief Voltaire Gazmin, however, said Wednesday night – after a closed door meeting of the national disaster management council – that relief goods would reach all of Leyte's 40 towns by Thursday, November 14.
Reports of desperate survivors ransacking rice and frustrated cries for help have raised concerns about the lack of organization in relief distribution following Yolanda, leading to criticisms of the national government.
The government has said it can tap up to P28.64 billion worth of funds for relief efforts.
To further speed up relief operations, two more distribution centers in will set up in Ormoc City in Leyte, and in Guiuan in Eastern Samar.
