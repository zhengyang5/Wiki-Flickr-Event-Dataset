"An estimated more than 1,000 bodies were seen floating in Tacloban as reported by our Red Cross teams," she told Reuters.
The Philippines has yet to restore communications with officials in Tacloban, a city of about 220,000.
Haiyan was the second category 5 typhoon to hit the Philippines this year after Typhoon Usagi in September.
An average of 20 typhoons strike every year, and Haiyan was the 24th so far this year.
Last year, Typhoon Bopha flattened three towns in southern Mindanao, killing 1,100 people and causing damage of more than $1 billion.
