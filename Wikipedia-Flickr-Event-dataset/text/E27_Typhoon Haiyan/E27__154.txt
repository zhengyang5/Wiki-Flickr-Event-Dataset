MANILA, Philippines (AP) - Grammy-winning singer Alicia Keys has visited an air force base in Manila to bring cheer to hundreds of evacuees from eastern Philippine provinces wracked by Typhoon Haiyan earlier this month.

The American singer distributed crayons and coloring books to children at the Villamor Air Base grandstand, where evacuees from eastern Leyte and Samar provinces arrive via C-130 planes.

Social Welfare Department officer Jane Abello says Keys stayed for about half an hour on Monday to chat with evacuees.

The R & B star is back in Manila for the second time for a concert at the seaside MOA Arena.

The Philippine Star earlier quoted her as saying that "music has a way of lifting your spirit and that's what I hope to do for the Filipino people".
