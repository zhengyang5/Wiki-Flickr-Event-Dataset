DJ David Guetta teamed up with the UN to help generate funds to provide aid to the Philippines.
He has partnered with the United Nations to kick off "The World Needs More ..." campaign to help victims of natural disasters and conflict.
It will also be streamed live on both Guetta's Facebook page and the campaign website, where the video will be featured exclusively.
Guetta has already sponsored #love.
To unlock the dollar donation from Guetta, for instance, share a double hashtag #theworldneedsmore# #love either on Twitter or the campaign website.
