MILWAUKEE, Nov. 20, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Nearly 11.3 million people across the Philippines have been affected by Typhoon Haiyan. The storm has displaced more than 500,000 and the need for food, shelter and medical services far exceeds supply.

Northwestern Mutual, through its Foundation, is responding by announcing a $100,000 grant to the American Red Cross to help get lifesaving support to those in the Philippines who need it most. This gift complements the two-year $500,000 grant, announced by the Northwestern Mutual Foundation last year, to the American Red Cross's Disaster Responder Program.

"Although the Philippines is thousands of miles away, the devastation created by the magnitude of this natural disaster affects all of us," said John Kordsmeier, president, Northwestern Mutual Foundation. "It can be difficult to imagine the extent to which this type of destruction decimates entire communities, but as a company, and as individuals, we must come together at this crucial time. Together, we can bring hope to those in such desperate need across the globe."

Additionally, in the Midwest, strong fall storms ravaged cities and towns, where members of Northwestern Mutual's financial representatives and clients live. More than 80 tornadoes were reported with this widespread storm, leaving many in need of shelter and food. The Northwestern Mutual Foundation has set up microsites for donations from employees and its financial representatives across the country that want to support the American Red Cross's efforts in the Midwest as well as the Philippines.
