Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the Philippines on Friday, the latest in a never-ending pattern of storms for the developing Southeast Asian nation.

The archipelago of more than 7,100 islands is hit by an average of 20 typhoons or tropical storms each year, which kill hundreds and sometimes thousands of people.
