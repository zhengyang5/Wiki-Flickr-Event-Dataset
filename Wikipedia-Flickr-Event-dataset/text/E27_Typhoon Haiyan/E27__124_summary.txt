Relief arriving in the Philippines, challenges for delivery persist13 November 2013 | MANILA, Philippines - WHO and partners are getting people and supplies into the Philippines, but reaching those in need remains challenging.
Teams of WHO and other emergency responders have been positioned or are en route to the areas hardest hit by Typhoon Haiyan.
Medicines and healthcare supplies have arrived in Cebu and are now waiting to be sent to areas in highest need.
WHO is supporting the Government of the Philippines in coordinating the deployment of international medical teams.
The teams are self-sufficient â€“ bringing their own hospital tents, supplies to perform surgeries, essential medicines and water, food and fuel.
