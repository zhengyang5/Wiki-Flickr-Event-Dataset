Govâ€™t vows transparency in aid utilizationMANILA, Philippines - As international aid continued to pour in for victims of Super Typhoon Yolanda, the government launched yesterday the Foreign Aid Transparency Hub or FAiTH, a pioneering web portal that allows the public to monitor foreign assistance to the country in response to calamities.
â€œContrary to what people think, foreign aid is not given to the Philippine government in hard cash.
Instead, it tracks foreign aid that is coursed through Philippine government agencies,â€ Moya said.
Budget Secretary Florencio Abad said that the governmentâ€™s efforts to boost foreign aid transparency should go hand-in-hand with civil society and donor initiatives to improve accountability in the management of disaster funding in line with the International Aid Transparency Initiative.
Foreign aid reaches P10.6 BForeign donations for the victims of Yolanda reached P10.6 billion as of yesterday, the DFA said.
