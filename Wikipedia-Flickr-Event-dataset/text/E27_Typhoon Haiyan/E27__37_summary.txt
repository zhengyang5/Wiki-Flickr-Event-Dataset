HONG KONG — While relief efforts for Typhoon Haiyan have been focused on the Philippine city of Tacloban, aid groups say other cities in Leyte Province have also suffered vast devastation, with residents facing increasing dangers with the passage of time.
One such place is Ormoc, a city of 190,000 on the opposite side of Leyte Province from Tacloban and the province’s second-largest city.
“They fear that aid will come into Ormoc and then bypass them to go to Tacloban,” since Ormoc has a functioning airport that can be used to deliver aid supplies to other parts of the province.
Also worrisome are increasing reports of illnesses like pneumonia and diarrhea, with residents living in rain-soaked, exposed structures and consuming contaminated food and water.
City officials put the latest death count in Ormoc at 31 people, with 1,779 people injured by the typhoon or in its aftermath.
