MANILA, Philippines - A fisherfolk group on Firday urged small fishermen and their families in Northern Iloilo to file criminal and other appropriate charges against the state-run National Power Corp. for its slow and inadequate response to an oil spill caused by super typhoon Yolanda.
In a press statement, Pamalakaya said the small fisherfolk and their families are suffering from the double whammy catastrophe -- Yolanda and the oil spill in Estancia.
Pamalakaya said more than 3,000 fishermen and their families have been affected by the oil spill.
The oil spill has been caused by a leak from the Napocorâ€™s Power Barge 103 which wound up to 300 kph detached from its moorings and slammed into the villageâ€™s rocky shores.
The 35-megawatt barge has a fuel storage capacity of 1.4 million liters.
