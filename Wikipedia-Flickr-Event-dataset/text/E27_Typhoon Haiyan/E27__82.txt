Indonesia to Send Typhoon Aid to Philippines

Indonesia will offer humanitarian aid to the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan’s deadly landfall, the president’s office said on Sunday.

“[The] president is concerned about the natural disaster that happened in the Philippines,” Presidential Spokesman Julian Aldrin Pasha told the Indonesian newspaper Kompas. “We are working on humanitarian aid which will be processed under the BNPB [National Disaster Mitigation Agency] and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.”

Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the Philippines on Saturday, leave a wide path of destruction in its wake. Coast towns and cities like Tacloban were hit hardest, where the typhoon laid waste to larger chunks of the 220,000-large city. By Sunday afternoon, disaster crews and the military had descended on the affected areas to provide aid.

Local officials worry as many as 10,000 people were killed in the storm.

“This is destruction on a massive scale. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris,” said Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, the head of a UN disaster assessment coordination team, in Tacloban.

Indonesia will take cues from similar disaster relief efforts and send food, water and generators, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. The nation has sent aid to Sichuan, China, and Tahiti in the past.

“The Indonesian ambassador in the Philippines has sent information [to us] that the most urgent necessities are drinking water, generators, medicine — especially antibiotics — and ready-to-eat meals,” Sutopo told the Jakarta Globe.

It will be the fourth time Indonesia provided the Philippines with disaster relief. The government sent the neighboring country some $400,000 in aid for landslide and flood victims in Oct. 2011, some $500,000 following the Dec. 2011 Washi Cyclone and some $1 million following the Bopha/Pablo cyclone in Jan. 2013.
