Ottawa will match donations from individual Canadians to help with the devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan, Canada's International Development Minister says.
Christian Paradis said Sunday that the government will set aside one dollar for the Typhoon Haiyan Relief Fund for every dollar donated by Canadians between Nov. 9 and Dec. 8.
Mr. Paradis said the money in the matching fund would be used to support relief efforts in the area.
For every dollar donated by individual Canadians to registered Canadian charities, the federal government will set aside one dollar for the typhoon relief fund.
Donations must also be specifically earmarked for typhoon relief.
