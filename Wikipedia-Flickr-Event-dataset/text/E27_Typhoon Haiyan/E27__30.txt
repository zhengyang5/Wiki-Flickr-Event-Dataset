The latest death toll has gone up to 7 in disaster areas in south China hit by Typhoon Haiyan, where 6 are killed in Hainan and one in Guangxi.

Over 2.3 million people are affected in Hainan province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in south China.

Typhoon Haiyan has been declining in strength since it arrived at Guangxi on Monday morning.

The National Meteorological Center has degraded the alert level, believing the typhoon will end in a few days.

The typhoon has brought rainstorms and floods to Guangxi and Hainan, destroying houses and damaging farmland.

Hainan provincial authorities said on Monday that Hainan has lost more than 4.9 billion yuan, equivalent to 803 million U.S. dollars, due to the typhoon.

The typhoon also caused a direct economic loss of 275 million yuan, or 45 million U.S. dollars in Guangxi, according to local authorities.

Haiyan, the strongest typhoon in the world so far this year, arrived in Guangxi on Monday morning after having wreaked havoc in the Philippines and Vietnam.
