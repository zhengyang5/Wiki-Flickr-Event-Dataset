BEIJING, Nov. 10 -- A level three emergency response was issued Saturday to prevent damage from the approaching Typhoon Haiyan, according to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.



The headquarters urged provinces of Hainan and Guangdong as well as Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to keep a close eye on Haiyan and upgrade their precautions.



Haiyan, the 30th and strongest typhoon to hit China this year, arrived at 6 p.m. on Saturday at the eastern area of South China Sea, 370 km to the southeast of Sansha city, Hainan, after having wreaked havoc in the Philippines. It will move northwestward at a speed of 30-35 km per hour, the headquarters said.



The central and southern parts of Hainan and Sansha city are expected to be hit by downpours on Saturday night and Sunday morning as Typhoon Haiyan approaches, the headquarters said.



All fishing boats were urged to return to ports by noon on Saturday. As of Saturday night, most had returned with a few still on their way back.



China has a four-level Typhoon emergency response system, with level one calling for a top emergency response, while level four represents the lowest.
