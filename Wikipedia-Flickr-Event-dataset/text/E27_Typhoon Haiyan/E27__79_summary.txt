Relief agencies including Hong Kong Red Cross and Oxfam have lashed out at the government's Disaster Relief Fund, saying it is too rigid to support their operations in the Philippines.
Red Cross and Oxfam representatives told an RTHK programme yesterday that Hongkongers remained generous when it came to helping disaster victims around the world.
On Friday, lawmakers approved adding HK$40 million to the Disaster Relief Fund.
Agencies can apply for funds to cover relief work.
DAB lawmaker Starry Lee Wai-king, a member of the fund's advisory committee, admitted that restrictions were in place which may limit the relief work being carried out.
