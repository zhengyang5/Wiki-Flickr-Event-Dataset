One of the most powerful storms on record devastated the central Philippines, as authorities fear it killed an estimated 10,000 people in one city alone.
Two days after Typhoon Haiyan hit the central Philippines, the death toll is feared to be rising into the thousands.
Earlier, the Philippine Red Cross told Reuters that based on reports it estimated at least 1,200 were dead in Tacloban and 200 more in Samar Province.
Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said Aquino was "speechless" when he told him of the devastation the typhoon had wrought in Tacloban.
About 4 million people were affected by the typhoon, the Philippine Red Cross said.
