In a statement sent to the Inquirer, Spanish Ambassador Jorge Domecq said the Philippines has been “the main recipient of Spanish humanitarian aid worldwide,” with some 26 million Euros, or P1.5 billion, in aid since 2007.
“Please believe us, we wish they (aid) would not have been needed and we hope they will not be needed in the future,” the envoy said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENTDomecq said Spain’s typhoon relief aid comprised both bilateral aid and assistance coursed through multilateral organizations including the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) and the World Food Programme.
The Spanish government also chartered two flights that brought 35 tons of humanitarian aid to the disaster area.
Spain has also been funding a resilience-building program in Albay province, which aims to strengthen local government responders in the face of natural disasters.
