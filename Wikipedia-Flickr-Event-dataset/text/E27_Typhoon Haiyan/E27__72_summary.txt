Aid is coming to Tacloban: medical supplies, pallets of water and food piled on trucks, planes and ferries, sent by the Philippine government and countries around the world.
"We are in contact with the authorities, but the (Tacloban) airport is only for the Philippines military use," said a spokesman from Médecins Sans Frontières, Lee Pik Kwan, in a telephone interview.
At the medics' intended destination, thousands of typhoon victims were trying to get out.
In Latin America, the Chilean government pledged earlier this week to send humanitarian aid to the Philippines and noted that it had been in contact with the about 50 Chileans residing in the country.
Tacloban, a city of about 220,000 people on Leyte island, bore the full force of the winds and the tsunami-like storm surges.
