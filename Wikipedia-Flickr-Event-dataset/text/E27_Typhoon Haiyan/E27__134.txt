The Los Angeles Lakers are reaching out to the victims of Super Typhoon Haiyan that recently caused widespread destruction and death across the Philippines. The Lakers announced that they will donate $150,000 to the Philippine Red Cross.

The check for $150,000 will be presented by Kobe Bryant at the Lakers next home game against the Memphis Grizzlies on Nov. 15, 2013.

Also, the Lakers are donating all proceeds from the Lakers Youth Foundation In-Arena Auctions between Nov. 12 and Nov. 24. These auctions take place at all Lakers home games.

The Super Typhoon displaced more than 600,000 people and some early estimates put the death toll at 10,000. According to CNN, the Super Typhoon hit the Philippine islands with winds that were 3.5 time as strong as Hurricane Katrina. A 15-foot high wall of water completely washed away several towns and islands.

The initial estimates of 10,000 have since been lowered, and the death toll stood at 2,357 as of Thursday morning.

The Lakersâ€™ donations are meant to assist the more than 2 million people currently in need for food.

Authorities had stated that 800,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, but even those evacuations could not avoid the loss of life and unimaginable destruction that has taken place.

In addition to the financial offerings, the Lakers are urging fans to donate to the relief effort via lakers.com/typhoonrelief.
