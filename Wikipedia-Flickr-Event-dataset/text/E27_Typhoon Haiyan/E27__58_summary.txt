Image caption Much of the city of Tacloban has been destroyedOne week after Typhoon Haiyan ravaged the central Philippines, aid has begun to arrive in the city of Tacloban, one of the worst-affected areas.
Many crossed the street and joined the end of a long line, maybe 1,000 long, waiting in the hope of food aid.
They'd heard it was due to be distributed at the Tacloban Convention Centre - itself damaged, but still a new home for thousands.
Inside the gates of the Convention Centre, the line became more of a gathering and where it ended there was nothing.
While we were at the Convention Centre no food arrived, let alone was given out to people.
