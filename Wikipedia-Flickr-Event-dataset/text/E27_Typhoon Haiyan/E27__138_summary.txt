Mercy Corps, the Portland-based relief organization, is sending an assessment team to the Philippines, where a typhoon has devastated the country’s midsection.
Two staff members are preparing to depart as soon as possible, and more could follow, Lindsay Murphy, a Mercy Corps spokeswoman, said Sunday.
The “emergency response team” will survey the situation and decide how Mercy Corps aid workers can best help, she said.
Based on conversations with United Nations officials, Mercy Corps anticipates the most pressing needs to be clean water, sanitation, temporary shelter and food.
The storm’s impact zone includes 20 development project areas where World Vision works with more than 35,000 sponsored children and their communities.
