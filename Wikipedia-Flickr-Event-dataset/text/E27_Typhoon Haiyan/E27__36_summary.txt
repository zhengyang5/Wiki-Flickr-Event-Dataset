The aid comes amid heightened insecurity and tension in the city, where reports of gunshots, stabbings and ambushes have caused many residents and aid workers to fear for their lives.
On Wednesday night the Tacloban mayor, Alfred Romualdez, led a mass burial in a graveyard just outside the city.
Officials said every effort had been made to ensure those buried could be identified in the weeks to come.
The fact that many aid workers had arrived in Tacloban but little aid had yet been distributed was creating a security concern, one aid worker told the Guardian.
Much of the devastation wrought by Haiyan occurred in the Philippines' agricultural belt, with the majority of residents in Leyte and Samar working on farms or as fishermen.
