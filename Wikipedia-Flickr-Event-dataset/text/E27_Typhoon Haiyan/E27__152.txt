The band performed in the country the night before the storm made landfall and they were forced to leave the region ahead of schedule to avoid the chaos.

One Republic frontman Ryan Tedder tells U.S. breakfast show Today, "We were just in Southeast Asia, we played the Philippines... and that night the promoter came back, right before the show, and said, 'Guys, there's a typhoon coming in tomorrow. In theory, it's going to be the biggest typhoon that has ever hit the Philippines, so get to the airport early, we got to get you out of here..' So we missed it by about three or four hours."

The band's donation will benefit Save The Children relief workers' efforts.

The band members are not the only celebrities to give cash to charities based in the Philippines - Rihanna and Ludacris have recently donated Â£66,000 and E33,300, respectively, to organisations active in the region.

Typhoon Haiyan ravaged the Asian nation, claiming the lives of nearly 5,600 people and leaving thousands homeless.
