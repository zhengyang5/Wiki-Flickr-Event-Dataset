Journey is donating $350,000 to help relief efforts in the Philippines, and its lead singer has a message for his homeland: "Don't Stop Believin'."

Arnel Pineda and the rest of the band announced the donation on Friday. It will go to the United Nations World Food Programme, which is providing Filipinos with food assistance. The donation should provide 1.4 million meals.

In a statement, Pineda referenced the group's famous "Believin'" song and said "help is on the way."

Journey made the donation along with Live Nation Entertainment, Creative Artists Agency and their manager, John Baruck.

The Philippines were devastated by Typhoon Haiyan, which has left more than 3,600 dead and displaced 600,000, according to authorities. Journey is also calling on fans to donate to the cause.
