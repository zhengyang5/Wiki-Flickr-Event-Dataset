MANILA, Philippines - Two New Peopleâ€™s Army (NPA) rebels were killed by alert government security forces who foiled the rebelsâ€™ plot to ambush a government relief convoy bound for the storm-devastated Samar province in Matnog, Sorsogon early Tuesday morning.
Col. Joselito Kakilala, 902rd Brigade commander based in the province, identified the slain NPA leaders as Ka Abel, NPA commander in Sorsogon and Ka Win, Sentro de Gravidad NPA commander in Bicol, a rebel unit under the overall leadership of Jesus Guelas alias Ka Gapa and Ka Insoy.
â€œAn NPA plan to ambush a government relief convoy to Samar-Leyte was foiled.
Two NPA commanders were killed in the fighting by joint Army elements,â€ Kakilala said.
Matnog now serves as the key supply point of government and non-government relief goods being shipped via land for the thousands of Typhoon Yolanda-ravaged residents in Samar and Leyte provinces.
