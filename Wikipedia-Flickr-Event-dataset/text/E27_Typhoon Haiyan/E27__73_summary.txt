Danish support to the Filipino victims of Typhoon HaiyanLast Friday, one of the strongest typhoons ever ravaged the Philippines, affecting the lives of 4.3 million people.
As an initial rapid response, Denmark has allocated DKK 10 million for emergency aid in the hardest hit areas.
In the next few days, the UN is expected to issue a formal emergency aid appeal.
This support will be delivered through a cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and the Danish Emergency Management Agency.
The Danish Red Cross will also deploy staff to assess the location and operation of a potential camp to help the relief efforts.
