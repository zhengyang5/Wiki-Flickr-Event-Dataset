The Philippines is helped by the Voting and Downloads on tonight’s X Factor.
Simon Cowell has tweeted information that tonight the X Factor has backed up The Sun’s campaign for the Philippines appeal and that the profits from voting and downloads will go towards decappeal.
They have also agreed to donate 15 pence of the money that goes to the votes for contestants on X Factor.
Which is why the X Factor have responded to lend a hand with such a gesture.
Helping the Philippines through voting and downloads on tonight’s X Factor will hopefully raise plenty of money as they reach out to their 12 million viewers.
