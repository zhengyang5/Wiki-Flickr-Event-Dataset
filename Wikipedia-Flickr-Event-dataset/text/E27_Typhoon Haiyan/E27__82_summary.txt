Indonesia to Send Typhoon Aid to PhilippinesIndonesia will offer humanitarian aid to the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan’s deadly landfall, the president’s office said on Sunday.
“[The] president is concerned about the natural disaster that happened in the Philippines,” Presidential Spokesman Julian Aldrin Pasha told the Indonesian newspaper Kompas.
Indonesia will take cues from similar disaster relief efforts and send food, water and generators, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The nation has sent aid to Sichuan, China, and Tahiti in the past.
It will be the fourth time Indonesia provided the Philippines with disaster relief.
