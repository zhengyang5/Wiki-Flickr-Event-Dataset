KEVIN CONNOR | QMI AGENCYTORONTO - Disaster and death are calling Toronto paramedic Pepito Biclar home to the Philippines.
“I feel I can contribute the most because I know the community and medical community,” Biclar told the Toronto Sun before deploying Friday to his birthplace of Iloilo.
Turner knows what shantytowns in the disaster area are like and said there wasn’t a chance they could stand up to such a storm.
“(In the Philippines) I am expecting and anticipating the worst, but I want to help them get through it,” Turner said.
Biclar and Turner are just two examples of first responders and medical professionals volunteering to help, said GlobalMedic executive director Rahul Singh, a Toronto paramedic.
