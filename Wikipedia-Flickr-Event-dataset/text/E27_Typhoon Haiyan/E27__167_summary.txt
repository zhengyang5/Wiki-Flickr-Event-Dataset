The extreme weather events that the world is experiencing are consistent with the effects of anthropogenic climate change.
The 2013 Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan was the strongest tropical cyclone in recorded history to make landfallâ€”causing more than 6000 deaths in the Philippines, mostly from storm surge.
On the other hand, climate change has been driven by the carbon emissions of industrialized states.
Those who call for climate justice argue for more robust measures to control carbon emissions responsible for climate change and worsening global health security.
