"Following instructions issued by the Russian government and requests received from the Philippines, the Emergency Situations Ministry has sent two [Ilyushin] Il-76 airplanes with an airborne hospital, doctors, rescuers and psychologists onboard," he said.

"The planes will make two stopovers for refueling - in Krasnoyarsk and in Khabarovsk," he added.

The Russian rescuers and doctors en route to the typhoon-stricken areas of the Philippines have been provided with advanced equipment and all-terrain vehicles, which will allow them to operate autonomously.
