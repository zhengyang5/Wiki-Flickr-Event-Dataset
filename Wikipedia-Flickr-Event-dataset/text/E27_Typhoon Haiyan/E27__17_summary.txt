Official: Super Typhoon Death Toll Could Reach 10,000By By Eric Leister, Meteorologist November 15, 2013, 6:31:57 AM ESTIn the wake of once-Super Typhoon Haiyan (local name Yolanda), the death toll has climbed to over 3,600 with more than 12,000 injured and more missing according to the Philippines government.
A senior regional police official and a city administrator in the typhoon-ravaged Tacloban city in the central Philippines say the death toll there could reach 10,000 people as reported by the Associated Press.
With wires, trees and debris cutting off access to these areas, aid has been struggling to reach victims and unable to determine a final death toll.

"Three other cyclones [Nari, Utor and Krosa] have crossed the Philippines at typhoon strength so far this year.
