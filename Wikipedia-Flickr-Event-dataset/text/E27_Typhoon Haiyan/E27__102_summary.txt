King Abdullah bin Abdelaziz, of Saudi Arabia, ordered on Friday a $10 million donation for the typhoon- stricken Philippines.
Saudi Finance Minister Ibrahim al- Assaf made the announcement, saying the amount will be transferred to a special account in coordination with the Philippine government, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
Saudi Arabia gave its condolences to the Philippines last week in a telegram that the Saudi monarch addressed to President Benigno Aquino.
â€œWe have heard the painful news of the typhoon that struck your friendly country which resulted in deaths, injuries and damage.
The United Arab Emirates also announced $10 million support and assistance program for the Philippines.
