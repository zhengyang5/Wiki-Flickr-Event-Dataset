While relief operations have gained speed over the past days, counting the dead, missing and injured has stalled.
On Friday, Del Rosario said no other agency would release the official death toll after the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported a higher death toll.
Days later, the Eastern Visayas regional police director who was quoted as placing the death toll at 10,000 was relieved of his post.
Most of the casualties on official count were from the Eastern Visayas where 3,725 were confirmed dead, according to the NDRRMC.
“In any case, most people avoid drinking water from any source that may have been in contact with dead bodies or other causes of contamination,” Patino added.
