Haiyan – or Yolanda as it is called in the Philippines – is the third major disaster to hit the country in the past two months.
"This is a trifecta of disasters," said Leonard Doyle, head of online communications at the UN's International Organisation of Migration.
We have no idea of the consequences yet, but it's going to be devastating by the time the dust settles.
"We expect the level of destruction caused by typhoon Haiyan to be extensive and devastating," said Anna Lindenfors, Save the Children's country director for the Philippines.
We will be distributing emergency kits for children and families, including toiletries, cleaning items, temporary school tents and education materials."
