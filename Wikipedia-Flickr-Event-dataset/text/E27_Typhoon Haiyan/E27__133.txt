The first members of DHL's disaster response team are currently in the Philippines providing on-the-ground logistics support to assist with the relief effort in the aftermath of the devastating Typhoon Haiyan. The team are based at the regional Mactan Cebu Airport on Cebu island, just to the West of the country's most affected Leyte Island, including Tacloban city, where hundreds have died. They have set up a warehouse to help sort relief goods which are then transported to those in need as quickly as possible. Goods sent by the international community via both air and sea will be sorted by the team.

DHL CEO Frank Appel said, "The situation in the Philippines, and in particular in Leyte province, is simply devastating, and there is a critical need to provide food and water to the people affected as quickly as possible. Our Disaster Response Team is trained to provide logistics support to the relief effort at local airports following a natural disaster and we welcome this opportunity to contribute our knowledge and skills now in the Philippines. We know that in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, regional airport logistics can very often encounter bottlenecks which delay the delivery of life-sustaining relief supplies for victims. Here, we can make a difference with our logistics expertise at a crucial point in the relief effort and help to ensure swift and organized handling of all incoming materials."
