(CNN) -- With 25 million people in its path, Super Typhoon Haiyan -- one of the strongest storms recorded on the planet -- smashed into the Philippines on Friday morning.
The typhoon was forecast to churn across the central Philippines during Friday and part of Saturday before exiting into the South China Sea.
The storm is expected to weaken slightly as it moves across land, but forecasters predict that it will maintain super typhoon intensity throughout its passage over the islands.
A super typhoon has surface winds that sustain speeds of more than 240 kph for at least a minute, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
An average of 20 typhoons hit the archipelagic nation every year, and several of those cause serious damage.
