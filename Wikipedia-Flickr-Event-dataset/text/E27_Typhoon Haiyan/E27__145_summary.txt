This was just two days after the INC conducted a massive relief and medical mission in Ormoc City.
The INCâ€™s relief distribution began at around 8 a.m., with people lining up the street fronting the INC chapel, starting early morning.
Before the relief distribution, INC general auditor Glicerio Santos Jr. addressed those gathered in the INC district worship building.
â€œThis will make the people here feel loved and cared for, and this is more important.â€œDuring the relief mission, people were anxious to get their share of relief packs.
Before lunchtime, more than a hundred thousand relief packs had been distributed.
