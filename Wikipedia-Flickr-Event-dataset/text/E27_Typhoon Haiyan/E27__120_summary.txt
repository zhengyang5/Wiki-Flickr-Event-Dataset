TACLOBAN, Philippines – The United States is providing nearly $25 million in additional humanitarian aid to help the Philippines deal with the enormous devastation and deaths wrought by Typhoon Haiyan last month.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry flew to worst-hit central Tacloban city Wednesday and announced the additional food aid, shelter materials, water and other supplies for typhoon-lashed families after surveying battered villages and consoling survivors.
The U.S. assistance package has reached $86 million with the new aid to one of its closest Asian allies.
