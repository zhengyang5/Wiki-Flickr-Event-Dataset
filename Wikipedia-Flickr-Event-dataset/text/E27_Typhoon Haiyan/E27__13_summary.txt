Ha Noi, 12 November – As northern Viet Nam recovers from the impact of Typhoon Haiyan, which killed thousands in the Philippines, the UN praises the Government of Viet Nam’s proactive prestorm measures, which have helped to save lives and mitigate impact.
After making landfall, Haiyan quickly weakened into a tropical depression as it moved further inland, and changed its course to head towards southern China.
For the first time, the Prime Minister activated the highest state of preparedness on the 8th November, three days before the storm made landfall.
“We are impressed by the extraordinary preparedness measures taken by the Government when confronted with this storm.
Typhoon Haiyan was the 14th storm of this storm season, so both civil and military authorities were fully prepared.
