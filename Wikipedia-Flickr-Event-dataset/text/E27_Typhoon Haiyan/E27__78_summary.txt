The Legislative Council yesterday approved a HK$40 million injection to the government's disaster relief fund to ensure there is enough cash for local charities to help those hit by Super Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.
"We are very, very worried about millions of children," UN Children's Fund spokesman Marixie Mercado said in Geneva.
But Choi emphasised the funding would be used only by relief groups, not officials.
Sailors from the USS George Washington aircraft carrier and accompanying ships yesterday took food and water ashore into Tacloban and the town of Guiuan.
A Norwegian merchant navy vessel arrived at Tacloban with UN World Food Programme aid, including 6,200 body bags.
