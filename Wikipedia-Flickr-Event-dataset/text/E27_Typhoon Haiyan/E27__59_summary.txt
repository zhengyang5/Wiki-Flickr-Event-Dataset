Medical teams are operating in the worst-affected areas and US helicopters flying aid to isolated settlements.
The US military said it would send about 1,000 more troops along with additional ships and aircraft to join the aid effort.
Although a huge international aid effort is under way, widespread infrastructure damage is hampering efforts to distribute it to some areas.
