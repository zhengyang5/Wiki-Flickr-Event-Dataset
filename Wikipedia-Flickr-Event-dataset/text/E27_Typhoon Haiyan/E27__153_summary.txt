Linkin Park and the Offspring are teaming for a fundraiser in L.A. early next year to benefit victims of the Philippines’ Typhoon Haiyan.
The alternative rock groups will play the “Concert for the Philippines” at Club Nokia on Jan. 11, with more guests to be announced in the weeks ahead.
The benefit gig is an initiative of Music For Relief, a disaster aid charity founded by members of Linkin Park.
According to organizers of the Club Nokia show, 500 tickets will be available to fans who donate or raise at least $250 for Music for Relief’s Typhoon Relief effort at www.musicforrelief.org.
A slew of superstar artists have contributed tracks for the "Songs for the Philippines" fundraising album, while the iTunes store is taking donations for the American Red Cross.
