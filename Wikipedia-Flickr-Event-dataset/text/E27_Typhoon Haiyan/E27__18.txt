A typhoon thought to be the most powerful ever to hit land battered the central Philippines on Friday, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and killing four as it toppled power lines and blew apart houses.

There were fears the death toll could rise sharply as communications in the worst hit areas were cut off and forecasters warned of catastrophic damage before the storm left the Philippines on Friday evening.

Haiyan, a category-5 super typhoon, tore a path across the archipelago from east to west, pummeling the islands of Leyte, Samar, Cebu and Panay with 170mph wind gusts, torrential rain and 15-19ft waves.

Two people were electrocuted by falling power lines while a third victim was struck by lightning, said Reynaldo Balido, spokesman for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Another person was crushed by a tree, officials reported.

Experts warned the impoverished country would likely need international help in the wake of the mammoth storm.

Dr Steven Godby, an expert in disaster management at Nottingham Trent University, said that successive emergencies in the archipelago, including recent outbreaks of fighting and a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in October, had left government agencies overstretched. “Given the potential magnitude of the typhoon’s impact, additional 'surge’ support from the international community may be required,” he suggested.

Roger Mercado, governor of Southern Leyte said the immense storm had set off landslides that blocked roads, ripped trees from the ground and tore roofs off houses around his residence.

The skies had turned so dark it was as if the island had been plunged into night, he said.

“When you’re faced with such a scenario, you can only pray, and pray and pray,” he told The Associated Press by telephone, adding that he had received no word from mayors in the area.

“I hope that means they were spared and not the other way around,” he said. “My worst fear is there will be massive loss of lives and property.”

“We have put rescue teams and equipment at different places, but at the moment we can’t really do much because of the heavy rain and strong winds. There is no power,” Philippine Red Cross chief Gwendolyn Pang said.

Winds thought to be up to 195 mph when the storm hit land would make Haiyan the “strongest tropical cyclone on record to make landfall”, said Jeff Masters, a hurricane expert and director of meteorology at US-based Weather Underground. Experts noted that such figures were estimates that would require further analysis. But Ray Bell, a tropical storm expert from the University of Reading, said it was certainly one of the strongest storms ever recorded. “Super Typhoon Haiyan really is a beast,” he said, adding that as with Superstorm Sandy on the East Coast of the United States, much of the damage would come from the “storm surge” as strong winds blew sea water onshore.

Up to a million people had fled to shelters after Philippine President Benigno Aquino urged those in Haiyan’s path to evacuate from high risk areas such as river banks, coastal villages and mountain slopes.

“Our school is now packed with evacuees,” a primary school teacher in southern Leyte who identified herself only as Feliza told a radio station. Leyte and southern Leyte are about 390 miles southeast of the capital Manila.

“Please do not underestimate this typhoon. It is very powerful. We can feel each gust,” Roger Mercado, governor of southern Leyte province, adjacent to Leyte, told DZBB radio. “We lost power and all roads are impassable because of fallen trees. We just have to pray.”

Residents of Manila were braced for the impact of the typhoon as evening approached, with workers rushing home from offices before the storm hit.

The state weather bureau said Haiyan was expected to leave the Philippines on Saturday and head towards the South China Sea, where it could pick up further force and threaten Vietnam or China.

Mr Masters said the previous record for the strongest typhoon to make landfall was Hurricane Camille, which hit Mississippi in the United States with sustained winds of 190 miles an hour in 1969.

An average of 20 typhoons slam into the Philippines every year. The archipelago is particularly vulnerable to intense storms because it is often the first major landmass to be hit after they build over the Pacific Ocean. In 2011, typhoon Washi killed 1,200 people, displaced 300,000 and destroyed more than 10,000 homes. Haiyan is the 24th such storm to batter the Philippines this year.
