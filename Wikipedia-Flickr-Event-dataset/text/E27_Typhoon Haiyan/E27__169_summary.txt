WARSAW, Poland—After Philippine climate negotiator Naderev "Yeb" Saño's tearful speech at the opening session of the UN climate conference here, delegates from different countries have joined him in fasting.
He also announced that he will fast until he sees stronger action against climate change at the talks, in solidarity with the typhoon-ravaged Filipinos.
"For too long there’s been inaction, and this is something we think can bring attention to the true suffering of the victims of climate change," he said.
In particular, he wants developed countries, especially the worst polluters, to commit to putting money into the green climate fund, which aims to help developing countries cope with climate change.
"This conference won't come to a close without us resolving issues, especially when we talk about rich countries' ambitions to address climate change."
