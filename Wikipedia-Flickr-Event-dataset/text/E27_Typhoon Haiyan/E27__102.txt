King Abdullah bin Abdelaziz, of Saudi Arabia, ordered on Friday a $10 million donation for the typhoon- stricken Philippines.

Saudi Finance Minister Ibrahim al- Assaf made the announcement, saying the amount will be transferred to a special account in coordination with the Philippine government, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.

Saudi Arabia gave its condolences to the Philippines last week in a telegram that the Saudi monarch addressed to President Benigno Aquino.

“We have heard the painful news of the typhoon that struck your friendly country which resulted in deaths, injuries and damage. We are sure you can overcome this disaster and we present you and the families of the victims and the people of the Philippines on behalf of the people and the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia our deep condolences and sincere sympathy, hoping you will not see any harm,” the telegram read.

The death toll from last week’s super typhoon is now at least 4,460, the United Nations said on Friday, citing regional officials. The country’s national disaster council maintained a much lower figure.

The United Arab Emirates also announced $10 million support and assistance program for the Philippines.

World powers have also mobilized emergency aid over the past week. The United States and Britain sent on Monday several warships, including an aircraft carrier.

Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful storms on record, struck six central Philippine islands last week, wiping away buildings and leveling seaside homes with ferocious winds of 235 kilometers per hour.
