Officials in the Philippines, a country with a long-standing reputation for official corruption, are hoping to give faith to foreign donors that they can manage the millions of dollars in relief aid pouring in following Typhoon Haiyan.

On Monday the government launched an online portal, the Foreign Aid Transparency Hub, or FAiTH, which will contain detailed information about where aid is coming from, and will allow users to track where the aid went and how it was used.
