HONG KONG — While relief efforts for Typhoon Haiyan have been focused on the Philippine city of Tacloban, aid groups say other cities in Leyte Province have also suffered vast devastation, with residents facing increasing dangers with the passage of time.

One such place is Ormoc, a city of 190,000 on the opposite side of Leyte Province from Tacloban and the province’s second-largest city. Both cities experienced storm surges of 13 feet in Friday’s typhoon. While the typhoon appears to have killed far fewer people in Ormoc, aid groups say that more than 90 percent of the city’s structures have been destroyed or damaged, leaving residents exposed to the elements as food shortages become an increasing problem.

“People are worried that the aid will bypass them,” said Julien Anseau, the Asia communications manager for ChildFund International, who was in the city Wednesday surveying the damage. “They fear that aid will come into Ormoc and then bypass them to go to Tacloban,” since Ormoc has a functioning airport that can be used to deliver aid supplies to other parts of the province.

Mr. Anseau described a worsening food supply situation, as stores had largely been emptied of their stocks and relief was only slowly starting to trickle in. Also worrisome are increasing reports of illnesses like pneumonia and diarrhea, with residents living in rain-soaked, exposed structures and consuming contaminated food and water.

“It’s continuing to rain as well, so water is coming right into the housing,” he said.

City officials put the latest death count in Ormoc at 31 people, with 1,779 people injured by the typhoon or in its aftermath. Hospitals were either shut down or not fully functioning.
