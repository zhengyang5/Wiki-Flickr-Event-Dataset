Image caption The size of China's aid offering to the Philippines sparked mixed feelings from its citizensChina has said it is sending $1.6m (Â£1m) to the Philippines to help with the aid effort following Typhoon Haiyan.
True, China's initial donation paled beside the $20m given by the United States or the $10m pledged by Japan - or even the $2m donated by Indonesia.
State media here has recently expended a lot of energy presenting the Philippines as hostile to Beijing, so China's aid to Manila has put nationalist newspapers here in the unusual position of guiding public opinion towards sympathy for the Philippines.
China's latest pledge of $1.6m still looks pointedly small besides its previous aid packages to other nations - even to Japan, with whom it is also squabbling over territory.
But with 10 dead and an estimated $734m of damage, China's loss does not diminish the impact of its message to Manila.
