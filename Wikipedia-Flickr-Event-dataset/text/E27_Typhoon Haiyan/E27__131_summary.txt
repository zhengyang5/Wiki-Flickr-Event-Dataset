Even while Coke sales are declining, the soft drink giant is still putting its advertising on hold to focus on a more important cause.
Coca-Cola announced last week that the company is suspending its brand advertising in the Philippines so that it can donate its entire ad budget to typhoon relief efforts.
While many supporters have lauded Coke’s efforts in helping typhoon victims, some have questioned whether suspending ads is a marketing ploy in and of itself.
“People will find out what they did, think they are a better company because of it, and buy their product to support it.
As great as it is it still gives them advertising.”Self serving or not, we support any initiative raising awareness for the Philippines.
