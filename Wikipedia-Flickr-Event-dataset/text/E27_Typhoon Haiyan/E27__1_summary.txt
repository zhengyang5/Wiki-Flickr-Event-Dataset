Why Typhoon Haiyan Caused So Much DamageEnlarge this image toggle caption NOAA Environmental Visualization Laboratory NOAA Environmental Visualization LaboratoryThe deadly typhoon that swept through the Philippines was one of the strongest ever recorded.
Super Typhoon Haiyan could be the strongest on record, but scientists can't say for sure because they don't have direct measurements of the wind speed.
Scientists at the U.S. Navy/Air Force's Joint Typhoon Warning Center infer that Haiyan produced sustained wind speeds of around 190 or 195 mph at its peak.
The strongest hurricane or typhoon winds on record were from Camille, which struck the U.S. Gulf Coast in 1969.
To find out whether Haiyan had record-breaking winds, scientists may turn to amateurs for information.
