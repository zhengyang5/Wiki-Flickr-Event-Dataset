Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines at 4am local time today with winds near 195 mph, making it the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in recorded world history, according to satellite estimates.
That same region will experience strong winds and heavy rain from this typhoon.
That’s good enough to rank Haiyan as almost assuredly the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the Philippines.
Such strong storms usually remain out at sea where wind speed verification is impossible without aircraft.
A storm surge of this magnitude—rare for the Philippines—would be especially devastating for coastal areas.
