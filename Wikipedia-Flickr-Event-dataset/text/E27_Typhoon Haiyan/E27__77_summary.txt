VATICAN CITY — The Vatican on Monday announced it is donating $150,000 (112,000 euro) in emergency aid to the Philippines after Super Typhoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) devastated entire communities and left more than 10,000 people feared dead.
“Following the Haiyan Typhoon… the Holy Father has decided to send a first contribution of 150,000 dollars to help the population,” the Vatican said in a statement.
The aid “will be distributed through the local Church in the areas worst hit by the tragedy” and will be “used to support aid operations for displaced people,” it added.
Pope Francis led 60,000 people in Sunday prayers for the Philippines, urging the faithful to provide “concrete help” to the largely Roman Catholic country.
“I ask all of you to join me in prayer for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan / Yolanda especially those in the beloved islands of the Philippines,” he tweeted on Saturday.
