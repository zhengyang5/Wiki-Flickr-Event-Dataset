The AHA Centre has also prepositioned its team members and the ASEAN Emergency Rapid Assessment Team (ASEAN-ERAT) in Manila and Tacloban a day before the powerful typhoon made its landfall in the Philippines.

The Executive Director of the AHA Centre, Said Faisal stated that, â€œThe Philippines has been tested by this super typhoon and by other natural disasters this year.
The Government of Australia also provided support for the Haiyan emergency response operation by AHA Centre while the Government of Japan will deliver relief items from the Disaster Emergency Logistics System for ASEAN (DELSA) that will be mobilised soon.
