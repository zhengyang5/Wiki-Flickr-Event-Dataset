Super Typhoon Haiyan left as many as 10,000 people dead in the Philippines after storm surges flooded islands and gale-force winds knocked down buildings and destroyed an airport before moving toward Vietnam.
The United Nations said it is stepping up critical relief operations in the Philippines as a result of the “devastating” impact of Haiyan since it made landfall on Nov. 8.
“Access remains a key challenge as some areas are still cut off from relief operations,” the UN office in Manila said today in an e-mailed statement.
Almost 9.5 million Filipinos, or about 9 percent of the population, were affected by Haiyan, the agency said.
Neither Vietnam nor the Philippines issued any announcements that financial-market operations will be affected tomorrow.
