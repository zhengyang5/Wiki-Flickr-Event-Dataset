Located at Naval Base Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) is the U.S. Department of Defense agency responsible for issuing tropical cyclone warnings for the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
For example, the U.S. National Weather Service, in close cooperation with JTWC, utilizes JTWC tropical cyclone warnings to provide local scale forecasts for the various political entities that exist in the geographical region known as Micronesia.
Although not an official member or participant in the United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO), JTWC continually attempts to maintain cordial relations with WMO tropical cyclone forecast centers to minimize the issuance of conflicting information.
JTWC tropical cyclone warning support is conducted 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
This area of responsibility encompasses more than 90% of the world's tropical cyclone activity.
