But sadly this year, some of these boxes -- especially to islands worst-hit by the typhoon -- may not arrive in time.
Ysrael Laude, from LBC Mabuhay KL, said: "LBC are encouraging our fellow countrymen to send some donations so that we can give to our LBC foundation.
Mr Laude added: "At least if they offer their services or even just a little space for us, at least we can send (relief goods) everyday."
While access to disaster-hit areas in the Philippines is a challenge, there is no telling whether these boxes will get to victims in Tacloban and nearby islands in time.
Still, there is no stopping the Filipino community and the Malaysian public to lend a helping hand, to provide moral support and courage for victims of typhoon through these difficult times.
