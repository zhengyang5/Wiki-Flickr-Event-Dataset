Two of the three CH-146 Griffon helicopters are scheduled to deploy Sunday from Canadian Forces Base Trenton aboard a military transport craft, Defence Minister Rob Nicholson announced Saturday.
Nicholson said the helicopters will provide assistance to the Disaster Assistance Response Team, which is currently on the ground helping with relief efforts.
“The government of Canada and all Canadians are committed to helping relief and stabilization efforts in the Philippines,” Nicholson said in a statement.
Canada’s ambassador-designate to the Philippines said Saturday that three additional consular staff are being sent to the city of Roxas, to work with the Canadian Forces and local officials.
