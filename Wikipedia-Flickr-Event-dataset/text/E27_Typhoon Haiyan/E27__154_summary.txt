-- PHOTO: APMANILA, Philippines (AP) - Grammy-winning singer Alicia Keys has visited an air force base in Manila to bring cheer to hundreds of evacuees from eastern Philippine provinces wracked by Typhoon Haiyan earlier this month.
The American singer distributed crayons and coloring books to children at the Villamor Air Base grandstand, where evacuees from eastern Leyte and Samar provinces arrive via C-130 planes.
Social Welfare Department officer Jane Abello says Keys stayed for about half an hour on Monday to chat with evacuees.
