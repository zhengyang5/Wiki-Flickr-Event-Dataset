Typhoon Haiyan: Australian emergency medical team heads for PhilippinesUpdatedA medical team leading Australia's humanitarian relief effort has been briefed about the aid situation in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan.
Two RAAF planes - a Globemaster and a Hercules - are flying from Darwin transporting aid and Australia's fast response medical team.
The Globemaster is packed with 25 tonnes of emergency and medical supplies to Tacloban City, one of the areas worst affected by the typhoon.
Lieutenant Taylor says the air force intends to transport all the supplies onto the island and the Hercules with the medical team bound for Tacloban.
The fast response medical team has spent the past two days gathering in Darwin and preparing for the mission.
