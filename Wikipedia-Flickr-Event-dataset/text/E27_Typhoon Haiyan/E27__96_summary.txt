New Zealand will donate another $2.9 million to those affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully said this morning.
The Government has now contributed $5.1 million in total to the region, where 4000 were killed in last week's massive storm and four million people displaced.
Mr McCully said the aid package included direct funding for emergency supplies; including food, water, tarpaulins, generators, kitchen sets and chainsaws.

Over the weekend, the aircraft delivered 30 tonnes of rice, tinned food, water, emergency shelter and hospital equipment to the worst-hit cities Tacloban and Ormoc and the township of Guiuan.
