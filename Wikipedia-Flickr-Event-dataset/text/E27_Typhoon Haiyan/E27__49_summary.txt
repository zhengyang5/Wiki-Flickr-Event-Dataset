TACLOBAN, Philippines (Reuters) - A U.S. aircraft carrier started unloading food and water in the typhoon-ravaged central Philippines, while the United Nations, citing government figures, put the latest death toll at 4,460 - almost double the last official number given.
The dead are still being buried one week after the storm and a tsunami-like wall of seawater slammed into coastal areas.
The carrier moved some fixed-wing aircraft ashore to make more room for the helicopters on its flight deck.
Another U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, led a massive aid operation off Indonesiaâ€™s Aceh province after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.
