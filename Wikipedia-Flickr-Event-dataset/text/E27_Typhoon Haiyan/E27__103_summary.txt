Middle Eastern countries employ an estimated 2 million Filipino migrant workers, often illegally, giving them a strong if sometimes problematic connection to the Philippines.
With an estimated 2 million Filipinos living in the Middle East, these countries all have a very human link to the Philippines.
But it is also a problematic one, since some Filipino migrant workers arrive illegally or stay on after their visas have expired, risking deportation of themselves and/or their children.
So even as Prince Talal was pledging $100,000, hundreds of Filipino workers were being brought to a deportation center.
While many migrant workers have lived in the region for years, and raised funds for previous disasters, typhoon Haiyan is on a far bigger scale.
