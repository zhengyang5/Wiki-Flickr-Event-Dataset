MANILA, Philippines — President Benigno Aquino III on Thursday assured the public of the government’s readiness to face supertyphoon “Yolanda” which will directly hit Samar and Leyte at midnight.
He said that relief goods are also pre-positioned in many of the areas expected to be affected by the supertyphoon.
“Yolanda” is expected to bring winds and rain stronger than “Pablo,” the last supertyphoon to hit the Philippines with wind speeds up to 280 kilometers per hour.
Aquino said Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and Interior Secretary Manuel “Mar” Roxas II are in Leyte to supervise preparations when the storm makes landfall in the province.
