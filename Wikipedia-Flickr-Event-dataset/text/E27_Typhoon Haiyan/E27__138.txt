Mercy Corps, the Portland-based relief organization, is sending an assessment team to the Philippines, where a typhoon has devastated the country’s midsection.

Two staff members are preparing to depart as soon as possible, and more could follow, Lindsay Murphy, a Mercy Corps spokeswoman, said Sunday.

The “emergency response team” will survey the situation and decide how Mercy Corps aid workers can best help, she said. Based on conversations with United Nations officials, Mercy Corps anticipates the most pressing needs to be clean water, sanitation, temporary shelter and food.

Nonprofit Mercy Corps doesn’t have an office in the Philippines, but a couple of staff members happen to be based in Manila, working on economic development and social programs.

“We’re looking at some partner organizations on the ground we can work through,” Murphy said.

Murphy said the organization is taking donations, with information available on its Web site. Tigard-based Medical Teams International is taking donations to send emergency health kits containing medicines for typhoon victims.

World Vision, of Federal Way, Wash., is sending relief flights, the first one scheduled to arrive in Manila Monday with 5,000 blankets and 3,000 tarpaulins for survivors to build temporary shelters.

More than 500 World Vision aid workers in the Philippines are helping to provide food, non-food items, hygiene kits, emergency shelter and protection, especially for children and women. The storm’s impact zone includes 20 development project areas where World Vision works with more than 35,000 sponsored children and their communities.
