WASHINGTON â€” U.S. officials say five Americans have died in Philippines' Typhoon Haiyan (HY-ahn) and hundreds of other Americans have received assistance.

Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the State Department's Scot Marciel provided the updated U.S. death toll.

He said Tuesday U.S. officials have received more than 1,000 calls seeking information about Americans. About 475 people have been located.

The White House says the U.S. is now providing $37 million in humanitarian aid to victims of the deadly Nov. 8 storm. That's almost double what the U.S. has previously announced.

The typhoon was among the strongest on record. It killed or has left missing more than 5,000 people and displaced an estimated 4 million people. A major international relief mission is under way to help survivors.
