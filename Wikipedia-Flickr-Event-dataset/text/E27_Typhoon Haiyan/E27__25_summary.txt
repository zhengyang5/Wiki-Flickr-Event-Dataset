To get to Tacloban, the small city in Leyte province in the Philippines that was flattened on Friday by typhoon Haiyan, you have to manoeuvre through piled-up bodies, uprooted trees, jagged pieces of debris and survivors staggering around searching for food, water and supplies.
The coastal city of 222,000 inhabitants bore the brunt of 195mph winds as the strongest storm ever recorded tore off roofs and destroyed evacuation centres.
At least 10,000 people are thought to have died so far in Leyte province alone, with the toll expected to rise.
Local officials warned the Philippine president, Benigno Aquino III – who visited Tacloban yesterday – that residents from nearby towns were entering the city to steal supplies and pleaded with him to declare martial law.
"It was like a tsunami," said Philippine interior secretary Mar Roxas, who visited Tacloban yesterday by helicopter.
