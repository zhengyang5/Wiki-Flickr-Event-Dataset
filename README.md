# Wikipedia-Flickr-Event-Dataset-PCM2018
This is to release the well-labeled but weakly-aligned dataset we collected for cross-modality event retrieval. The dataset consists of 28,825 images on Flickr and 11,960 text articles from hundreds of social media, belonging to 82 categories of events.

The links of the images are included and can be downloaded from the URLs.

Please cite the paper if you are using the dataset.
